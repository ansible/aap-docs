= Connecting {HubName} to a {RHSSO} environment

To connect {HubName} to a {RHSSO} installation, configure inventory variables in the `inventory` file before you run the installer setup script.

You must configure a different set of variables when connecting to a {RHSSO} installation managed by {PlatformNameShort} than when connecting to an external {RHSSO} installation.
