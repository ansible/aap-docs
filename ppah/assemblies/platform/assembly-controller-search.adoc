:context: search-controller

Use {ControllerName}'s search tool for search and filter capabilities across multiple functions. 
An expandable "cheat-sheet" is available from the *Advanced* option from the *Name* menu in the search field. 

From there, use the combination of *Set Type*, *Key*, and *Lookup type* to filter.
