= Custom Credential Types

As a system administrator, you can define a custom credential type in a standard format using a YAML or JSON-like definition,
permitting the assignment of new credential types to jobs and inventory updates. 
You can define a custom credential type that works in ways similar to existing credential types, such as a custom credential type that injects an API token for a third-party web service into an environment variable, for your playbook or custom inventory script to consume.

Custom credentials support the following ways of injecting their authentication information:

* Environment variables
* Ansible extra variables
* File-based templating, that is, generating `.ini` or `.conf` files that contain credential values

You can attach one SSH and multiple cloud credentials to a Job Template.
Each cloud credential must be of a different type. 
Only one of each type of credential is permitted. 
Vault credentials and machine credentials are separate entities.

[NOTE]
====
* When creating a new credential type, you must avoid collisions in the `extra_vars`, `env`, and file namespaces.
* Environment variable or extra variable names must not start with `ANSIBLE_` because they are reserved. 
* You must have System administrator (superuser) permissions to be able to create and edit a credential type (`CredentialType`) and to be
able to view the `CredentialType.injection` field.
