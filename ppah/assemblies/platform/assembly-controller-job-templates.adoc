= Working with job templates

A job template combines an Ansible playbook from a project and the settings required to launch it. 
Job templates are useful to execute the same job many times. Job templates also encourage the reuse of Ansible playbook content and collaboration between teams. 
For more information, see link:https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/userguide/job_templates.html[Job Templates] in the Automation Controller User Guide.
