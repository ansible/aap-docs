= Working with Webhooks

A Webhook enables you to execute specified commands between applications over the web. 
{ControllerNameStart} currently provides webhook integration with GitHub and GitLab. 

Set up a webhook using the following services:

* xref:controller-set-up-github-webhook[Setting up a GitHub webhook]
* xref:controller-set-up-gitlab-webhook[Setting up a GitLab webhook]
* xref:controller-view-payload-output[Viewing a payload output]

The webhook post-status-back functionality for GitHub and GitLab is designed to work only under certain CI events. 
Receiving another kind of event results in messages such as the following in the service log:

`awx.main.models.mixins Webhook event did not have a status API endpoint associated, skipping.`
