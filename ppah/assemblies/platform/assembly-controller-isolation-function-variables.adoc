= Isolation functionality and variables

{ControllerNameStart} uses container technology to isolate jobs from each other. 
By default, only the current project is exposed to the container running a job template.

You might find that you need to customize your playbook runs to expose additional directories. 

To fine tune your use of job isolation, there are certain variables that can be set.

By default, {ControllerName} uses the system's `/tmp` directory as its staging area. 
You can change this in the *Job Execution Path* field on the *Jobs settings* page, or in the REST API at `/api/v2/settings/jobs`, using:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
AWX_ISOLATION_BASE_PATH = "/opt/tmp"
----

If there are any additional directories to be exposed from the host to the container that playbooks run in, you can specify those in the *Paths to Expose to Isolated Jobs* field of the *Jobs settings* page, or in the REST API at `/api/v2/settings/jobs`, using:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
AWX_ISOLATION_SHOW_PATHS = ['/list/of/', '/paths']
----

[NOTE]
====
If your playbooks use keys or settings defined in `/var/lib/awx/.ssh` you must add it to `AWX_ISOLATION_SHOW_PATHS`.
====

These fields can be found on the *Jobs Settings* page.
