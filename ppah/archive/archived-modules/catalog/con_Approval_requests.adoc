== Approval Requests

Approval requests are created when a user orders a product that has an approval policy attached to it. The order will initiate the approval processes assigned to the product and users designated as approvers in each approval process receive an email notifying them that a request is ready.

Users logging in to {ProductName} can access approval requests via the following tabs:

* *My requests* - Requests that the user can approve based on their group permissions.
* *All requests* - All requests across all approver groups.
* *Approval processes* - List of approval processes that can be configured by the Approval Administrator. Accessible by the Approval Administrator only.
