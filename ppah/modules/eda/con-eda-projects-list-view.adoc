= Projects list view

On the *Projects* page, you can view the projects that you have created along with the *Status* and the *Git hash*.

[NOTE]
====
If a rulebook changes in source control you can re-sync a project by selecting the sync icon next to the project from the *Projects* list view. 
The *Git hash* updates represent the latest commit on that repository. 
An activation must be restarted or recreated if you want to use the updated project.
