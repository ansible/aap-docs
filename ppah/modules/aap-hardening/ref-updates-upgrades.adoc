= Updates and upgrades

[role="_abstract"]

All upgrades should be no more than two major versions behind what you are currently upgrading to. For example, to upgrade to {ControllerName} 4.3, you must first be on version 4.1.x because there is no direct upgrade path from version 3.8.x or earlier. Refer to link:https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/upgrade-migration-guide/upgrade_considerations.html[Upgrading to Ansible Automation Platform] for additional information. To run {ControllerName} 4.3, you must also have Ansible 2.12 or later.
