= Audit and logging functionality

For any administrative access, it is important to audit and watch for actions. 
For the system overall, you can do this through the built in audit support and the built-in logging support.

For {ControllerName}, you can do this through the built-in Activity Stream support that logs all changes within {ControllerName}, as well as through the automation logs.

Best practices dictate collecting logging and auditing centrally rather than reviewing it on the local system. 
You must configure {ControllerName} to use standard IDs or logging and auditing (Splunk) in your environment. 
{ControllerName} includes built-in logging integrations such as Elastic Stack, Splunk, Sumologic, and Loggly.
