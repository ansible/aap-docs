= Edit Projects in an Organization

When editing a project in an organization for which they are the administrator, system administrators and organization administrators can specify:

* One or more users or teams that are project administrators
* One or more users or teams that are project members
* One or more users or teams that can update the project from SCM, from among the users and teams that are members of that organization.

Users who are members of a project can view their project administrators.

Project administrators implicitly inherit the capability to update the project from SCM.

Administrators can also specify one or more users or teams (from those that are members of that project) that can use that project in a job template.
