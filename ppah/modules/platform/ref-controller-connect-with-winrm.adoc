= Connect to Windows with winrm

By default, {ControllerName} attempts to `ssh` to hosts. 

You must add the `winrm` connection information to the group variables to which the Windows hosts belong. 

To get started, edit the Windows group in which the hosts reside and place the variables in the source or edit screen for the group.

To add `winrm` connection info:

* Edit the properties for the selected group by clicking on the Edit image:leftpencil.png[Edit,15,15] icon of the group name that contains the Windows servers. 
In the "variables" section, add your connection information as follows: `ansible_connection: winrm`

When complete, save your edits. 
If Ansible was previously attempting an SSH connection and failed, you should re-run the job template.
