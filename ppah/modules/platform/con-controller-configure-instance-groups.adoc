= Configure instance groups from the API

You can create instance groups by POSTing to `/api/v2/instance_groups` as a system administrator.

Once created, you can associate instances with an instance group using:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
HTTP POST /api/v2/instance_groups/x/instances/ {'id': y}`
----

An instance that is added to an instance group automatically reconfigures itself to listen on the group's work queue. 
For more information, see the following section _Instance group policies_.
