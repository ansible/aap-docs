= Reusing an external database causes installations to fail

Instances have been reported where reusing the external database during subsequent installation of nodes causes installation failures.

.Example
You perform a clustered installation. 
Then, you need to do this again and perform a second clustered installation reusing the same external database, only this subsequent installation failed.

When setting up an external database that has been used in a prior installation, you must manually clear the database used for the clustered node before any additional installations can succeed.
