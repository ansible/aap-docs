[id="controller-google-cloud"]

= Google

Google cloud credentials are exposed as the following environment variables during playbook execution (in the job template, choose the cloud credential needed for your setup):

* `GCE_EMAIL`
* `GCE_PROJECT`
* `GCE_CREDENTIALS_FILE_PATH`

Each Google module implicitly uses these credentials when run through the controller without having to set the `service_account_email`, `project_id`, or `pem_file` module options.
