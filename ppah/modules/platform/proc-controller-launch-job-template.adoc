= Launching a job template

A benefit of {ControllerName} is the push-button deployment of Ansible playbooks. 
You can configure a template to store all the parameters that you would normally pass to the Ansible playbook on the command line. 
In addition to the playbooks, the template passes the inventory, credentials, extra variables, and all options and settings that you can specify on the command line.

Easier deployments drive consistency, by running your playbooks the same way each time, and allowing you to delegate responsibilities.

.Procedure

* Launch a job template by using one of these methods:
** From the navigation panel, select menu:Templates[Launch] next to the job template.
+
image::ug-job-template-launch.png[Job template launch]
+
** In the job template *Details* view of the job template you want to launch, click btn:[Launch].

A job can require additional information to run. 
The following data can be requested at launch:

* Credentials that were setup
* The option *Prompt on Launch* is selected for any parameter
* Passwords or passphrases that have been set to *Ask*
* A survey, if one has been configured for the job templates
* Extra variables, if requested by the job template

[NOTE]
====
If a job has user-provided values, then those are respected upon relaunch. 
If the user did not specify a value, then the job uses the default value from the job template. 
Jobs are not relaunched as-is. 
They are relaunched with the user prompts re-applied to the job template.
====

If you provide values on one tab, return to a previous tab, continuing to the next tab results in having to re-provide values on the rest of the tabs.
Ensure that you fill in the tabs in the order that the prompts appear.

When launching, {ControllerName} automatically redirects the web browser to the *Job Status* page for this job under the *Jobs* tab.

You can re-launch the most recent job from the list view to re-run on all hosts or just failed hosts in the specified inventory.
For more information, see the xref:controller-jobs[Jobs] section.

When slice jobs are running, job lists display the workflow and job slices, as well as a link to view their details individually.

[NOTE]
====
You can launch jobs in bulk using the newly added endpoint in the API, `/api/v2/bulk/job_launch`. 
This endpoint accepts JSON and you can specify a list of unified job templates (such as job templates and project updates) to launch. 
The user must have the appropriate permission to launch all the jobs. 
If all jobs are not launched an error is returned indicating why the operation was not able to complete. 
Use the `OPTIONS` request to return relevant schema. 
For more information, see the link:https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/controllerapi/api_ref.html#/Bulk[Bulk endpoint] of the Reference section of the Automation Controller API Guide.
