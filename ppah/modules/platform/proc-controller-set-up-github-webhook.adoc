= Setting up a GitHub webhook

{ControllerNameStart} has the ability to run jobs based on a triggered webhook event coming in. 
Job status information (pending, error, success) can be sent back only for pull request events. 
If you do not need {ControllerName} to post job statuses back to the webhook service, go directly to step 3.

.Procedure

. Generate a _Personal Access Token_ (PAT) for use with {ControllerName}:
.. In the profile settings of your GitHub account, select *Settings*.
.. From the navigation panel, select menu:<> Developer Settings[].
.. On the *Developer Settings* page, select *Personal access tokens*.
.. From the *Personal access tokens* screen, click btn:[Generate a personal access token].
.. When prompted, enter your GitHub account password to continue.
.. In the *Note* field, enter a brief description about what this PAT is used for.
.. In the *Select scopes* fields, check the boxes next to *repo:status*, *repo_deployment*, and *public_repo*. 
The automation webhook only needs repository scope access, with the exception of invites.
For more information, see link:https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps[Scopes for OAuth apps documentation].
.. Click btn:[Generate token].
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
When the token is generated, ensure that you copy the PAT, as you need it in step 2. 
You cannot access this token again in GitHub.
====
+
. Use the PAT to optionally create a GitHub credential:
.. Go to your instance, and xref:ref-controller-credential-gitHub-pat[Create a new credential for the GitHub PAT] using the generated token.
.. Make note of the name of this credential, as you use it in the job template that posts back to GitHub.

.. Go to the job template with which you want to enable webhooks, and select the webhook service and credential you created in the preceding step.

.. Click btn:[Save]. Your job template is set up to post back to GitHub.
. Go to a GitHub repository where you want to configure webhooks and select menu:Settings[].
. From the navigation panel, select menu:Webhooks[Add webhook].
. To complete the *Add webhook* page, you must check the *Enable Webhook* option in a job template or workflow job template. 
For more information, see step 3 in both xref:controller-create-job-template[Creating a job template] and xref:controller-create-workflow-template[Creating a workflow template].
. Complete the following fields:
* *Payload URL*: Copy the contents of the *Webhook URL* from the job template and paste it here.
The results are sent to this address from GitHub.
* *Content type*: Set it to *application/json*.
* *Secret*: Copy the contents of the *Webhook Key* from the job template and paste it here.
* *Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?*: Select the types of events you want to trigger a webhook. 
Any such event will trigger the job or workflow. 
To have the job status (pending, error, success) sent back to GitHub, you must select *Pull requests* in the *Let me select individual events* section.
