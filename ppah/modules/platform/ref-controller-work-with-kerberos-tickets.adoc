= Working with Kerberos Tickets

Ansible defaults to automatically managing Kerberos tickets when both the username and password are specified in the machine credential for a host that is configured for Kerberos. 
A new ticket is created in a temporary credential cache for each host, before each task executes (to minimize the chance of ticket expiration). 
The temporary credential caches are deleted after each task, and do not interfere with the default credential cache.

To disable automatic ticket management, that is, to use an existing SSO ticket or call `kinit` manually to populate the default credential cache, set `ansible_winrm_kinit_mode=manual` in the inventory.

Automatic ticket management requires a standard `kinit` binary on the control host system path. 
To specify a different location or binary name, set the `ansible_winrm_kinit_cmd` inventory variable to the fully-qualified path to an MIT krbv5 kinit-compatible binary.
