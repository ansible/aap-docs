[id="controller-aws-cloud"]

= Amazon Web Services

Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud credentials are exposed as the following environment variables during playbook execution (in the job template, choose the cloud credential needed for your setup):

* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
* `AWS-SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

Each AWS module implicitly uses these credentials when run through the controller without having to set the `aws_access_key_id` or `aws_secret_access_key` module options.
