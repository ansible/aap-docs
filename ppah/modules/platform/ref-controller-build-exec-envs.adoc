= Building an Execution Environment

Using Ansible content that depends on non-default dependencies (custom virtual environments) can complicate matters. 
Packages must be installed on each node, interact well with other software installed on the host system, and be kept in synchronization. Previously, jobs ran in a virtual environment at `/var/lib/awx/venv/ansible`, which was pre-loaded with dependencies for ansible-runner and certain types of Ansible content used by the Ansible control machine.

To simplify this process, container images can be built that serve as Ansible
link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/getting_started/basic_concepts.html#control-node[Control nodes]. 
These container images are referred to as automation {ExecEnvShort}s, which you can create with ansible-builder.
Ansible-runner can then make use of those images.
