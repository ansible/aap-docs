= Pinning instances manually to specific groups

If you have a special instance which needs to be exclusively assigned to a specific instance group but do not want it to automatically join other groups by "percentage" or "minimum" policies:

.Procedure

. Add the instance to one or more instance groups' `policy_instance_list`.
. Update the instance's `managed_by_policy` property to be `False`.

This prevents the instance from being automatically added to other groups based on percentage and minimum policy.
It only belongs to the groups you have manually assigned it to:
