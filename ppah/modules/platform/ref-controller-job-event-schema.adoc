[id="ref-controller-job-event-schema"]

This logger reflects the data being saved into job events, except when they would otherwise conflict with expected standard fields from the logger, in which case the fields are nested. 
Notably, the field host on the `job_event` model is given as `event_host`. 
There is also a sub-dictionary field, `event_data` within the payload, which contains different fields depending on the specifics of the Ansible event.

This logger also includes the common fields in xref:ref-controller-log-message-schema[Log message schema].
