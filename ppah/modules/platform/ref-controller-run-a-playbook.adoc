= Unable to run a playbook

If you are unable to run the `helloworld.yml` example playbook from the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.4/html-single/getting_started_with_automation_controller/index#controller-projects[Managing projects] section of the _{ControllerGS}_ guide due to playbook errors, try the following:

* Ensure that you are authenticating with the user currently running the commands.
If not, check how the username has been set up or pass the `--user=username` or `-u username` commands to specify a user.
* Is your YAML file correctly indented? 
You might need to line up your whitespace correctly. 
Indentation level is significant in YAML. 
You can use `yamlint` to check your playbook.
