The Workflow Visualizer provides a graphical way of linking together job templates, workflow templates, project syncs, and inventory syncs to build a workflow template. 
Before you build a workflow template, see the xref:controller-workflows[Workflows] section for considerations associated with various scenarios on parent, child, and sibling nodes.
