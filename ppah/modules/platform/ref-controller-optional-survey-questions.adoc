= Optional survey questions

The *Required* setting on a survey question determines whether the answer is optional or not for the user interacting with it.

Optional survey variables can also be passed to the playbook in `extra_vars`.

* If a non-text variable (input type) is marked as optional, and is not filled in, no survey `extra_var` is passed to the playbook.
* If a text input or text area input is marked as optional, is not filled in, and has a minimum `length > 0`, no survey `extra_var` is passed to the playbook.
* If a text input or text area input is marked as optional, is not filled in, and has a minimum `length === 0`, that survey `extra_var` is passed to the playbook, with the value set to an empty string ("").
