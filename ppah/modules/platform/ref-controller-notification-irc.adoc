= IRC

The IRC notification takes the form of an IRC bot that connects, delivers its messages to channels or individual users, and then disconnects. 
The notification bot also supports SSL authentication. 
The bot does not currently support Nickserv identification. 
If a channel or user does not exist or is not online then the notification fails. 
The failure scenario is reserved specifically for connectivity.

Provide the following details to set up an IRC notification:

* Optional: *IRC server password*: IRC servers can require a password to connect. 
If the server does not require one, leave it blank.
*IRC server port*: The IRC server port.
*IRC server address*: The host name or address of the IRC server.
*IRC nick*: The bot's nickname once it connects to the server.
*Destination channels or users*: A list of users or channels to which the notification is sent.
* Optional: *Disable SSL verification*: Check if you want the bot to use SSL when connecting.
