= SCM inventory jobs

When an inventory sourced from an SCM, for example git, is executed, the results are displayed in the *Output* tab. 
If used, the Ansible CLI displays the same information. This can be useful for debugging.
Use the icons in the navigation menu to relaunch (image:rightrocket.png[Rightrocket,15,15]), download (image:download.png[Download,15,15]) the job output, or delete (image:delete-button.png[Delete,15,15]) the job.
