= Use an unreleased module from Ansible source with {ControllerName}

If there is a feature that is available in the latest Ansible core branch that you want to use with your {ControllerName} system, making use of it in {ControllerName} is simple.

First, determine which is the updated module you want to use from the available Ansible Core Modules or Ansible Extra Modules GitHub repositories.

Next, create a new directory, at the same directory level of your Ansible source playbooks, named `/library`.

When this is created, copy the module you want to use and drop it into the `/library` directory. 
It is consumed first by your system modules and can be removed once you have updated the the stable version with your normal package manager.
