= High availability {HubName}

A high availability (HA) configuration increases reliability and scalablility for {HubName} deployments.

HA deployments of {HubName} have multiple nodes that concurrently run the same service with a load balancer distributing workload (an "active-active" configuration).
This configuration eliminates single points of failure to minimize service downtime and allows you to easily add or remove nodes to meet workload demands.
