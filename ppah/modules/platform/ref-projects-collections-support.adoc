= Collections Support

{ControllerNameStart} supports project-specific link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html[Ansible collections] in job runs. 
If you specify a collections requirements file in the SCM at `collections/requirements.yml`, {ControllerName} installs collections in that file in the implicit project synchronization before a job run.

{ControllerNameStart} has a system-wide setting that enables collections to be dynamically downloaded from the `collections/requirements.yml` file for SCM projects. 
You can turn off this setting in the *Jobs settings* tab of the *Settings* menu by switching the *Enable Collections Download*
toggle button to *Off*.

Roles and collections are locally cached for performance reasons, and you select *Update Revision on Launch* in the project SCM
Update Options to ensure this:
