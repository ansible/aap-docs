[IMPORTANT]
====
Jobs are scheduled in UTC. 
Repeating jobs that run at a specific time of day can move relative to a local time zone when Daylight Savings Time shifts occur. 
The system resolves the local time zone based time to UTC when the schedule is saved. 
To ensure your schedules are correctly created, set your schedules in UTC time.

Use the *On* or *Off* toggle to stop an active schedule or activate a stopped schedule.
