= Users - Tokens

The *Tokens* tab is only present for your user (yourself). 
Before you add a token for your user, you might want to link:https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/userguide/applications_auth.html#ug-applications-auth-create[Create an application] if you want to
associate your token with it. 

You can also create a _Personal Access Token_ (PAT) without associating it with any application. 

Use the following method to create a token for your user:

.Procedure
. Select your user from the *Users* list view to configure your OAuth 2 tokens.
. Select the *Tokens* tab from your user's profile.
. Click btn:[Add] to open the *Create Token* window.
. Enter the following information:
* *Application*: Enter the name of the application with which you want to associate your token. 
+
Alternatively, you can search for the application name clicking the image:search.png[Search,15,15] icon. 
This opens a separate window that enables you to choose from the available options. 
Use the Search bar to filter by name if the list is extensive. 
+
Leave this field blank if you want to create a PAT that is not linked to any application.
* Optional: *Description*: Provide a short description for your token.
* *Scope*: Specify the level of access you want this token to have.
. Click btn:[Save] or btn:[Cancel] to abandon your changes.
. After the token is saved, the newly created token for the user is displayed.
