= Unable to login to {ControllerName} through HTTP

Access to {ControllerName} is intentionally restricted through a secure protocol (HTTPS). 
In cases where your configuration is set up to run an {ControllerName} node behind a load balancer or proxy as "HTTP only", and you only want to access it without SSL (for troubleshooting, for example), you must add the following settings in the `custom.py` file located at `/etc/tower/conf.d` of your {ControllerName} instance:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = False
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = False
----

If you change these settings to `false` it enables {ControllerName} to manage cookies and login sessions when using the HTTP protocol. 
You must do this on every node of a cluster installation.

To apply the changes, run:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
automation-controller-service restart
----
