[id="controller-notification-workflow"]

= Notification workflow

When a job succeeds or fails, the error or success handler pulls a list of relevant notification templates using the procedure defined in the xref:controller-notifications[Notifications] section.

It then creates a notification object for each one, containing relevant details about the job and sends it to the destination. 
These include email addresses, slack channels, and SMS numbers. 

These notification objects are available as related resources on job types (jobs, inventory updates, project updates), and also at `/api/v2/notifications`. 
You can also see what notifications have been sent from a notification template by examining its related resources.

If a notification fails, it does not impact the job associated with it or cause it to fail. 
The status of the notification can be viewed at its detail endpoint `/api/v2/notifications/<n>`.
