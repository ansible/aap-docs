= Using OAuth 2 Token System for Personal Access Tokens

The easiest and most common way to obtain an OAuth 2 token is to create a personal access token (PAT) at the `/api/v2/users/<userid>/personal_tokens/` endpoint, as shown in the following example:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
curl -XPOST -k -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{"description":"Personal controller CLI token", "application":null, "scope":"write"}' https://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<CONTROLLER_SERVER>/api/v2/users/<USER_ID>/personal_tokens/ | python -m json.tool
----

You could also pipe the JSON output through `jq`, if installed.

The following is an example of using the PAT to access an API endpoint using curl:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST  -d '{}' https://controller/api/v2/job_templates/5/launch/
----

In {ControllerName}, the OAuth 2 system is built on top of the link:https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[Django Oauth Toolkit], which provides dedicated endpoints for authorizing, revoking, and refreshing tokens. 

These endpoints can be found under the `/api/v2/users/<USER_ID>/personal_tokens/` endpoint, which also provides examples on typical use of those endpoints. 
These special OAuth 2 endpoints only support use of the `x-www-form-urlencoded` *Content-type*, so none of the `api/o/*` endpoints accept `application/json`.

[NOTE]
====
You can also request tokens using the `/api/o/token` endpoint by specifying `null` for the application type.
