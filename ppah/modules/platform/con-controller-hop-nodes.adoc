= Hop Nodes

Hop nodes have very low memory and CPU use and there is no significant advantage in vertically scaling hop nodes. 
A hop node that serves as the sole connection of many execution nodes to the control plane must be monitored for network bandwidth use. 
If this is seen to be saturated, changes to the network might be worth considering.
