[id="controller-container-capacity"]

= Container capacity limits

Capacity limits and quotas for containers are defined by objects in the Kubernetes API:

* To set limits on all pods within a given namespace, use the `LimitRange` object. 
For more information see the link:https://docs.openshift.com/online/pro/dev_guide/compute_resources.html#overview[Quotas and Limit Ranges] section of the OpenShift documentation.
* To set limits directly on the pod definition launched by {ControllerName}, see xref:controller-customize-pod-spec[Customizing the pod specification] and the link:https://docs.openshift.com/online/pro/dev_guide/compute_resources.html#dev-compute-resources[Compute Resources] section of the OpenShift documentation.

[NOTE]
====
Container groups do not use the capacity algorithm that normal nodes use. 
You need to set the number of forks at the job template level. 
If you configure forks in {ControllerName}, that setting is passed along to the container.
