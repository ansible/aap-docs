= Building nodes scenarios

Learn how to manage nodes in the following scenarios.

.Procedure

* Click the (image:plus_icon_dark.png[Plus icon,15,15]) icon on the parent node to add a sibling node:

* Hover over the line that connects two nodes and click the plus (image:plus_icon_dark.png[Plus icon,15,15]), to insert another node in between nodes.
Clicking the plus (image:plus_icon_dark.png[Plus icon,15,15]) icon automatically inserts the node between the two nodes:

* Click btn:[START] again, to add a root node to depict a split scenario:

* At any node where you want to create a split scenario, hover over the node from which the split scenario begins and click the plus (image:plus_icon_dark.png[Plus icon,15,15]) icon.
This adds multiple nodes from the same parent node, creating sibling nodes:

[NOTE]
====
When adding a new node, the btn:[PROMPT] option also applies to workflow templates. 
Workflow templates prompt for inventory and surveys.
====

* You can undo the last inserted node by using one of these methods:
** Click on another node without making a selection. 
** Click btn:[Cancel].

The following example workflow contains all three types of jobs initiated by a job template. 
If it fails to run, you must protect the sync job.
Regardless of whether it fails or succeeds, proceed to the inventory sync job:

Refer to the key by clicking the compass (image:compass.png[Compass, 15,15]) icon to identify the meaning of the symbols and colors associated with the graphical depiction.

[NOTE]
====
If you remove a node that has a follow-on node attached to it in a workflow with a set of sibling nodes that has varying edge types, the attached node automatically joins the set of sibling nodes and retains its edge type:
