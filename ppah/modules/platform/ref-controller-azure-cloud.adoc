[id="controller-azure-cloud"]

= Azure

Azure cloud credentials are exposed as the following environment variables during playbook execution (in the job template, choose the cloud credential needed for your setup):

* `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
* `AZURE_CERT_PATH`

Each Azure module implicitly uses these credentials when run via the controller without having to set the `subscription_id` or `management_cert_path` module options.
