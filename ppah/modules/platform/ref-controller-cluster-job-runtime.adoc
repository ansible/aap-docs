= Job runtime behavior

The way jobs are run and reported to a _normal_ user of {ControllerName} does not change. 
On the system side, note the following differences:

* When a job is submitted from the API interface it is pushed into the dispatcher queue. 
Each {ControllerName} instance connects to and receives jobs from that queue using a scheduling algorithm. 
Any instance in the cluster is just as likely to receive the work and execute the task. 
If an instance fails while executing jobs, then the work is marked as permanently failed.

* Project updates run successfully on any instance that could potentially run a job. 
Projects synchronize themselves to the correct version on the instance immediately before running the job. 
If the required revision is already locally checked out and Galaxy or Collections updates are not required, then a sync cannot be performed.
* When the synchronization happens, it is recorded in the database as a project update with a `launch_type = sync` and `job_type =  run`. 
Project syncs do not change the status or version of the project; instead, they update the source tree only on the instance where they run.
* If updates are required from Galaxy or Collections, a sync is performed that downloads the required roles, consuming more space in your `/tmp file`. 
In cases where you have a large project (around 10 GB), disk space on `/tmp` can be an issue.
