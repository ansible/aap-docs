= Searching job slices

To make it easier to find slice jobs, use the search functionality to apply a search filter to:

* Job lists to show only slice jobs
* Job lists to show only parent workflow jobs of job slices
* Job template lists to only show job templates that produce slice jobs

.Procedure

* Search for slice jobs by using one of the following methods:
** To show only slice jobs in job lists, as with most cases, you can filter either on the type (jobs here) or `unified_jobs`:
+
----
/api/v2/jobs/?job_slice_count__gt=1
----
+
** To show only parent workflow jobs of job slices:
+
----
/api/v2/workflow_jobs/?job_template__isnull=false
----
+
** To show only job templates that produce slice jobs:
+
----
/api/v2/job_templates/?job_slice_count__gt=1
