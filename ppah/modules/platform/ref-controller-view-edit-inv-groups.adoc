[id="ref-controller-view-edit-inv-groups"]

= View or edit inventory groups

The groups list view displays all your inventory groups, or you can filter it to only display the root groups. 
An inventory group is considered a root group if it is not a subset of another group.

You can delete a subgroup without concern for dependencies, because {ControllerName} looks for dependencies such as child groups or hosts. 
If any exist, a confirmation window displays for you to choose whether to delete the root group and all of its subgroups and hosts; or to promote the subgroups so they become the top-level inventory groups, along with their hosts.
