[id="ref-controller-set-up-jump-host"]

= Set up a jump host to use with {ControllerName}

Credentials supplied by {ControllerName} do not flow to the jump host through ProxyCommand. 
They are only used for the end-node when the tunneled connection is set up.

You can configure a fixed user/keyfile in the AWX user's SSH configuration in the ProxyCommand definition that sets up the connection through the jump host. 

For example:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
Host tampa
Hostname 10.100.100.11
IdentityFile [privatekeyfile]

Host 10.100..
Proxycommand ssh -W [jumphostuser]@%h:%p tampa
----

You can also add a jump host to your {ControllerName} instance through Inventory variables. 

These variables can be set at either the inventory,
group, or host level. 
To add this, navigate to your inventory and in the `variables` field of whichever level you choose, add the following
variables:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
ansible_user: <user_name>
ansible_connection: ssh
ansible_ssh_common_args: '-o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p -q <user_name>@<jump_server_name>"'
