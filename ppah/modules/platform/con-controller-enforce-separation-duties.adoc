Different pieces of automation might require access to a system at different levels. 
For example, you can have low-level system automation that applies patches and performs security baseline checking, while a higher-level piece of automation deploys applications. 
By using different keys or credentials for each piece of automation, the effect of any one key vulnerability is minimized, while also enabling baseline auditing.
