= Using Collections with {HubName}

Before {ControllerName} can use {HubName} as the default source for collections content, you must create an API token in the {HubName} UI so that it could be specified in {ControllerName}. 

Use the following procedure to connect to {PrivateHubName} or a public collection, the only difference is which URL you specify.

.Procedure
. Navigate to https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/token
. Click btn:[Load token].
. Click the copy image:copy.png[Copy,15,15] icon to copy the API token to the clipboard.
+
//image:projects-ah-loaded-token-shown.png[image]
+
. To use {HubName}, create an {HubName} credential using the copied token and pointing to the URLs shown in the *Server URL* and *SSO URL* fields of the token page:
+
* *Galaxy Server URL* = `https://console.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/`
* *AUTH SEVER URL* = `https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token`
+
. To use {PrivateHubName}, create an {HubName} credential using a token retrieved from the *Repo Management* dashboard of your {PrivateHubName} and pointing to the published repository URL as shown:
//+
//image:projects-ah-repo-mgmt-get-token.png[image]
+
image:projects-ah-repo-mgmt-repos-published.png[image]
+
You can create different repositories with different namespaces or collections in them. 
For each repository in {Hubname} you must create a different credential.
+
Copy the *Ansible CLI URL* from the UI in the format of `/https://$<hub_url>/api/galaxy/content/<repo you want to pull from>` into the *Galaxy Server URL* field of the _Create Credential_ form:

For UI specific instructions, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.4/html/managing_content_in_automation_hub/managing-cert-valid-content[Red Hat Certified, validated, and Ansible Galaxy content in automation hub].

. Navigate to the organization for which you want to synchronize content from and add the new credential to the organization. 
This enables you to associate each organization with the credential, or repository, that you want to use content from.

[NOTE]
====
Suppose you have two repos:

* _Prod_: `Namespace 1` and `Namespace 2`, each with collection `A` and `B` so: `namespace1.collectionA:v2.0.0` and `namespace2.collectionB:v2.0.0`
* _Stage_: `Namespace 1` with only collection `A` so: `namespace1.collectionA:v1.5.0` on , you will have a repo URL for _Prod_
and _Stage_.

You can create a credential for each one. 

Then you can assign different levels of access to different organizations. 
For example, you can create a `Developers` organization that has access to both repos, while an Operations
organization just has access to the *Prod* repo only.

For UI specific instructions, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.4/html-single/managing_content_in_automation_hub/index#configuring-user-access-containers[Configuring user access for container repositories in private automation hub].
====

. If {HubName} has self-signed certificates, use the toggle to enable the setting *Ignore Ansible Galaxy SSL Certificate Verification*. 
For {HubName}, which uses a signed certificate, use the toggle to disable it instead. This is a global setting:
+

+
. Create a project, where the source repository specifies the necessary collections in a requirements file located in the
`collections/requirements.yml` file.
For information on the syntax to use, see link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html#install-multiple-collections-with-a-requirements-file[Using Ansible collections] in the Ansible documentation.
+
image:projects-add-ah-source-repo.png[Project source repository]

. In the Projects list view, click image:sync.png[Update,15,15] to update this project. {ControllerNameStart} fetches the Galaxy collections from the `collections/requirements.yml` file and reports it as changed. 
The collections will be installed for any job template using this project.

[NOTE]
====
If updates are required from Galaxy or Collections, a sync is performed that downloads the required roles, consuming that much more space in
your /tmp file. 
In cases where you have a large project (around 10 GB), disk space on `/tmp` may be an issue.

For more information on how Red Hat itself publishes one of these official collections, which can be used to automate your
install directly, see the link:https://github.com/ansible/awx/blob/devel/awx_collection/README.md[AWX Ansible Collection] documentation.
