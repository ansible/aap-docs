[id="controller-playbook-run-search"]

= Search

Use *Search* to look up specific events, hostnames, and their statuses. 
To filter only certain hosts with a particular status, specify one of the following valid statuses:

ok:: Indicates that a task completed successfully but no change was executed on the host.
changed:: The playbook task executed. 
Since Ansible tasks should be written to be idempotent, tasks may exit successfully without executing anything on the host. 
In these cases, the task returns *ok*, but not *changed*.
failed:: The task failed. 
Further playbook execution stopped for this host.
unreachable:: The host is unreachable from the network or has another fatal error associated with it.
skipped:: The playbook task skipped because no change was necessary for the host to reach the target state.
rescued:: This shows the tasks that failed and then executes a rescue section.
ignored:: This shows the tasks that failed and have `ignore_errors: yes configured`.

These statuses also display in each *Stdout* pane, in a group of "stats" called the host summary fields:

The following example shows a search with only unreachable hosts:

For more information on using the search, see the xref:assembly-controller-search[Search] section.

The standard output view displays the events that occur on a particular job. 
By default, all rows are expanded so that the details are displayed. 
Use the collapse-all (image:ug-collapse-all-icon.png[Collapse,15,15]) icon to switch to a view that only contains the headers for plays and tasks. 
Click the plus (image:plus_icon_dark.png[Plus icon,15,15]) icon to view all the lines of the standard output.

You can display all the details of a specific play or task by clicking the arrow icons next to them. 
Click an arrow from sideways to downward to expand the lines associated with that play or task. 
Click the arrow back to the sideways position to collapse and hide the lines.

When viewing details in the expand or collapse mode, note the following:

* Each displayed line that is not collapsed has a corresponding line number and start time.
* An expand or collapse icon is at the start of any play or task after the play or task has completed.
* If querying for a particular play or task, it appears collapsed at the end of its completed process.
* In some cases, an error message appears, stating that the output may be too large to display. 
This occurs when there are more than 4000 events. 
Use the search and filter for specific events to bypass the error.

Click on a line of an event from the *Stdout* pane and a *Host Events* window displays in a separate window. 
This window shows the host that was affected by that particular event.

[NOTE]
====
Upgrading to the latest versions of {PlatformNameShort} involves progressively migrating all historical playbook output and events.
This migration process is gradual, and happens automatically in the background after installation is complete. 
Installations with very large amounts of historical job output (tens or hundreds of GB of output) can have missing job output until migration is complete. 
The most recent data shows up at the top of the output, followed by older events.
