= Memory relative capacity

`mem_capacity` is calculated relative to the amount of memory needed per fork. 
Taking into account the overhead for internal components, this is approximately 100MB per fork. 
When considering the amount of memory available to Ansible jobs, the capacity algorithm reserves 2GB of memory to account for the presence of other services. 
The algorithm formula for this is:

----
(mem - 2048) / mem_per_fork
----

The following is an example:

----
(4096 - 2048) / 100 == ~20
----

A system with 4GB of memory is capable of running 20 forks. 
The value `mem_per_fork` is controlled by setting the value of `SYSTEM_TASK_FORKS_MEM`, which defaults to 100.
