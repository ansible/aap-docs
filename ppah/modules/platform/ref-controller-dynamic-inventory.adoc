[id="ref-controller-dynamic-inventory"]

= Dynamic Inventory and private IP addresses

By default, {ControllerName} only shows instances in a VPC that have an Elastic IP (EIP) address associated with them. 

To view all of your VPC instances, perform the following steps:

* In the controller interface, select your inventory.
* Select the group that has the Source set to AWS, and select the *Source* tab.
* In the "Source Variables" box, enter: `vpc_destination_variable: private_ip_address`

Save and trigger an update of the group. 
All of your VPC instances are displayed.

[NOTE]
====
The controller must be running inside the VPC with access to those instances in order to usefully configure them.
