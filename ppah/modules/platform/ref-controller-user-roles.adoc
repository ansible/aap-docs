//This doesn't seem to fit here.
//[NOTE]
//====
//The job template administrator may not have access to other resources (inventory, project, credentials, or instance groups) associated with the template. 
//
//Without access to these, certain fields in the job template are not editable. 
//
//System Administrators can grant individual users permissions to certain resources as necessary.
//
//For more information, see xref:proc-controller-user-permissions[Adding permissions to a user].
