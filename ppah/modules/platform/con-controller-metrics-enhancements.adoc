Additional metrics include:

*awx_database_connections_total*:: Tracks the current number of open database connections. 
When included in monitoring, this can help identify when errors have occurred because of lack of available database connections.
*callback_receiver_event_processing_avg_seconds*:: Proxy for â€œhow far behind the callback receiver workers are in processing output". 
If this number stays large, consider horizontally scaling the control plane and reducing the `capacity_adjustment` value on the node.
