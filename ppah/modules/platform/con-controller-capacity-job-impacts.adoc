= Capacity job impacts

When selecting the capacity, it is important to understand how each job type affects capacity.

The default forks value for Ansible is five. 
However, if you set up {ControllerName} to run against fewer systems than that, then the actual concurrency value is lower.

When a job is run in {ControllerName}, the number of forks selected  is incremented by 1, to compensate for the Ansible parent process.  

.Example
If you run a playbook against five systems with forks value of 5, then the actual forks value from the Job Impact perspective is 6.
