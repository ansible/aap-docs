.Prerequisites

* You have installed {OperatorPlatform} on {OCPShort}.
* You have installed and configured {ControllerName}.

.Procedure

. Select menu:Operators[Installed Operators].

. Locate and select your installation of {PlatformNameShort}.

. Under *Provided APIs*, locate the {EDAName} modal and click *Create instance*. 
+
This takes you to the Form View to customize your installation.

. In the *Name* field, enter the name you want for your new {EDAcontroller} deployment. 
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have other {PlatformNameShort} components installed in your current {OCPShort} namespace, ensure that you provide a unique name for your {EDAcontroller} when you create your {EDAName} custom resource. Otherwise, naming conflicts can occur and impact {EDAcontroller} deployment.
====
+
. Specify your controller URL. 
+
If you deployed {ControllerName} in Openshift as well, you can find the URL in the navigation panel under menu:Networking[Routes].
+
[NOTE]
====
This is the only required customization, but you can customize other options using the UI form or directly in the YAML configuration tab, if desired.
====

. Click btn:[Create].
This deploys {EDAcontroller} in the namespace you specified. 
+
After a couple minutes when the installation is marked as *Successful*, you can find the URL for the {EDAName} UI on the *Routes* page in the Openshift UI. 

. From the navigation panel, select menu:Networking[Routes] to find the new Route URL that has been created for you. 
+
Routes are listed according to the name of your custom resource.

. Click the new URL to navigate to {EDAName} in the browser.

. From the navigation panel, select menu:Workloads[Secrets] and locate the Admin Password k8s secret that was created for you, unless you specified a custom one.
+
Secrets are listed according to the name of your custom resource and appended with `-admin-password.`
+
[NOTE]
====
You can use the password value in the secret to log in to the {EDAcontroller} UI. The default user is `admin`.
