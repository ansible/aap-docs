= Internal services

{ControllerNameStart} connects to the following services as part of internal operation:

PostgreSQL database::
The connection to the PostgreSQL database is done by password authentication over TCP, either through localhost or remotely (external database). 
This connection can use PostgreSQL's built in support for SSL/TLS, as natively configured by the installer support. 
SSL/TLS protocols are configured by the default OpenSSL configuration.

A Redis key or value store::
The connection to Redis is over a local UNIX socket, restricted to the awx service user.
