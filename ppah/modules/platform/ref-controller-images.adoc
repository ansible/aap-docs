[id="ref-controller-images"]

= images

Specifies the base image to be used. 
At a minimum you must specify a source, image, and tag for the base image. 
The base image provides the operating system and can also provide some packages. 
Use the standard `host/namespace/container:tag` syntax to specify images.
You can use Podman or Docker shortcut syntax instead, but the full definition is more reliable and portable.

Valid keys for this section are:
