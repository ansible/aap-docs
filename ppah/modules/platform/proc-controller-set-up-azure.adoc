= {Azure} active directory authentication

To set up enterprise authentication for {Azure} Active Directory (AD), you need to obtain an OAuth2 key and secret by registering your organization-owned application from Azure at:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app.

Each key and secret must belong to a unique application and cannot be shared or reused between different authentication backends. 
To register the application, you must supply it with your webpage URL, which is the Callback URL shown in the *Authentication* tab of the *Settings* screen.

.Procedure

. From the navigation panel, select menu:Settings[].
. Select *Azure AD settings* from the list of *Authentication* options.
+
[NOTE]
====
The *Azure AD OAuth2 Callback URL* field is already pre-populated and non-editable. 
Once the application is registered, {Azure} displays the Application ID and Object ID.
====
. Click btn:[Edit], copy and paste {Azure}'s Application ID to the *Azure AD OAuth2 Key* field.
+
Following {Azure} AD's documentation for connecting your application to {Azure} Active Directory, supply the key (shown at one time only) to the client for authentication.
+
. Copy and paste the secret key created for your {Azure} AD application to the *Azure AD OAuth2 Secret* field of the *Settings - Authentication* screen.
. For more information on completing the {Azure} AD OAuth2 Organization Map and {Azure} AD OAuth2 Team Map fields, see xref:ref-controller-organization-mapping[Organization mapping] and xref:ref-controller-team-mapping[Team Mapping].
. Click btn:[Save].

.Verification
To verify that the authentication is configured correctly, log out of {ControllerName} and the login screen displays the {Azure} logo to enable logging in with those credentials:
