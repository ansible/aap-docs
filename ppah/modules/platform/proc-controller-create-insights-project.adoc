All SCM and project synchronizations occur automatically the first time you save a new project.
If you want them to be updated to what is current in Red Hat Insights, manually update the SCM-based project by clicking the update image:ug-update-button.png[Update,20,20] icon under the project's available actions.

This process syncs your Red Hat Insights project with your Red Hat Insights account solution. 
Note that the status dot beside the name of the project updates once the sync has run.
