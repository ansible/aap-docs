= Creating custom notifications

You can xref:controller-attributes-custom-notifications[customize the text content] of each xref:controller-notification-types[Notification type] on the notification form.

.Procedure

. On the *Notification Templates* list view click btn:[Add].
. Choose a notification type from the *Type* list.
. Enable *Customize messages* using the toggle.

+
. You can provide a custom message for various job events, such as the following:

* *Start message*
* *Success message body*
* *Error message*
* *Workflow approved message*
* *Workflow denied message*
* *Workflow running message*
* *Workflow pending message*
* *Workflow timed out message*

The message forms vary depending on the type of notification that you are configuring. 
For example, messages for Email and PagerDuty notifications appear to be a typical email, with a body and a subject, in which case, {ControllerName} displays the fields as *Message* and *Message Body*. 
Other notification types only expect a *Message* for each type of event.

The *Message* fields are pre-populated with a template containing a top-level variable, `job` coupled with an attribute, such as `id` or `name`. 
Templates are enclosed in curly brackets and can draw from a fixed set of fields provided by {ControllerName}, as shown in the pre-populated message fields:

This pre-populated field suggests commonly displayed messages to a recipient who is notified of an event. 
You can customize these messages with different criteria by adding your own attributes for the job as needed. 
Custom notification messages are rendered using Jinja; the same templating engine used by Ansible playbooks.

Messages and message bodies have different types of content, as the following points outline:

* Messages are always just strings, one-liners only. 
New lines are not supported.
* Message bodies are either a dictionary or a block of text:
** The message body for Webhooks and PagerDuty uses dictionary definitions. 
The default message body for these is `{{ job_metadata }}`, you can either leave that as it is or provide your own dictionary.
** The message body for email uses a block of text or a multi-line string. The default message body is:
+
[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
{{ job_friendly_name }} #{{ job.id }} had status {{ job.status }}, view details at {{ url }} {{ job_metadata }}
----
+
You can edit this text leaving `{{ job_metadata }}` in, or drop `{{ job_metadata }}`. 
Since the body is a block of text, it can be any string you want.
`{{ job_metadata }}` is rendered as a dictionary containing fields that describe the job being executed. 
In all cases, `{{ job_metadata }}` includes the following fields:

*** `id`
*** `name`
*** `url`
*** `created_by`
*** `started`
*** `finished`
*** `status`
*** `traceback`
+
[NOTE]
====
You cannot query individual fields within `{{ job_metadata }}`. 
When you use `{{ job_metadata }}` in a notification template, all data is returned.
====
+
The resulting dictionary looks like the following:
+
[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
{"id": 18,
 "name": "Project - Space Procedures",
 "url": "https://host/#/jobs/project/18",
 "created_by": "admin",
 "started": "2019-10-26T00:20:45.139356+00:00",
 "finished": "2019-10-26T00:20:55.769713+00:00",
 "status": "successful",
 "traceback": ""
}
----
+
If `{{ job_metadata }}` is rendered in a job, it includes the following additional fields:
+
*** `inventory`
*** `project`
*** `playbook`
*** `credential`
*** `limit`
*** `extra_vars`
*** `hosts`
+
The resulting dictionary looks like the following:
+
[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
{"id": 12,
 "name": "JobTemplate - Launch Rockets",
 "url": "https://host/#/jobs/playbook/12",
 "created_by": "admin",
 "started": "2019-10-26T00:02:07.943774+00:00",
 "finished": null,
 "status": "running",
 "traceback": "",
 "inventory": "Inventory - Fleet",
 "project": "Project - Space Procedures",
 "playbook": "launch.yml",
 "credential": "Credential - Mission Control",
 "limit": "",
 "extra_vars": "{}",
 "hosts": {}
}
----
+
If `{{ job_metadata }}` is rendered in a workflow job, it includes the following additional field:
+
*** `body` (This enumerates the nodes in the workflow job and includes a description of the job associated with each node)
+
The resulting dictionary looks like the following:
+
[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
{"id": 14,
 "name": "Workflow Job Template - Launch Mars Mission",
 "url": "https://host/#/workflows/14",
 "created_by": "admin",
 "started": "2019-10-26T00:11:04.554468+00:00",
 "finished": "2019-10-26T00:11:24.249899+00:00",
 "status": "successful",
 "traceback": "",
 "body": "Workflow job summary:

         node #1 spawns job #15, \"Assemble Fleet JT\", which finished with status successful.
         node #2 spawns job #16, \"Mission Start approval node\", which finished with status successful.\n
         node #3 spawns job #17, \"Deploy Fleet\", which finished with status successful."
}
----

If you create a notification template that uses invalid syntax or references unusable fields, an error message displays indicating the nature of the error. 
If you delete a notification's custom message, the default message is shown in its place.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you save the notifications template without editing the custom message (or edit and revert back to the default values), the *Details* screen assumes the defaults and does not display the custom message tables. If you edit and save any of the values, the entire table displays in the *Details* screen.
