= Job branch overriding

Projects specify the branch, tag, or reference to use from source control in the `scm_branch` field. 
These are represented by the values specified in the *Type Details* fields:

When creating or editing a job you have the option to *Allow Branch Override*. 
When this option is checked, project administrators can delegate branch selection to the job templates that use that project, requiring only project `use_role`.
