= GitHub Enterprise settings

To set up social authentication for a GitHub Enterprise, you must obtain a GitHub Enterprise URL, an API URL, OAuth2 key and secret for a web application. 

To obtain the URLs, refer to the link:https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.1/rest/reference/enterprise-admin[Gi[GitHub Enterprise administration] documentation. 

To obtain the key and secret, you must first register your enterprise-owned application at `https://github.com/organizations/<yourorg>/settings/applications`

To register the application, you must supply it with your Authorization callback URL, which is the *Callback URL* shown in the *Details* page. 
Because it is hosted on site and not `github.com`, you must specify which authentication adapter it comunicates with.

Each key and secret must belong to a unique application and cannot be shared or reused between different authentication backends. 
The OAuth2 key (Client ID) and secret (Client Secret) are used to supply the required fields in the UI.

.Procedure
. On the navigation panel, select menu:Settings[].
. On the *Settings* page, select *GitHub settings* from the list of Authentication options.
. Click the *GitHub Enterprise* tab.
+
The *GitHub Enterprise OAuth2 Callback URL* field is already pre-populated and non-editable. 
When the application is registered, GitHub displays the Client ID and Client Secret.

. Click btn:[Edit] to configure GitHub Enterprise settings.
. In the *GitHub Enterprise URL* field, enter the hostname of the GitHub Enterprise instance, for example, https://github.example.com.
. In the *GitHub Enterprise API URL* field, enter the API URL of the GitHub Enterprise instance, for example, https://github.example.com/api/v3
. Copy and paste GitHub's Client ID into the *GitHub Enterprise OAuth2 Key* field.
. Copy and paste GitHub's Client Secret into the *GitHub Enterprise OAuth2 Secret* field.
. For more information on completing the mapping fields, see xref:ref-controller-organization-mapping[Organization mapping] and xref:ref-controller-team-mapping[Team mapping].
. Click btn:[Save].

.Verification
To verify that the authentication was configured correctly, logout of {ControllerName}. 
The login screen displays the GitHub Enterprise logo to enable logging in with those credentials.
