Vault credentials require the *Vault Password* and an optional *Vault Identifier* if applying multi-Vault credentialing. 

For more information on the Multi-Vault support, refer to the link:https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/administration/multi-creds-assignment.html#multi-vault-credentials[Multi-Vault Credentials] section of the _{ControllerAG}_.

You can configure {ControllerName} to ask the user for the password at launch time by selecting *Prompt on launch*. 

When *Prompt on Launch* is selected, a dialog opens when the job is launched, promoting the user to enter the password and password.

[WARNING]
====
Credentials which are used in _Scheduled Jobs_ must not be configured as *Prompt on launch*.
