= Role hierarchy and access inheritance

Imagine that you have an organization named "SomeCompany" and want to give two people, "Josie" and "Carter", access to manage all the
settings associated with that organization. 
To do this, you must make both people members of the organization's `admin_role`.

There are frequently many Roles in a system, some of which you want to include all of the capabilities of other roles. 
For example, you might want a System Administrator to have access to everything that an Organization Administrator has access to, who has everything that a Project Administrator has access to.

This concept is referred to as the "Role Hierarchy":

* Parent roles get all capabilities bestowed on any child roles.
* Members of roles automatically get all capabilities for the role they are a member of, as well as any child roles.

The Role Hierarchy is represented by permitting Roles to have "Parent Roles". 
Any capability that a Role has is implicitly granted to any parent roles (or parents of those parents).

Roles can have more than one parent, and capabilities are implicitly granted to all parents.

RBACs also enable you to explicitly permit Users and Teams of Users to run playbooks against certain sets of hosts. 
Users and teams are restricted to just the sets of playbooks and hosts to which they are granted capabilities. 
With {ControllerName}, you can create or import as many Users and Teams as you require, create Users and Teams manually, or import them from LDAP or Active Directory.
