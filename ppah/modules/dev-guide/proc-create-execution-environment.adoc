= Creating {ExecEnvName}

[role="_abstract"]
An {ExecEnvName} definition file will specify::

* An Ansible version
* A Python version (defaults to system Python)
* A set of required Python libraries
* Zero or more Content Collections (optional)
* Python dependencies for those specific Collections

The concept of specifying a set of Collections for an environment is to resolve and install their dependencies. The Collections themselves are not required to be installed on the machine that you are generating the {ExecEnvName} on.

An {ExecEnvName} is built from this definition, and results in a container image. Please read the {Builder} documentation to learn the steps involved in creating these images.
