= About the metrics files

The metrics data is bundled into a tarball file. A separate file is generated for each job. The tarball files are stored in a directory that you specify during installation. You can view the contents of the files: they are not encrypted.

Each tarball file contains the following unencrypted CSV files:

* *`jobs.csv`* records the duration and status of the automation job, the number of tasks executed, and the number of hosts that were affected by the job.
* *`modules.csv`* records the module name, the task count and the duration.
* *`collections.csv`*: records the collection name, the task count and the duration.
* *`roles.csv`* records the role name, the task count and the duration.
