[id="default-file-location_{context}"]

= Default location for metrics files

When you install Ansible SDK, the default metrics storage location is set to the `{MetricsDefaultDir}` directory. 

After an automation job is complete, the metrics are written to a tarball in the directory.
Ansible SDK creates the directory if it does not already exist.
