= Viewing metrics files

[role="_abstract"]
After an automation job has completed, navigate to the directory that you specified for storing the data and list the files.

The data for the newly-completed job is contained in a tar file whose name begins with the date and time that the automation job was run.
For example, the following file records data for an automation job executed on 8 March 2023 at 2.30AM.

[source, bash]
----
$ ls

2023_03_08_02_30_24__aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa_job_data.tar.gz
----

To view the files in the tar file, run `tar xvf`.

[source, bash]
----
$ tar xvf 2023_03_08_02_30_24__aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa_job_data.tar.gz

x jobs.csv
x modules.csv
x collections.csv
x roles.csv
x playbook_on_stats.csv
----

The following example shows the `jobs.csv` file.

[source, bash]
----
$ cat jobs.csv

job_id,job_type,started,finished,job_state,hosts_ok,hosts_changed,hosts_skipped,hosts_failed,hosts_unreachable,task_count,task_duration

----

When a parameter value is not available, the corresponding entry in the CSV file is empty. In the `jobs.csv` file above, the `job_state` value is not available.
