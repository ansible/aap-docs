= Customizing the metrics storage location

You can specify the path to the directory to store your metrics files in the Python file that runs your playbook.

You can set a different directory path for every Python automation job file, or you can store the tarballs for multiple jobs in one directory.
If you do not set the path in a Python file, the tarballs for the jobs that it runs will be saved in the default directory (`{MetricsDefaultDir}`).

.Procedure

. Decide on a location on your file system to store the metrics data. Ensure that the location is readable and writable.
Ansible SDK creates the directory if it does not already exist.
. In the `job_options` in the `main()` function of your Python file, set the `metrics_output_path` parameter to the directory where the tarballs are to be stored.
+
In the following example, the metrics files are stored in the `/tmp/metrics` directory after the `pb.yml` playbook has been executed:
