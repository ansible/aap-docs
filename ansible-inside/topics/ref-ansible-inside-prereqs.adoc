{AnsibleInsideNameShort} requires a valid subscription to an {AnsibleInsideNameShort} SKU and enablement of the corresponding {RHSM} (RHSM) repository.

Contact Red Hat customer support or Red Hat sales for purchasing or attaching an {AnsibleInsideNameShort} subscription.

After a valid {AnsibleInsideNameShort} subscription has been attached to your organization within Red Hat Subscription Manager, you can enable the required repository as follows:

* RHEL 8

[source,bash]
----
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=ansible-inside-1.3-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms
----

* RHEL 9

[source,bash]
----
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=ansible-inside-1.3-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms
----

After the repository is enabled, you can proceed with installing the Ansible components.
