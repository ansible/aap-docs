== Introduction

{AnsibleInsideName} {AnsibleInsideVers} is a product bundle of Ansible Executor (runner), Ansible Core, Ansible Navigator, Ansible Builder and Ansible Execution Environments.
{AnsibleInsideNameShort} allows a Red Hat Partner to integrate Ansible automation within their application using the Command Line Interfaces of the Ansible components.

== Prerequisites

{AnsibleInsideNameShort} {AnsibleInsideVers} requires a valid subscription to an {AnsibleInsideNameShort} SKU and enablement of the corresponding {RHSM} (RHSM) repository.

Contact Red Hat customer support or Red Hat sales for purchasing or attaching an {AnsibleInsideNameShort} subscription. 

After a valid {AnsibleInsideNameShort} subscription has been attached to your organization within Red Hat Subscription Manager, you can enable the required repository as follows:

* RHEL 8

[source,bash]
----
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=ansible-inside-1.1-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms
----

* RHEL 9

[source,bash]
----
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=ansible-inside-1.1-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms
----

After the repository is enabled, you can proceed with installing the Ansible components.
