= Metrics file locations

[role="_abstract"]
Reporting metrics to Red Hat is a requirement. Logging metrics for your automation jobs is automatically enabled when you install Ansible SDK. You cannot disable it.

Every time an automation job runs, a new tar file is created. You are responsible for scraping the data from the storage location and for monitoring the size of the directory. 

You can customize the metrics storage location for each Python file that runs a playbook, or you can use the default location.
