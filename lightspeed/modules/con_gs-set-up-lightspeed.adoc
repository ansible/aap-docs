= Configuring and managing the Ansible Lightspeed service

As a Red Hat organization administrator, perform the following tasks to set up and manage {LightspeedShortName} for your organization:

. Choose your deployment

== Choosing your deployment

As an organization administrator, choose your deployment from the following options:

* Start a free 90-day trial of Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed
+
This is especially useful as you do not need a trial or paid subscription to {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant}. After your 90-day trial expires, you must set up the cloud service or on-premise deployment to continue accessing the Ansible Lightspeed service.
For more information, see xref:start-lightspeed-trial_lightspeed-user-guide[Starting a trial of {LightspeedShortName}]. 

* Set up a Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed cloud service or on-premise deployment
Configure the Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed cloud service or on-premise deployment and connect it to your IBM watsonx Code Assistant instance. You must have a trial or paid subscription to both Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform and IBM watsonx Code Assistant. 
For additional information, see xref:configure-lightspeed-cloud-service_set-up-lightspeed[Setting up the cloud service] and xref:configuring-lightspeed-onpremise_set-up-lightspeed[Setting up an on-premise deployment].
