= Manually scan the repository from GitHub

[role="_abstract"]
You can manually scan your Git repositories from GitHub if you did not set up a scanning schedule for your {AnsibleCodeBot} or if you do not want to wait for the next scheduled scan. 

If you manually scan your repository, and no pull request was created, it is likely so because a duplicate pull request already exists. 

.Procedure
. In GitHub, go to the main page of the repository that you want to scan.
. To modify the repository settings, click the *Settings* icon beside the *About* area. 
. In the *Topics* field, enter the keyword topic *ansible-code-bot-scan* to the repository. 
+
The following illustration shows the keyword topic for starting a manual scan:

+
. Click *Save changes*. 
+
Based on the repository webhook event, {AnsibleCodeBot} starts a manual scan of your repository.
If the avoid duplicate pull requests condition is not met, then the manual scan results in a new pull request with all the necessary {AnsibleCodeBot} recommendations.
