= Troubleshooting {LightspeedShortName} configuration errors

== Issue: Cannot access the Ansible Lightspeed administrator portal

The Ansible Lightspeed administrator portal can only be accessed by the Red Hat organization administrator.

If you are the Red Hat organization administrator, before you access the Ansible Lightspeed administrator portal, ensure that: 

* You have a valid {PlatformNameShort} subscription.
* Your organization has a valid {LightspeedShortName} subscription.

== Issue: Cannot upload the WCA key

When you enter the Watsonx Code Assistant (WCA) key, authentication fails and shows the following error message: 

`IBM Cloud API key is invalid`

{LightspeedShortName} verifies the WCA key by generating an associated access token. To resolve the error, ensure that you have not accidentally included any extra spaces when obtaining the WCA key from {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant}. If you still cannot upload the WCA key, contact IBM support. 

== Issue: Cannot configure the model ID due to authentication failure

When you enter the model ID in the {LightspeedShortName} administrator portal, the authentication fails. 

To resolve the error, ensure that: 

* You have configured a valid WCA key before you upload the model ID.
* You have not accidentally included any extra spaces when entering the model ID. 

== Issue: Cannot configure the model ID due to inference failure

While validating the model ID, {LightspeedShortName} performs a test inference. If {LightspeedShortName} detects an error, the validation fails and an `Inference failed` message is displayed. 

To resolve the error, ensure that: 

* You have a valid WCA key and model ID. 
* You have not accidentally included any extra spaces when obtaining the WCA key and model ID from {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant}.
