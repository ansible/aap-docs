+
To use the {LightspeedShortName} cloud service, you must meet *one* of the following requirements:

** Your organization has a trial or paid subscription to both the {PlatformName} and {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant}.
** Your organization has a trial or paid subscription to the {PlatformName}, and you have a {LightspeedShortName} trial account.
+

* *{LightspeedShortName} on-premise deployment*
+
To use an on-premise deployment of {LightspeedShortName}, your organization must have the following subscriptions:

** A trial or paid subscription to the {PlatformName} 

** An installation of {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} for {LightspeedshortName} on Cloud Pak for Data

== Setup requirements

To set up {LightspeedshortName} for your organization, you need the following {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} information:

* *API key*
+
A unique API key authenticates all requests made from {LightspeedShortName} to {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant}. Each Red Hat organization with a valid {PlatformNameShort} subscription must have a configured API key. When an authenticated {RHSSOshort} user creates a task request in {LightspeedShortName}, the API key associated with the user's Red Hat organization is used to authenticate the request to {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant}. 

* *Model ID*
+
A unique model ID identifies an {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} model in your IBM Cloud account. The model ID that you configure in the Ansible Lightspeed administrator portal is used as the default model, and can be accessed by all Ansible Lightspeed users within your organization. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must configure both the API key and the model ID when you are initially configuring {LightspeedShortName}.
