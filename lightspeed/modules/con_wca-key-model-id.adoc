= About the Watsonx Code Assistant key and model ID

You must have the following API keys to configure {LightspeedFullName}:

* Watsonx Code Assistant (WCA) key
+
A WCA key is an IBM Cloud key that authenticates all requests made from {LightspeedShortName} to {LightspeedShortName}. Each Red Hat organization with an Ansible Lightspeed subscription must have an associated, configured WCA key. When an authenticated {RHSSOshort} user creates a request in {LightspeedShortName}, the WCA key associated with the user's Red Hat organization is used to authenticate the request to {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant}. 

* Model ID
+
A model ID enables you to leverage a foundational machine learning model from {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} and make it available for your organization. {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} provides multiple models that you can access based on your {LightspeedShortName} subscription, and the model that you use depends on the model ID that you configure in Ansible Lightspeed for your organization.  
+
After a user request is authenticated using a WCA key, the request is routed to the model that is assigned for the user's organization. Ansible Lightspeed uses this model to understand the nuances of your organization's automation syntax and structure, and make code recommendations whenever best practices or quality improvement recommendations are available. 
 
You must configure both the WCA key and the model ID when you are initially configuring Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed. If you decide to eventually connect to a custom model instead of IBM watsonx Code Assistant's default foundation model, you must configure the model ID again.
