= Using the Ansible Lightspeed REST API 

[role="_abstract"]
As the platform administrator, you can configure and use the Ansible Lightspeed REST API to build a custom automation development and tooling workflow outside of VS Code. For information about the Ansible Lightspeed REST API, see link:https://developers.redhat.com/api-catalog/api/ansible-lightspeed[Ansible AI Connect. 1.0.0 (v1)] in the API catalog.
 
[NOTE]
====
The Ansible Lightspeed REST API is available for {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 and later.

.Prerequisite

* Ensure that you are using the {PlatformName} operator patch version 2.5-20250305.9 or later and {LightspeedShortName} operator version 2.5.250225 or later.

.Procedure

. Select the platform user for whom you want to grant REST API access. 
+
You can select an existing user or create a platform user in the {PlatformName}. For the procedure, see the link:{URLGettingStarted}/assembly-gs-platform-admin#proc-gs-platform-admin-create-user[Creating a user] section of _{TitleGettingStarted}_.

. Verify that you can log in to the Ansible Lightspeed portal for on-premise deployment (`\https://<lightspeed_route>/`) as the platform user you selected or created, and then log out.

. Create a token for the platform user:
.. Log in to the Ansible Lightspeed portal for on-premise deployment (`\https://<lightspeed_route>/admin`) as an administrator by using the following credentials:
+
* Username: *admin*
* Password: The secret that is named as `<lightspeed-custom-resource-name>-admin-password` in the {OCP} cluster namespace where {LightspeedShortName} is deployed. 

.. On the Django administration window, select *Users* from the Users area. A list of users is displayed.
.. Verify that the platform user is listed in the *Users* list.
.. From the Django Oauth toolkit area, select menu:Access tokens[Add].
.. Provide the following information and click *Save*:

* *User*: Use the magnifying glass icon to search and select the newly-created or existing user for whom you want to grant API access.
* *Token*: Specify a token for the user. Copy this token for later use.
* *Id token*: Select the token ID. 
* *Application*: Select *Ansible Lightspeed for VS Code*. 
* *Expires*: Select the date and time when you want the token to expire.  
* *Scope*: Specify the scope as *read write*. 
+
An access token is created for the user.

.. Log out from the Ansible Lightspeed portal for on-premise deployment.

. Make a direct call to the Ansible Lightspeed REST API by specifying the newly-created token in the authorization header:
