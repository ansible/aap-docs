= Key Features of {LightspeedShortName}

{LightspeedShortName} offers the following key features: 

* *Ansible-specific {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} foundation models*
+
{LightspeedFullName} leverages a specially trained, Ansible-specific IBM watsonx Granite model provided, managed, and maintained by IBM. IBM's watsonx Granite model offers the following benefits:

** More accurate recommendations.
** Lower training costs and streamlined, efficient GPU usage, allowing organizations to take a more sustainable approach.

* *Single tasks and multitask generation*
+
Using natural language prompts, you can generate single task or multiple task recommendations for Ansible task files and playbooks. To request multitask code recommendations, you can enter a sequence of natural language task prompts separated by ampersand (&) symbols.

* *Content source matching*
+
For each generated code recommendation, {LightspeedShortName} lists content source matches, including details like potential source, content author, and relevant licenses. You can use this data to gain insight into potential training data sources used to generate the code recommendations.

* *Post-processing capabilities*
+
{LightspeedShortName} offers post-processing capabilities that augment the {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} and improve the quality and accuracy of code recommendations. 
+
The Ansible code bot scans existing content collections, roles, and playbooks through git repositories, and proactively creates pull requests whenever best practices or quality improvement recommendations are available. The bot automatically submits pull requests to the repository, which proactively alerts the repository owner to a recommended change to their content.
