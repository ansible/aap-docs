= Resolving ansible-lint rule violations

[role="_abstract"]
If the {AnsibleContentParser} finds ansible-lint rule violations in your Ansible files, it is recommended that you fix the files with rule violations before uploading the training data set to {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant}. If you do not resolve the rule violations, the {AnsibleContentParser} excludes these files from the generated output.

.Procedure

* Use one of the following methods to resolve ansible-lint rule violations:

** Run the {AnsibleContentParser} with the  `--no-exclude` option
+
If any rule violations, including syntax-check errors, are found, the execution is aborted with an error and no training data set is created.

** Limit the set of rules that ansible-lint uses to scan your data with the `--profile` option
+
It is recommended that you fix the files with rule violations. However, if you do not want to modify the source files, you can limit the set of rules that ansible-lint uses to scan your data. 
To limit the set of rules that ansible-lint uses to scan your data, specify the `--profile` option with a predefined profile (for example, `min`, `basic`, `moderate`, `safety`, `shared`, or `production` profiles) or by using ansible-lint configuration files. For more information, see the link:https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/[Ansible Lint documentation]. 

** Run the {AnsibleContentParser} by skipping ansible-lint preprocessing
+
You can run the content parser without ansible-lint preprocessing. The {AnsibleContentParser} generates a training data set without scanning for ansible-lint rule violations. 
+
To run the {AnsibleContentParser} without ansible-lint preprocessing, execute the following command:
+
`$ ansible-content-parser _source_ _output_ _-S_`
+
Where:
+
*** `_source_`: Specifies the source of the training data set.
*** `_output_`: Specifies the output of the training data set.
*** `_-S_` or `_--skip-ansible-lint_`: Specifies to skip ansible-lint preprocessing while generating the training data set.
