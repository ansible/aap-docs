= About ansible-lint rule violations

By default, the {AnsibleContentParser} uses ansible-lint rules to scan your Ansible files and ensure that the content adheres to Ansible best practices. If rule violations are found, the {AnsibleContentParser} excludes these files from the generated output. In such scenarios, it is recommended that you fix the files with rule violations before uploading the training data set to {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant}. 

By default, ansible-lint applies the rules that are configured in `ansible-lint/src/ansiblelint/rules` while scanning your Ansible files. For more information about ansible-lint rules, see the link:https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/[Ansible Lint documentation].   

== How does the {AnsibleContentParser} handle rule violations?

* *Using autofixes*
+
The {AnsibleContentParser} runs ansible-lint with the `--fix=all` option to perform autofixes, which can fix or simplify fixing issues identified by that rule.
+
If ansible-lint identifies rule violations that have an associated autofix, it automatically fixes or simplifies the issues that violate the rules. If ansible-lint identifies rule violations that do not have an associated autofix, it reports these instances as rule violations which you must fix manually. 
For more information about autofixes, see link:https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/autofix/[Autofix] in Ansible Lint Documentation. 

* *Using syntax-checks*
+
Ansible-lint also performs syntax checks while scanning your Ansible files. If any syntax-check errors are found, ansible-lint stops processing the files. 
For more information about syntax-check errors, see link:https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/rules/syntax-check/[syntax-check] in Ansible Lint Documentation.
+
The {AnsibleContentParser} handles syntax-check rule violations in the following manner:

** If `syntax-check` errors are found in the first execution of ansible-lint, the {AnsibleContentParser} generates a list of files that contain the rule violations.

** If one or more `syntax-check` errors are found in the first execution of ansible-lint, the {AnsibleContentParser} runs ansible-lint again but excludes the files with syntax-check errors. After the scan is completed, the {AnsibleContentParser} generates a list of files that contain rule violations. The list includes all files that caused syntax-check errors as well as other rule violations.  The {AnsibleContentParser} excludes files with rule violations in all future scans, and the final training data set does not include data from the excluded files.
