= Creating an OAuth application

[role="_abstract"]
Use this procedure to create an OAuth application for your {LightspeedShortName} on-premise deployment. 

.Prerequisites
* You have an operational Ansible {ControllerName} instance.

.Procedure
. Log in to the {ControllerName} as an administrator.
. Under *Administration*, click menu:Applications[Add].
. Enter the following information:
.. *Name*: Specify a unique name for your application.
.. *Organization*: Select a preferred organization.
.. *Authorization grant type*: Select *Authorization code*.
.. *Redirect URIs*: Enter a temporary URL for now, for example, `https://temp/`.
+
The exact {LightspeedShortName} application URL is generated after the on-premise deployment is completed. After the deployment is completed, you must change the Redirect URI to point to the generated {LightspeedShortName} application URL. For more information, see xref:update-redirect-uri_configuring-lightspeed-onpremise[Updating the Redirect URIs].

.. From the *Client type* list, select *Confidential*.

. Click *Save*. 
+
A pop-up window is displayed along with the generated application client ID and client secret. 

. Copy and save both the generated client ID and client secret for future use.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
This is the only time the pop-up window is displayed. Therefore, ensure that you copy both the client ID and client secret, as you need these tokens to create connections secrets for {PlatformName} and {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} both.

The following image is an example of the generated client ID and client secret:
