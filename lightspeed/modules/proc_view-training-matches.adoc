= Viewing the Ansible Lightspeed training matches

[role="_abstract"]
The {LightspeedFullName} machine learning model is trained on the following content:

* Existing public or private Git repositories 

* Content from Ansible Galaxy

{ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} uses generative AI technology and various types of Ansible content to train the model. Therefore, it is not possible to trace the specific training data that produced a given code recommendation.

For each generated code recommendation, {LightspeedShortName} lists the content source matches, including details such as potential source, content author, and relevant licenses. You can use this data to gain insight into potential training data sources used to generate the code recommendations.

After you enter a natural language prompt in VS Code and see the generated code recommendations, you can view the content source matches on the *ANSIBLE: LIGHTSPEED TRAINING MATCHES* tab.

For example, the following illustration shows the training matches for the multitask recommendation *Install postgresql-server & run postgresql-setup command*:

This capability enables you to find out the open source license terms that are associated with related training data. However, it is unlikely that either the training data used in fine-tuning the code or the output recommendations themselves are protected by copyright, or that the output reproduces training data that is controlled by copyright licensing terms.
