= View Ansible Lightspeed training matches

The {LightspeedFullName} machine learning model is trained on content from {Galaxy} and the existing git repositories (both public and private) that you selected when installing the Ansible code bot.

Owing to {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant}'s generative AI technology, as well as the types of Ansible content that were used to train the model, it is not possible to identify the specific set of training data that contributed to the generated code recommendations. However, Ansible Lightspeed provides a capability that helps you to understand the possible origins of generated code recommendations. When the Ansible Lightspeed Service generates a code recommendation, it attempts to find items in the training dataset that closely match the recommendation. If matches are found, Ansible Lightspeed Service displays licensing information and a source repository link for the training data matches in the *Ansible Lightspeed Training Matches* tab in VS Code.

After you enter a natural language prompt in VS Code and see the generated code recommendations, you can view the content source matches on the *ANSIBLE: LIGHTSPEED TRAINING MATCHES* tab.

For example, the following illustration shows the training matches for the multitask recommendation "*Install ssh & Start the service*":

This capability enables you to find out the open source license terms that are associated with related training data. However, it is unlikely that either the training data used in fine-tuning the code or the output recommendations themselves are protected by copyright, or that the output reproduces training data that is controlled by copyright licensing terms.
