= Creating connection secrets

Use this procedure to create secrets to connect to {PlatformName} and {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant}.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed the {PlatformNameShort} operator on the {OCP}. 
* You have created an OAuth application in the {ControllerName}.
* You have obtained an API key and a model ID from {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant}. 
+
For information about obtaining an API key and model ID from {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant}, see the link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watsonx-code-assistant[{ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} documentation]. For information about installing {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} for {LightspeedshortName} on Cloud Pak for Data, see the link:https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSQNUZ_5.0.x/svc-welcome/wxca-ansible.html[watsonx Code Assistant for {LightspeedshortName} on Cloud Pak for Data documentation].

.Procedure
. Go to the {OCP}. 
. Select Select menu:Workloads[Secrets].
. Click *Create → Key/value secret*.
. From the *Projects* list, select the namespace that you created when you installed the {PlatformName} operator.
. Create an *authorization secret* to connect to the {PlatformName}:
.. Click *Create → Key/value secret*.
.. In *Secret name*, enter a unique name for the secret. For example, `auth-aiconnect`.
.. Add the following keys and their associated values individually:
+
[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
|Key |Value

|`auth_api_url`
|Enter the API URL of the {ControllerName} in the following format:
`https://<CONTROLLER_SERVER_NAME>/api`.

|`auth_api_key`
|Enter the client ID of the OAuth application that you recorded earlier.

|`auth_api_secret`
|Enter the client secret of the OAuth application that you recorded earlier.

|`auth_allowed_hosts`
|Enter the list of strings representing the host/domain names used by the underlying Django framework to restrict which hosts can access the service. This is a security measure to prevent HTTP Host header attacks. For more information, see link:https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts[Allowed hosts in django documentation]. 

|`auth_verify_ssl`
|Enter the value as `true`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that you do not accidentally add any whitespace characters (extra line, space, and so on) to the value fields. If there are any extra or erroneous characters in the secret, the connection to {PlatformName} fails.
====

.. Click *Create*.

. Similarly, create a *model secret* to connect to an {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} model:
.. Click *Create → Key/value secret*.
.. In *Secret name*, enter a unique name for the secret. For example, `model-aiconnect`.
.. Add the following keys and their associated values individually:
+
[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
|Key |Value

|`username`
|Enter the username you use to connect to an IBM Cloud Pak for Data deployment.

|`model_type`
|Enter `wca-onprem` to connect to an IBM Cloud Pak for Data deployment. 

|`model_url`
|Enter the URL to {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant}.

|`model_api_key`
|Enter the API key of your {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} model in your IBM Cloud Pak for Data deployment.

|`model_id`
|Enter the model ID of your {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} model in your IBM Cloud Pak for Data deployment.
