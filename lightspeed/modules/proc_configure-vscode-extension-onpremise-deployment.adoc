= Configuring Ansible VS Code extension for {LightspeedShortName} on-premise deployment

To access the on-premise deployment of {LightspeedShortName}, all Ansible users within your organization must install the Ansible Visual Studio (VS) Code extension in their VS Code editor, and configure the extension to connect to the on-premise deployment.

.Procedure

. Open the VS Code application.
. From the *Activity* bar, click the *Extensions* icon.
. From the *Installed Extensions* list, select *Ansible*.
. From the *Ansible* extension page, click the *Settings* icon (image:settings-icon-ansible-vscode-extension.png[Settings icon]) and select *Extension Settings*.
. Select *Ansible Lightspeed* settings and specify the following information:
* In the *URL for Ansible Lightspeed* field, enter the *Route URL* of the {LightspeedShortName} on-premise deployment. Ansible users must have {PlatformNameShort} controller credentials. 
* Optional: If you want to use a custom model instead of the default model, in the *Model ID Override* field, enter the custom model ID. Your settings are automatically saved in VS Code.
