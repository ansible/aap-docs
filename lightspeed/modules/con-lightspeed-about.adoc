= About {LightspeedShortName}

[role="_abstract"]
Using {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant}, {LightspeedShortName} accepts natural language prompts from users, and generates code recommendations for automation tasks whenever best practices or quality improvement recommendations are available. {LightspeedShortName} also proactively creates pull requests with code improvement recommendations for you to review, test, and apply in your Ansible content. 

{LightspeedShortName} is integrated with your existing Ansible developer workflows. You can use your existing git repositories (public and private) and {Galaxy} repositories as the data sources for training {LightspeedFullName} foundation models. You can access {LightspeedShortName} directly in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) using the Ansible VS Code extension. 

== Benefits of using {LightspeedShortName}
{LightspeedFullName} offers the following benefits: 

* *Reduces the onboarding learning period for Ansible developers*
+
With just a basic understanding of YAML syntax, Ansible developers can use natural language prompts to describe the automation goal for playbooks or tasks. {LightspeedShortName} then offers suggested Ansible code recommendations to help create the automation goal more efficiently. This combination of content and best practice suggestions reduces the onboarding learning period and offers a smoother onboarding experience for new Ansible users. 
+
For example, to get a multitask code recommendation, you can enter the prompt "create security group in us-east-2 & deploy m5.xlarge ec2 instance". The Ansible Lightspeed service reads the text, interacts with the {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} foundation model, and generates code recommendations to automate a multitask that creates a security group and deploys an Amazon EC2 M5 Instance. You can then view and accept the code recommendations to create tasks in an Ansible playbook. 

* *Increases productivity with quality content creation*
+
{LightspeedShortName} offers automation code recommendations that adhere to Ansible best practices, and provides the ability to fine tune the {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} foundation model to your organization's automation patterns. Therefore, the AI-generated code recommendations are more accurate, more reliable, and integrated with your existing automation development workflows. 

* *Improves automation code quality through user feedback*
+
{LightspeedShortName} integrates post-processing capabilities that augment model recommendations to ensure they adhere to recommended best practices. Ansible developers can provide feedback on the code suggestions, which is then used to improve the quality of code recommendations.
