. Select *Ansible Lightspeed* settings, and specify the following information:
.. Select the *Enable Ansible Lightspeed* checkbox.
.. In the *URL for Ansible Lightspeed* field, verify that you have the following URL: `\https://c.ai.ansible.redhat.com/`.
. Optional: If you want to use the custom model instead of the default model, in the *Model ID Override* field, enter the custom model ID. The *model-override* setting enables you to override the default model and use the custom model, after your organization administrator has created a custom model and has shared the model ID with you separately.
