= Configuring the Ansible VS Code extension

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure the Ansible VS Code extension to enable {LightspeedshortName} and specify it's portal URL and {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} model ID.

.Prerequisites

* Your organization administrator has configured an {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} model for your organization.

.Procedure

. Open the VS Code application.
. From the Activity bar, click the *Extensions* icon image:extensions-icon-vscode.png[Extensions].
. From the Installed Extensions list, select *Ansible*.
. From the *Ansible* extension page, click the *Settings* icon and select *Extension Settings*. 
. Select *Ansible Lightspeed* settings, and specify the following information:
.. Ensure that the *Enable Ansible Lightspeed with watsonx Code Assistant inline suggestions* checkbox is selected.
.. In the *URL for Ansible Lightspeed* field, verify that you have the following URL: `\https://c.ai.ansible.redhat.com/`. 
.. Select the *Enable Ansible Lightspeed with watsonx Code Assistant inline suggestions* checkbox.
. Optional: If you want to use the custom model instead of the default model, in the *Model ID Override* field, enter the custom model ID. The *model-override* setting enables you to override the default model and use the custom model, after your organization administrator has created a custom model and has shared the model ID with you separately. 
+
Your settings are automatically saved in VS Code.

If your organization recently subscribed to the {PlatformName}, it might take a few hours for {LightspeedShortName} to detect the new subscription. In VS Code, use the *Refresh* button in the Ansible extension from the Activity bar to check again.
