= Installing the {AnsibleCodeBot}

Install the {AnsibleCodeBot} to get code recommendations for your repositories, and then log in to the {AnsibleCodeBot} dashboard to monitor and manage your repository scans. 

.Procedure

. Log in to GitHub by using the account associated with your organization.
. Go to the link:https://github.com/apps/ansible-code-bot[{AnsibleCodeBot}] GitHub app. 
. Select the Ansible repositories that you want the app to access: 
* *All repositories*: Provides access to read the metadata of all repositories.
* *Only select repositories*: Provides access to read the metadata of only the repositories that you select. 
. Optional: If you selected *Only select repositories* in the previous step, select the repositories that you want the {AnsibleCodeBot} to access from the *Select repositories* list. 
. Click *Install & Authorize*. 
A message is displayed that specifies the following permissions are granted automatically to the bot during installation: 
* Read access to metadata
* Read and write access to code and pull requests
. When prompted, log in to your {RHSSO} account as an organization administrator. 
. Log in to the {AnsibleCodeBot} dashboard:
.. On the *Authorize Ansible code bot* page, verify your account and repository permissions. 
.. Click *Authorize Ansible*. 
+
From the *Authorize Ansible code bot* page, the following actions occur:
+
* {AnsibleCodeBot} verifies that you are a part of an organization that has an active subscription to {PlatformName}. 
* GitHub requests read permissions to access the repositories associated with your account.

On successful authorization, you are logged in to {AnsibleCodeBot} dashboard that displays all your repositories that have the {AnsibleCodeBot} installed along with their scan status. If you did not set up a scan schedule earlier, the dashboard displays the repositories without any associated scan history. You can scan your Git repository by starting a manual scan, or configure a schedule to scan your repository at regular intervals. You can also add a repository for scanning or remove an existing repository from being scanned. For more information, see xref:manage-repo-scans_using-code-bot-for-suggestions[Managing repository scans].
