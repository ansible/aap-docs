= Installing the {AnsibleCodeBot}

[role="_abstract"]
Install the {AnsibleCodeBot} to get code recommendations for your repositories, and then log in to the {AnsibleCodeBot} dashboard to monitor and manage your repository scans. 

.Procedure

. Log in to GitHub by using the account associated with your organization.
. Go to the link:https://github.com/apps/ansible-code-bot[{AnsibleCodeBot}] GitHub app. 
. Select the Ansible repositories that you want the app to access: 
* *All repositories*: Provides access to read the metadata of all repositories.
* *Only select repositories*: Provides access to read the metadata of only the repositories that you select. 
. Optional: If you selected *Only select repositories* in the previous step, select the repositories that you want the {AnsibleCodeBot} to access from the *Select repositories* list. 
. Click *Install & Authorize*. 
A message is displayed that specifies the following permissions are granted automatically to the bot during installation: 
* Read access to metadata
* Read and write access to code and pull requests
. When prompted, log in to your {RHSSO} account as an organization administrator. 
. Log in to the {AnsibleCodeBot} dashboard:
.. On the *Authorize {AnsibleCodeBot}* page, verify your account and repository permissions. 
.. Click *Authorize Ansible*. 
+
From the *Authorize {AnsibleCodeBot}* page, the following actions occur:
+
* {AnsibleCodeBot} verifies that you are a part of an organization that has an active subscription to {PlatformName}. 
* GitHub requests read permissions to access the repositories associated with your account.
+
On successful authorization, you are logged in to {AnsibleCodeBot} dashboard. The dashboard displays all your repositories that have the {AnsibleCodeBot} installed along with their scan status. 

.Verification

After the {AnsibleCodeBot} is installed, it automatically scans the selected repositories that are in Jinja format. When the scanning is complete, the code bot generates an initial PR for each repository; the initial PR also contains the scan schedule configured to run weekly.

Perform the following tasks:

. Review the initial PR for the suggested changes, and merge the PR.
+
After you merge the initial PR, the configured scan schedule is triggered, and the subsequent repository scans are performed weekly.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you do not merge the initial PR, the weekly scan schedule is not triggered and the {AnsibleCodeBot} dashboard displays the repositories without any associated scan history.

The following illustration is an example of an initial PR being created:

. Modify scanned repositories by xref:add-remove-repo-from-scans_using-code-bot-for-suggestions[adding repositories or removing existing repositories from being scanned].
