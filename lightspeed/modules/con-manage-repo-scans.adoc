= Managing repository scans

[role="_abstract"]

The {AnsibleCodeBot} dashboard displays a list of your repositories where the code bot is installed, and indicates if the scan schedule is not set, or is set to manual or scheduled scan. 

You can scan your Git repository by starting a manual scan, or configure a schedule to scan your repository at regular intervals. After the scan is completed, you can view the scan history. The scan history shows the start time, status, and type of scan. It also includes a link to the pull request if it was created, and the log message if the scan failed. You can also add new repositories for scanning or remove existing repositories from being scanned. 

== Manually scanning your Git repositories

You can manually scan your Git repositories if you did not set up a scanning schedule for your {AnsibleCodeBot} or if you do not want to wait for the next scheduled scan. If you manually scan your repository, and no pull request was created, it is likely so because a duplicate pull request already exists. You can scan your repository from both the {AnsibleCodeBot} dashboard and GitHub.
