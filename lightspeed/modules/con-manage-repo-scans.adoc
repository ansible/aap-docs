= Managing repository scans

[role="_abstract"]

The {AnsibleCodeBot} dashboard displays a list of your repositories where the code bot is installed, and indicates if the scan schedule is not set, or is set to manual or scheduled scan. 

You can scan your Git repository by starting a manual scan, or configure a schedule to scan your repository at regular intervals. After the scan is completed, you can view the scan history (start time, status, type of scan, link to the pull request if it was created, and the log message if the scan failed). You can also add new repositories for scanning or remove existing repositories from being scanned.
