= Creating roles and viewing role explanations 

You can create roles within Ansible collections using the Ansible VS Code extension. To create roles, use the Ansible VS Code extension, select the *Role Generation* option, and then enter the natural language prompts in English language. {LightspeedShortName} reads the natural language prompts and creates a role recommendation based on your intent. You can also view the explanations for new or existing roles. The role explanations describe what the role does and contextualize its impact.

These capabilities enable Ansible developers to use natural language prompts to create Ansible roles quickly and more efficiently, as well as get an explanation for existing Ansible roles. In addition to generating playbooks, role generation can now further reduce your team's overall onboarding learning period. For information about Ansible roles, see
