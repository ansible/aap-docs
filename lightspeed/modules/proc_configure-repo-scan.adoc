= Configure Ansible code bot to scan your repository at regular intervals

You can schedule the Ansible code bot to scan your repositories at daily, weekly, or monthly intervals. To specify the scan schedule, use the configuration file `ansible-lightspeed-bot.yml` that was created automatically when Ansible code bot was installed. 

.Procedure

. In Github, navigate to the configuration file in the repository that you want to scan.
. Create a `.yml` configuration file named `ansible-code-bot.yml` in your repository `.github` folder. For example, `.github/ansible-code-bot.yml`.
. In the configuration file, specify the `interval` parameter as follows:
----
schedule:
interval: "<daily | weekly | monthly>"
----
You can specify the `interval` as *daily*, *weekly*, or *monthly*.

. The frequency of the interval cadence is as follows:
.. Daily: Runs every day from Monday to Sunday.
.. Weekly: Runs once a week. By default, this is on Monday. 
.. Monthly: Runs on the first day of the month, once each month.
. Save your changes.

Ansible code bot starts scanning your repository per the schedule you configured at 9 am UTC time.
