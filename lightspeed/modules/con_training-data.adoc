= Data gathered to train the {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} models

== Models

{LightspeedFullName} uses Ansible-specific IBM watsonx Granite models unique to your organization. These models are provided, managed, and maintained by IBM.

== Data sources

{ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} models are trained on Ansible content from {Galaxy}, data from public Git repositories, and Red Hat Ansible subject matter expert examples. 

If you publish content to {Galaxy} and want to restrict your {Galaxy} content from being used to train the models, you can opt out of sharing your {Galaxy} data in the {Galaxy} namespace configuration. 

== Data telemetry

{LightspeedshortName} collects the following telemetry data by default:

* *Operational telemetry data*
+
This is the data that is required to operate and troubleshoot the Ansible Lightspeed service. For more information, refer the Enterprise Agreement. You cannot disable the collection of operational telemetry data. 

* *Admin dashboard telemetry data*
+
This is the data that provides insight into how your organization users are using the Ansible Lightspeed service, and the metrics are displayed on the Admin dashboard. You can also disable the Admin dashboard telemetry if you no longer want to collect and monitor the telemetry data. For more information about Admin dashboard telemetry, see xref:managing-admin-dashboard-telemetry_lightspeed-user-guide[Viewing and managing Admin dashboard telemetry].
