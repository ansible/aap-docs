= Removing seat licenses

[role="_abstract"]
You can remove users who no longer need to access {LightspeedShortName}, which makes licenses available for others to use. 

You can also remove seat licenses of deactivated RH-SSO users, so that they can no longer access {LightspeedShortName}. When RH-SSO users are deactivated, their {LightspeedShortName} seat licenses are not removed automatically. These users can continue accessing {LightspeedShortName} until the next time they are forced to reauthenticate with RH-SSO. To prevent deactivated RH-SSO users from accessing {LightspeedShortName}, you must remove their {LightspeedShortName} seat licenses.

[NOTE]
====
When you remove a user, the Ansible user's {LightspeedShortName} seat license only is removed; it does not remove the user from your Red Hat Customer Portal organization.
