= Merging multiple training data sets into a single file

For every execution, the {AnsibleContentParser} creates a training data set JSONL file named *ftdata.jsonl* that you upload to {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} for creating a custom model. If the {AnsibleContentParser} runs multiple times, multiple JSONL files are created. {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} supports a single JSONL file upload only; therefore, if you have multiple JSONL files, you must merge them into a single, concatenated file. You can also merge the multiple JSONL files that are generated in multiple subdirectories within a parent directory into a single file.

.Procedure 
. Using the command prompt, go to the parent directory.
. Run the following command to create a single, concatenated file: +
`find . -name ftdata.json | xargs cat > concatenated.json`
. Optional: Rename the concatenated file for easy identification. 

You can now upload the merged JSONL file to {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} and create a custom model.
