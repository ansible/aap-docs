= Installing the {AnsibleContentParser}

[role="_abstract"]
Install the {AnsibleContentParser}, a command-line interface (CLI) tool, on your computer. 

.Prerequisites

Ensure that your computer has one of the following supported OS:

* Python version 3.10 or later.  
* UNIX OS, such as Linux or Mac OS.  
+
[NOTE]
====
Installation of the {AnsibleContentParser} on Microsoft Windows OS is not supported.
====

.Procedure

. Create a working directory and set up `venv` Python virtual environment:
+
`$ python -m venv ./venv`
+
`$ source ./venv/bin/activate`

. Install the latest version of the {AnsibleContentParser} from the `pip` repository:
+
`$ pip install --upgrade pip`
+
`$ pip install --upgrade ansible-content-parser`

. Perform one of the following tasks:
** To generate a training data set without ansible-lint preprocessing, see section xref:generate-training-data-set_administering-ansible-lightspeed[Generating a custom model training data set]. 
** To generate a training data set with ansible-lint preprocessing, ensure that you have the latest version of ansible-lint installed on your computer:
... View the ansible-lint versions that are installed on your computer.
+
`$ ansible-content-parser --version`
+
`$ ansible-lint --version`
+
A list of application versions and their dependencies are displayed.

... In the output, verify that the version of ansible-lint that was installed with the {AnsibleContentParser} is the same as that of the previously-installed ansible-lint. A mismatch in the installed ansible-lint versions causes inconsistent results from the {AnsibleContentParser} and ansible-lint.
+
For example, in the following output, the {AnsibleContentParser} installation includes ansible-lint version 6.20.0 which is a mismatch from previously-installed ansible-lint version 6.13.1:
+
----
$ ansible-content-parser --version
ansible-content-parser 0.0.1 using ansible-lint:6.20.0 ansible-core:2.15.4
$ ansible-lint --version
ansible-lint 6.13.1 using ansible 2.15.4
A new release of ansible-lint is available: 6.13.1 → 6.20.0
----

... If there is a mismatch in the ansible-lint versions, deactivate and reactivate `venv` Python virtual environment: 
+
`$ deactivate`
+
`$ source ./venv/bin/activate`

... Verify that the version of ansible-lint that is installed with the {AnsibleContentParser} is the same as that of the previously-installed ansible-lint: 
+
`$ ansible-content-parser --version`
+
`$ ansible-lint --version`
+
For example, the following output shows that both ansible-lint installations on your computer are of version 6.20.0:
+
----
$ ansible-content-parser --version
ansible-content-parser 0.0.1 using ansible-lint:6.20.0 ansible-core:2.15.4
$ ansible-lint --version
ansible-lint 6.20.0 using ansible-core:2.15.4 
ansible-compat:4.1.10 ruamel-yaml:0.17.32 ruamel-yaml-clib:0.2.7
