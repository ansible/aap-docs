= Configuring {LightspeedshortName} to use custom models

After you create and deploy a custom model in {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant}, you must configure {LightspeedshortName} so that you can use the custom model for your organization. 

You can specify one of the following configurations for using the custom model:

* *Enable access for all users in your organization*
+
You can configure the custom model as the default model for your organization. All users in your organization who have a {LightspeedshortName} seat assigned can use the custom model. 

* *Enable access for select Ansible users in your organization*
+
Using the *model-override* setting, you can configure the custom model and make it available for select Ansible users only. For example, if you are using {LightspeedshortName} both as an organization administrator and an end user, you can test the custom model for select Ansible users before making it available for all users in your organization. 

== Configuring the custom model for all Ansible users in your organization

You can configure the custom model as the default model for your organization, so that all users in your organization can use the custom model.
