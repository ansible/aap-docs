= Updating connection secrets on an existing {PlatformName} operator

After you have set up the {LightspeedShortName} on-premise deployment successfully, you can modify the deployment if you want to connect to another {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} model. For example, you connected to the default {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} model but now want to connect to a custom model instead. To connect to another {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} model, you must create new connection secrets, and then update the connection secrets and parameters on an existing {PlatformName} operator.

.Prerequisites
* You have set up a {LightspeedShortName} on-premise deployment. 
* You have obtained an API key and a model ID of the {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} model you want to connect to. 
* You have created new authorization and model connection secrets for the {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} model that you want to connect to. For information about creating authorization and model connection secrets, see xref:create-connection-secrets_configuring-lightspeed-onpremise[Creating connection secrets].

.Procedure
. Go to the {OCP}. 
. Select menu:Operators[Installed Operators].
. From the *Projects* list, select the namespace where you installed the {LightspeedShortName} instance.
. Locate and select the *Ansible Automation Platform (provided by Red Hat)* operator that you installed earlier.
. Select the *Ansible Lightspeed* tab.
. Find and select the instance you want to update.
. Click menu:Actions[Edit AnsibleLightspeed]. The editor switches to a text or YAML view.
. Scroll the text to find the `spec:` section.
