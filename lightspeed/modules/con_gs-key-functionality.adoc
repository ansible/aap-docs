{LightspeedFullName} is a generative AI service that helps automation teams create, adopt, and maintain Ansible content more efficiently. It uses natural language prompts to generate code recommendations for automation tasks based on Ansible best practices.

The following illustration provides information about the components of the Ansible Lightspeed Service:

The Ansible Lightspeed service consists of three components:

* The *developer interface* is built natively into the VS Code extension via the Ansible extension, which allows Ansible content creators to use natural language prompts in the Ansible Playbooks or task files to generate Ansible Lightspeed single- and multi-task suggestions.

* The *integrated service* acts as the glue or broker between the developer interface and the watsonx.ai service. It brings the power of AI to {PlatformNameShort} and enhances the responses from the AI with its post-processing capabilities.

* The *AI* - {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} provides access to Ansible-specific watsonx.ai foundation model that generates Ansible content recommendations.

== Deployment models
{LightspeedFullName} can be deployed as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) deployment or on-premise in your data center. It is also available as a free 90-day trial for existing Ansible users, without requiring a trial or paid subscription to {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant}.
