= Viewing the generated training data set

After the {AnsibleContentParser} scans your Ansible files, it generates the training data set in an output directory. The training data set includes a *ftdata.jsonl* file, which is the main output of the {AnsibleContentParser}. The file is available in JSON Lines file format, where each line entry represents a JSON object. You must upload this JSONL file to {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} to create a custom model. 

.Result

The generated output directory has the following file structure: 
----
output/
  |-- ftdata.jsonl  # Training dataset
  |-- report.txt   # A human-readable report
  |
  |-- repository/
  |     |-- (files copied from the source repository)
  |
  |-- metadata/ 
        |-- (metadata files generated during the execution)
----

Where:

* *ftdata.jsonl*: A training data set file, which is the main output of the {AnsibleContentParser}. The file is available in JSON Lines files format, where each line entry represents a JSON object. You must upload this JSONL file in {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} to create a custom model.
* *report.txt*: A human-readable text file that provides a summary of all {AnsibleContentParser} executions.
* *repository*: A directory that contains files from the source repository. Sometimes, ansible-lint updates the directory according to the configured rules, so the file contents of the output directory might differ from the source repository.
* *metadata*: A directory that contains multiple metadata files that are generated during each {AnsibleContentParser} execution.

.Next steps
You can use the *report.txt* file to resolve ansible-lint rule violations. The *report.txt* file contains the following information:

* File counts per type: A list of files according to their file types, such as playbooks, tasks, handlers, and jinja2. 
* List of Ansible files that were identified: A list of files identified by ansible-lint with a file name, a file type, and whether the file was excluded from further processing, or automatically fixed by ansible-lint.
* List of Ansible modules found in tasks: A list of modules identified by ansible-lint with a module name, a module type, and whether the file was excluded from further processing, or automatically fixed by ansible-lint.
* Issues found by ansible-lint: A list of issues along with a brief summary of ansible-lint execution results. If ansible-lint encounters files with syntax-check errors in the first execution, then it initiates a second execution and excludes the files with errors from the scan. You can use this information to resolve ansible-lint rule violations.
