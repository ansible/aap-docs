= Overview

[role="_abstract"]
This section provides information about the system requirements, prerequisites, and the process for setting up a {LightspeedshortName} on-premise deployment.

== Deployment models
You can use one of the following modes of deployment:

* *On-premise deployment*
+
Both {LightspeedShortName} and the {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} model (IBM Cloud Pak for Data) are on-premise deployments. Telemetry data is not collected for an on-premise mode of deployment. 

* *Hybrid deployment*
+
{LightspeedShortName} is an on-premise deployment, while {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} model is a cloud deployment. Telemetry data is not collected for hybrid deployments. 
+
A hybrid deployment model provides the following benefits:

** Enables you to set up an on-premise deployment of {LightspeedShortName}, with  {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} model on a cloud environment. 

** Provides the freedom and flexibility to choose an environment that best suits your organizational needs.

** Enables organizations to use the {PlatformNameShort} for user authentication, instead of logging into the Red Hat cloud.

** Enables organizations to deploy the {PlatformNameShort} in their preferred region.

== System requirements

Your system must meet the following minimum system requirements to install and run the {LightspeedshortName} on-premise deployment.

[NOTE]
====
You must also have installed {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} for {LightspeedshortName} on Cloud Pak for Data. The installation includes a base model that you can use to set up your {LightspeedshortName} on-premise deployment. For installation information, see the link:https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/software-hub/5.1.x?topic=services-watsonx-code-assistant-red-hat-ansible-lightspeed[watsonx Code Assistant for {LightspeedshortName} on Cloud Pak for Data documentation]. 
====

== Prerequisites

* You have installed {PlatformName} on your {OCP} environment.

* You have administrator privileges for {PlatformName}.

* You have installed {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} for {LightspeedshortName} on Cloud Pak for Data.

* Your system meets the minimum system requirements to set up {LightspeedshortName} on-premise deployment.

* You have obtained an API key and a model ID from {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant}.
