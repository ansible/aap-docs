= Configuring {LightspeedshortName} to use custom models

[role="_abstract"]
After you create and deploy a custom model in {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant}, you must configure {LightspeedshortName} so that you can use the custom model for your organization. 

You can specify one of the following configurations for using the custom model:

* *Enable access for all users in your organization*
+
You can configure a custom model as the default model for your organization. All users in your organization can use the custom model. 

* *Enable access for select Ansible users in your organization*
+
Using the *model-override* setting in the Ansible VS Code extension, select Ansible users can tune their Ansible Lightspeed service to use a custom model instead of the default model. For example, If you are using {LightspeedshortName} as both an organization administrator and an end user, you can test the custom model for select Ansible users before making it available for all users in your organization.
