= Manually scan your Git repositories

You can manually scan your Git repositories if you did not set up a scanning schedule for your {AnsibleCodeBot} or if you do not want to wait for the next scheduled scan.

If the avoid duplicate PRs condition is not met, then a manual scan results in a new PR with all the necessary Ansible code bot recommendations.

Following are the avoid duplicate conditions: 

* Verify that the {AnsibleCodeBot} pull request (PR) already exists, and is on the latest commit main branch. If this condition is met, you can skip the scan.
* If there is an existing PR but it is not on the latest commit branch, the Ansible code bot takes a PR difference. If there is no difference, then the bot skips pushing the scan results as a new pull request.

.Procedure

. In GitHub, go to the main page of the repository that you want to scan.
. Click the *Settings* icon.
. In the *Topics* field, enter the keyword topic *ansible-code-bot-scan* to the repository. 
+
The following illustration shows the keyword topic for starting a manual scan:

+
. Click *Save changes*. 
+
Based on the repository webhook event, {AnsibleCodeBot} starts a manual scan of your repository.
If the avoid duplicate pull requests condition is not met, then the manual scan results in a new pull request with all the necessary Ansible code bot recommendations.
