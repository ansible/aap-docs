. Click *Save changes*.

Based on the repository webhook event, Ansible code bot starts a manual scan of your repository.
If the avoid duplicate pull requests condition is not met, then the manual scan results in a new pull request with all the necessary Ansible code bot recommendations. 

BOT avoid duplicate condition:

* Verify that the Ansible Lightspeed bot pull request already exists, and is on the latest commit main branch. If this is true, you can skip the scan directly.
* If there is a pull request that is present and not on the latest commit branch, the bot takes a pull request diff. If there is no diff then the bot skips pushing the scan results as a new pull request.
