= Best practices to generate playbooks 

Follow these guidelines to improve the likelihood of a quality playbook recommendation.

* Ensure that the goal statements directly specify what the playbook must do.
+
Your statement should start with the goal of the playbook, for example, `Apply security patches to RHEL9`. Avoid starting statements with `Create a playbook that`, `Please prepare a playbook that`, or `I need help with`. 

* Ensure that the goal statement does not contain new lines.

* Ensure that the goal statement is not more than one sentence.
+
You might have to repeat the details in the goal statement to produce the best results. It is recommended that you use the generated outline as feedback about whether your goal statement might benefit from more or less details, and then modify the goal statement as necessary.  

* Ensure the following when you edit the outline:

** Do not restate the goal of the playbook.

** Verify that the steps considered capture the key steps in the playbook. The steps need not reflect each and every task that is expected in the playbook.

** Keep the step description in one sentence without adding new lines to the outline.
