= Logging in to Ansible Lightspeed through the Ansible VS Code extension

After installing and configuring the VS Code extension, you can log in to the Ansible Lightspeed service.

== Sign-in options

{LightspeedShortName} provides different sign-in methods depending on whether you are using the cloud service or the on-premise deployment.

* *Ansible Lightspeed on-premise deployments*
+
Users are authenticated using your {PlatformName} login. 
+
To sign in, you can use the *Connect* button in the Ansible Lightspeed view, or the *Sign in with Ansible Lightspeed to use Ansible* option in the *Accounts* menu. Once prompted in the browser, select *Log in with Ansible Automation Platform*, and log in with the authorization mechanism that your automation controller is configured with. 

* *Ansible Lightspeed cloud service*
+
Users are authenticated using {RHSSO} ({RHSSOshort}).
+
To sign in from VS Code, you can use the *Connect* button in the Ansible Lightspeed view, or the *Sign in with Ansible Lightspeed to use Ansible* option in the *Accounts* menu. Follow the on-screen prompts to log in and access the Ansible Lightspeed service using your ({RHSSOshort}).

+
[NOTE]
+
====
If you are using a cloud development environment at a domain unknown by Ansible Lightspeed, such as on-premise Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces, your *Accounts* sign-in menu provides the option *Sign-in with Red Hat to use Ansible*. This option uses a device code flow to successfully complete the sign-in process and requires the Red Hat Authentication extension v0.2.0 or later. If you require this authentication flow but don't see the *Sign-in with Red Hat to use Ansible* option, ensure you are using the Ansible VS Code extension v24.5.2 or later.
