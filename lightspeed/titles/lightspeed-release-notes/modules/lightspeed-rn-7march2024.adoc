This release includes several enhancements, additions, and fixes that have been implemented in {LightspeedShortName}.

== New features and enhancements 

* *Availability of {AnsibleCodeBot} Technology Preview as a General Availability release*
+
Previously, {LightspeedShortName} provided the {AnsibleCodeBot} as a Technology Preview release. Now the {AnsibleCodeBot} is available as General Availability release along with improved performance and an {AnsibleCodeBot} dashboard. 
+
The dashboard displays a list of your repositories where the code bot is installed, and indicates if the scan schedule is not set, or is set to manual or scheduled scan. From the dashboard, you can start a manual scan, view the scan history, and view the repository. 
+

* *Ability to collect and manage the Admin dashboard telemetry*
+
{LightspeedShortName} now collects Admin dashboard telemetry data that provides insight into how your organization users are using the Ansible Lightspeed service, and displays the metrics on the Admin dashboard. If you no longer want to collect and manage the Admin dashboard telemetry, you can disable it for your organization.
