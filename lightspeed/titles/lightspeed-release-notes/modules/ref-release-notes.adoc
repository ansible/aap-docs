[role="_abstract"]
The release notes for {LightspeedFullName} summarize all new features, enhancements, and any known bugs. 

== 30 July 2025
This release features the following enhancement:

*Ability to enable or disable PII anonymization on Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed on-premise deployments*

Organization administrators can now enable or disable Personally Identifiable Information (PII) anonymization on {LightspeedShortName} on-premise deployments by using the `model_enable_anonymization key`. PII includes passwords, IP addresses, email addresses, and other sensitive data. When PII anonymization is enabled, users' personal information is modified to some generic values to protect their data and reduce the risk of data leaks. 

For information about enabling or disabling PII anonymization, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_lightspeed_with_ibm_watsonx_code_assistant/2.x_latest/html/red_hat_ansible_lightspeed_with_ibm_watsonx_code_assistant_user_guide/set-up-lightspeed_lightspeed-user-guide#create-connection-secrets_configuring-lightspeed-onpremise[Creating connection secrets].

== 29 May 2025
This release features the following enhancement: 

*Availability of the hybrid deployment model*

{LightspeedShortName} now supports a hybrid deployment model, wherein Ansible administrators can configure {LightspeedShortName} on-premise deployment with a cloud deployment of the {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} model. 

This new offering provides the following benefits:

* Enables you to set up an on-premise deployment of {LightspeedShortName}, with an option to use an {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} model that is on either an on-premise environment or a cloud environment. 

* Provides the freedom and flexibility to choose an environment that best suits your organizational needs.

* Enables organizations to use the {PlatformNameShort} for user authentication, instead of logging into the Red Hat cloud.

* Enables organizations to deploy the {PlatformNameShort} in their preferred region.

For information on setting up an on-premise or hybrid deployment model, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_lightspeed_with_ibm_watsonx_code_assistant/2.x_latest/html/red_hat_ansible_lightspeed_with_ibm_watsonx_code_assistant_user_guide/set-up-lightspeed_lightspeed-user-guide#configuring-lightspeed-onpremise_set-up-lightspeed[Setting up {LightspeedShortName} on-premise deployment].

== 28 April 2025

This release features the following enhancement: 

*Ability to view audit logs*

The Ansible Visual Studio (VS Code) extension now records all {LightspeedShortName} operations in an audit log for future use. Each interaction is recorded with a timestamp, the type of action performed, details of the requested task, and other relevant information. The logs are displayed in the Ansible Lightspeed Output Channel of the VS Code editor and are available until the user closes VS Code.

For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_lightspeed_with_ibm_watsonx_code_assistant/2.x_latest/html-single/red_hat_ansible_lightspeed_with_ibm_watsonx_code_assistant_user_guide/index#view-logs_developing-ansible-content[Viewing the audit logs].

+
{LightspeedShortName} is now available for on-premise deployments. This capability provides the {PlatformName} customers more control over their data and supports compliance with enterprise security policies. For example, organizations in sensitive industries with data privacy or air-gapped requirements can use on-premise deployments of both {LightspeedShortName} and {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} for {LightspeedShortName} on Cloud Pak for Data. {LightspeedShortName} on-premise deployments are supported on {PlatformName} version 2.4. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_lightspeed_with_ibm_watsonx_code_assistant/2.x_latest/html-single/red_hat_ansible_lightspeed_with_ibm_watsonx_code_assistant_user_guide/index#configuring-lightspeed-onpremise_set-up-lightspeed[Setting up Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed on-premise deployment].

[NOTE]
====
The following capabilities are not yet available on {LightspeedShortName} on-premise deployments:

* Viewing telemetry data on the Admin dashboard
* Generating playbooks and viewing playbook explanations
====

* *Playbook generation and explanations*
+
Using the Ansible VS Code extension, you can create Ansible playbooks using a natural language interface in English. {LightspeedShortName} with {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} reads the natural language prompts and generates an entire playbook recommendation based on your intent. You can also view the explanations for new or existing playbooks. The playbook explanations describe what the playbook or task within the playbook does and contextualize its impact. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_lightspeed_with_ibm_watsonx_code_assistant/2.x_latest/html-single/red_hat_ansible_lightspeed_with_ibm_watsonx_code_assistant_user_guide/index#playbook-generation_developing-ansible-content[Creating playbooks and viewing playbook explanations].

== 7 March 2024

This release features the following enhancements: 

* *{AnsibleCodeBot} General Availability*
+
Previously, {LightspeedShortName} provided the {AnsibleCodeBot} as a Technology Preview release. Now, the {AnsibleCodeBot} is available as General Availability release along with an improved performance and an {AnsibleCodeBot} dashboard. 
+
The dashboard displays a list of your repositories where the code bot is installed, the status of your repository scans, and indicates whether the scan schedule is not set, or is set to manual or scheduled scan. From the dashboard, you can start a manual scan, view the scan history, and view the repository. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_lightspeed_with_ibm_watsonx_code_assistant/2.x_latest/html-single/red_hat_ansible_lightspeed_with_ibm_watsonx_code_assistant_user_guide/index#using-code-bot-for-suggestions_lightspeed-user-guide[Installing and configuring the Ansible code bot].

* *Ability to collect and manage the Admin dashboard telemetry*
+
{LightspeedShortName} now collects Admin dashboard telemetry data that provides insight into how your organization users are using the Ansible Lightspeed service, and displays the metrics on the Admin dashboard. If you no longer want to collect and manage the Admin dashboard telemetry, you can disable it for your organization. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_lightspeed_with_ibm_watsonx_code_assistant/2.x_latest/html-single/red_hat_ansible_lightspeed_with_ibm_watsonx_code_assistant_user_guide/index#view-manage-admin-dashboard-telemetry_administering-ansible-lightspeed[Viewing and managing Admin dashboard telemetry].

== 15 February 2024

This release features the following enhancements: 

* *Model customization*
+
Organization administrators can now create and use fine-tuned, custom models that are trained on your organization's existing Ansible content. With this capability, you can tune the models to your organization's automation patterns and improve the code recommendation experience. 
+
You can configure multiple custom models for your organization. For example, you can create a custom model for your corporate IT automation team and a different one for your engineering team's infrastructure. You can also configure a custom model to make it available for all Ansible users or select Ansible users in your organization. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_lightspeed_with_ibm_watsonx_code_assistant/2.x_latest/html-single/red_hat_ansible_lightspeed_with_ibm_watsonx_code_assistant_user_guide/index#configure-custom-models_administering-ansible-lightspeed[Configuring custom models].

* *Streamlined the setup process*
+
Previously, organization administrators had to assign seat licenses to users so that they could access {LightspeedShortName}. With the new subscription plans from {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant}, organization administrators no longer need to manage access to {LightspeedShortName} by assigning or removing seat licenses.

== 25 October 2023

The following components are available for using {LightspeedShortName}:

* Ansible Extension for VS Code v2.8.108
* {AnsibleCodeBot} Technology Preview

This release includes the following features:

* *Post-processing capabilities*
+
{LightspeedShortName} offers post-processing capabilities that augment {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} and improve the quality and accuracy of code recommendations. 

* *Content modernization*
