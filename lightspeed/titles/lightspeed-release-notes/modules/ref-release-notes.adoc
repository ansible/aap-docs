[role="_abstract"]
The release notes for {LightspeedFullName} summarize all new features, enhancements, and any known bugs. 

== 19 December 2025

This release features the following enhancement:

*Support for Bring Your Own LLM (BYOLLM) providers*

The {LightspeedShortName} extension for {VSCode} now includes Bring-Your-Own-LLM (BYOLLM) functionality, decoupling the code generation experience from a single model provider ({ibmwatsonxcodeassistant}).

Ansible users can now configure and select their preferred third-party Large Language Model (LLM), such as Google Gemini or custom {OpenAI}-compliant models, rather than relying exclusively on the default {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} (WCA). By allowing users to switch providers, Ansible developers can use the most current and capable AI models to create single or multitask recommendations, generate and explain playbooks and roles. This capability ensures high-quality outputs and improved accuracy without disrupting established development workflows.

[NOTE]
====
{LightspeedShortName} no longer supports custom model creation. 
====

For information about how to configure Google Gemini or {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} as the AI provider, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_lightspeed_with_ibm_watsonx_code_assistant/2.x_latest/html-single/red_hat_ansible_lightspeed_with_ibm_watsonx_code_assistant_user_guide/index#configure-vscode-extension_developing-ansible-content[Configuring the Ansible {VSCode} extension].

* Enhancement

** Support for {LightspeedShortName} on-premise deployment on {PlatformNameShort} 2.6 
+
{LightspeedShortName} is now available for on-premise deployment on {PlatformNameShort} 2.6. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_lightspeed_with_ibm_watsonx_code_assistant/2.x_latest/html/red_hat_ansible_lightspeed_with_ibm_watsonx_code_assistant_user_guide/set-up-lightspeed_lightspeed-user-guide#configuring-lightspeed-onpremise_set-up-lightspeed[Setting up {PlatformNameShort} on-premise deployment].

* Deprecated feature

** The Ansible code bot (as described in chapter link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_lightspeed_with_ibm_watsonx_code_assistant/2.x_latest/html/red_hat_ansible_lightspeed_with_ibm_watsonx_code_assistant_user_guide/using-code-bot-for-suggestions_lightspeed-user-guide[Installing and configuring the Ansible code bot]) is being deprecated, and will be retired on December 31, 2025.

* Known issue

** If you have an existing deployment of Ansible Lightspeed on {PlatformNameShort} 2.5, upgrading to {PlatformNameShort} 2.6 will cause your Ansible Lightspeed on-premise deployment to fail. To avoid this failure, do not upgrade to {PlatformNameShort} 2.6 until a forthcoming patch is released on October 22, 2025. However, new deployments of Ansible Lightspeed will work correctly on {PlatformNameShort} 2.6. (AAP-54064). For more information, see the Knowledgebase article link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7132132[Ansible Lightspeed upgrade fails when upgrading Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 to 2.6].
