This release {LightspeedShortName} features the following enhancement: 

* *Availability of the hybrid deployment model*
+
{LightspeedShortName} now supports a hybrid deployment model, wherein Ansible administrators can configure {LightspeedShortName} on-premise deployment with a cloud deployment of the {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} model. 
+
This new offering provides the following benefits:

** Enables you to set up an on-premise deployment of {LightspeedShortName}, with an option to use an {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} model that is on either an on-premise environment or a cloud environment. 

** Provides the freedom and flexibility to choose an environment that best suits your organizational needs.

** Enables organizations to use the {PlatformNameShort} for user authentication, instead of logging into the Red Hat cloud.

** Enables organizations to deploy the {PlatformNameShort} in their preferred region.

+
