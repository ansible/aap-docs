{LightspeedShortName} cloud service provides a free 90-day trial for existing Ansible users. To start a free trial, you need a trial or paid subscription to the {PlatformName}, but you do not need a trial or paid subscription to {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant}. This means that you do not need to configure the API key or model ID when setting up a trial account. Using the trial account, you can create single-task and multitask recommendations, generate playbooks, and view playbook explanations.
