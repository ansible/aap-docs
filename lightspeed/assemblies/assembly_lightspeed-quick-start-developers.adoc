This section shows how to get started with {LightspeedShortName} as a developer.

{LightspeedShortName} simplifies writing and managing infrastructure as code with intuitive automation and integrations, enabling fast, efficient coding. Developers can focus on applications, not infrastructure management, due to its simplified workflows.

After the organization administrators have set up {LightspeedShortName}, automation developers can use the Ansible Lightspeed service to develop and use custom automation content.

Perform the following tasks to develop Ansible content:

* Install and configure the Ansible {VSCode} extension
* Develop Ansible content

== Install and configuring Ansible {VSCode} extension
To access {LightspeedShortName}, all Ansible users must install and configure the Ansible {VSCode} extension in their {VSCode} editor. For the procedure, see xref:installing-ansible-vscode-extension_lightspeed-user-guide[Install and configure the Ansible {VSCode} extension]. 

== Develop Ansible content
After installing and configuring the Ansible {VSCode} extension, developers can create custom Ansible content. 

You can perform the following tasks:

* Start a free 90-day trial of {LightspeedShortName}
+
This is especially useful as you *do not need* a trial or paid subscription to {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant}. After your 90-day trial expires, you must set up the cloud service or on-premise deployment to continue accessing the Ansible Lightspeed service.

* Create single-task or multitask code recommendations
+
You can generate single-task or multitask code recommendations for your task intent using the Ansible {VSCode} extension.

* Create Ansible playbooks and view playbook explanations
+
You can create Ansible playbooks and view explanations for new or existing playbooks by using the Ansible {VSCode} extension.

* Create roles within a collection and view role explanations
+
You can generate roles within collections using the Ansible {VSCode} extension and view explanations for existing roles.
