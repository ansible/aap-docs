= Configure the {AnsibleCodeBot} to scan your repository at regular intervals

:context: configuring-repository-scans

[role="_abstract"]
After installing the {AnsibleCodeBot}, it automatically scans the selected repositories that are in Jinja format. Once the scanning is complete, the code bot generates an initial PR for each repository; the initial PR also contains the scan schedule configured to run weekly. 

You must review the initial PR for the suggested changes and merge the PR. Once the initial PR is merged, the scan schedule is triggered, and the subsequent repository scans are performed weekly. If required, you can change the scan schedule to a daily or monthly cadence. 

[NOTE]
====
If you do not merge the initial PR, the weekly scan schedule is not triggered and the {AnsibleCodeBot} dashboard displays the repositories without any associated scan history.  In such a scenario, you must manually create a configuration file `ansible-code-bot.yml` and specify your scan schedule within the file.
