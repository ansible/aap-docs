:context: logging-in-admin-portal

[role="_abstract"]
Ansible users can use [lightspeedshortname] after the organization administrator has assigned them seat licenses. You access Ansible Lightspeed through the Ansible Lightspeed portal. [lightspeedshortname] uses Red Hat Single Sign On (SSO) for authentication, and verifies that you have an assigned seat license. After you log in to the Ansible Lightspeed portal, your assigned user role is displayed on the login screen.
