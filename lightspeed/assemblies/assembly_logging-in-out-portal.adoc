[role="_abstract"]
Ansible users can use {LightspeedShortName} after the organization administrator has assigned them seat licenses. You access Ansible Lightspeed through the Ansible Lightspeed portal. {LightspeedShortName} uses {RHSSO} ({RHSSOshort}) for authentication, and verifies that you have an assigned seat license. After you log in to the Ansible Lightspeed portal, your assigned user role is displayed on the login screen.
