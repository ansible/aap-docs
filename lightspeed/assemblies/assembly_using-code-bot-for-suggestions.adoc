[role="_abstract"]
{AnsibleCodeBot} scans GitHub repositories (collections, roles, playbooks) and proactively creates pull requests with best practice or quality improvement recommendations.

{AnsibleCodeBot} scans your code repositories to recommend code quality improvements. It promotes Ansible best practices while avoiding common errors that can lead to bugs or make code harder to maintain. The bot automatically submits pull requests to the repository, which proactively alerts the repository owner to a recommended change to their content. You can configure {AnsibleCodeBot} to scan your existing Git repositories (both public and private). 

[NOTE]
====
Your organization must have an active subscription to {PlatformName} to use the {AnsibleCodeBot}. However, {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} is not required to use the {AnsibleCodeBot}.
====

After the {AnsibleCodeBot} is installed, it automatically scans the selected repositories that are in Jinja format. Once the scanning is complete, the code bot generates an initial PR for each repository; the initial PR also contains the scan schedule configured to run weekly. You must review the initial PR for the suggested changes and merge the PR. Once the initial PR is merged, the scan schedule is triggered, and the subsequent repository scans are performed weekly. If required, you can change the scan schedule to a daily or monthly cadence. 

You can access the {AnsibleCodeBot} dashboard that displays all your repositories that have the bot installed along with their scan status. From the dashboard, you can start a manual scan, view the scan history, and view the repository. From GitHub, you can configure a schedule to scan your repository at regular intervals, and add or remove a repository from being scanned. For more information, see xref:manage-repo-scans_using-code-bot-for-suggestions[Managing repository scans].
