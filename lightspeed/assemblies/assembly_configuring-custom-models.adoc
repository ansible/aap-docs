As an organization administrator, you can train custom models using your organization's existing Ansible content. This capability enables you to improve the code recommendation experience and tune the model to your organization's automation patterns. For example, you can use intellectual property information, or private collections of Ansible data that are not open source, to train a custom model. As a result, the code recommendations are tailored to your business requirements and processes. 

You can configure multiple custom models for your organization. For example, you can create a custom model for your corporate IT automation team and a different model for your engineering team's infrastructure. 

To configure a custom model for your organization, perform the following tasks:
//add xrefs to the list below

. Create a custom model training dataset using the [AnsibleContentParser]
. Create a custom model using IBM watsonx Code Assistant
. Configure [lightspeedShortName] to use the custom model
