= Pulling {ExecEnvShort}s for use in {HubName}


[role="_abstract"]
Before you can push {ExecEnvShort}s to your {PrivateHubName}, you must first pull them from an existing registry and tag them for use. The following example details how to pull an {ExecEnvShort} from the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog (registry.redhat.io).

You must follow a specific workflow to populate your {PrivateHubName} remote registry:

* Pull {ExecEnvName} from the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog (registry.redhat.io)
* Tag them
* Push them to your {PrivateHubName} remote registry

[IMPORTANT]
====
As of *April 1st, 2025*, `quay.io` is adding three additional endpoints. As a result, customers must adjust the allow/block lists within their firewall systems lists to include the following endpoints:

* `cdn04.quay.io`
* `cdn05.quay.io`
* `cdn06.quay.io`

To avoid problems pulling container images, customers must allow outbound TCP connections (ports 80 and 443) to the following hostnames:

* `cdn.quay.io`
* `cdn01.quay.io`
* `cdn02.quay.io`
* `cdn03.quay.io`
* `cdn04.quay.io`
* `cdn05.quay.io`
* `cdn06.quay.io`

This change should be made to any firewall configuration that specifically enables outbound connections to `registry.redhat.io` or `registry.access.redhat.com`.

Use the hostnames instead of IP addresses when configuring firewall rules.

After making this change, you can continue to pull images from `registry.redhat.io` or `registry.access.redhat.com`. You do not require a `quay.io` login, or need to interact with the `quay.io` registry directly in any way to continue pulling Red Hat container images.

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7084334[Firewall changes for container image pulls 2024/2025].

Ensure that the link:{URLPlanningGuide}/ref-network-ports-protocols_planning[Network ports and protocols] listed in _Table 6.4. Execution Environments (EE)_ are available to avoid problems pulling container images.
