= Pushing container images from your local environment

[role="_abstract"]
Use the following procedure to sign an {ExecEnvNameSing} on a local system and push the signed {ExecEnvShort} to the {HubName} registry.

.Procedure
. From a terminal, log in to Podman, or any container client currently in use:
+
----
> podman pull <container-name>
----
+
. After the {ExecEnvShort} is pulled, add tags (for example: latest, rc, beta, or version numbers, such as 1.0; 2.3, and so on):
+
----
> podman tag <container-name> <server-address>/<container-name>:<tag name>
----
+
. Sign the {ExecEnvShort} after changes have been made, and push it back up to the {HubName} registry:
+
----
> podman push <server-address>/<container-name>:<tag name> --tls-verify=false --sign-by <reference to the gpg key on your local>
----
+
If the {ExecEnvShort} is not signed, it can only be pushed with any current signature embedded. Alternatively, you can use the following script to push the {ExecEnvShort} without signing it:
+
----
> podman push <server-address>/<container-name>:<tag name> --tls-verify=false
----
+
. Once the {ExecEnvShort} has been pushed, navigate to {MenuACExecEnvironments}.

. To display the new {ExecEnvShort}, click the *Refresh* icon.

. Click the name of the image to view your pushed image.

.Troubleshooting

The details page for each {ExecEnvShort} indicates whether it has been signed. If the details page indicates that an image is *Unsigned*, you can sign the {ExecEnvShort} from {HubName} using the following steps:

. Click the {ExecEnvShort} name to navigate to the details page.

. Click the btn:[More Actions] icon *{MoreActionsIcon}*.
Three options are available:
* *Sign {ExecEnvShort}*
* *Use in Controller*
* *Delete {ExecEnvShort}*


. Click *Sign {ExecEnvShort}* from the drop-down menu.

.Verification
The signing service signs the {ExecEnvShort}.
After the {ExecEnvShort} is signed, the status changes to "signed".
