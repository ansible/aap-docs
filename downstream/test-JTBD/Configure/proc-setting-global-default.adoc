Set a global default execution environment
To use supported execution environments, you can configure a specific execution environment globally, or you can set one per job template. 

To globally set a default execution environment for all jobs:

From the Ansible Automation Platform UI, go to Settings > Automation Execution > System. 
Click Edit.
From the Global default execution environment drop-down, select the default execution environment you want to set.
Click Save.
