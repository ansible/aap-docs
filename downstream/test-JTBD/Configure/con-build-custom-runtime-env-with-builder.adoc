{Builder} is a command line tool that automates the process of building {ExecEnvName} by using metadata defined in various Ansible Collections or created by the user.

[NOTE]
====
You must build an {ExecEnvShort} before you can create it using {ControllerName}. 
After building it, you must push it to a repository (such as quay) and then, when creating an {ExecEnvShort} in the UI with {ControllerName}, you must point to that repository to use it in {PlatformNameShort} to use it, for example, in a job template.

= Why use {Builder}?

[role="_abstract"]
With {Builder}, you can easily create a customizable {ExecEnvName} definition file that specifies the content you want included in your {ExecEnvName} such as Ansible Core, Python, Collections, third-party Python requirements, and system level packages. 
This enables you to fulfill all of the necessary requirements and dependencies to get jobs running.
