Use a default runtime environment
Ansible Automation Platform includes the following default runtime environments, or execution environments, which you can specify when setting up a job template in the Ansible Automation Platform UI or access them from automation hub. 
ee-minimal – Includes the latest Ansible-core 2.16 release along with Ansible Runner, but does not include collections or other content. Ansible-automation-platform-24 Includes the Ansible-core 2.15 release along with Ansible Runner, but does not include collections or other content. While supported execution environments cover many automation prerequisites, minimal execution-environments are the recommended basis for your own custom images, to keep full control over dependencies and their versions.
ee-supported - Contents of the minimal execution environment, plus all Red Hat-supported collections and dependencies.
You can set a global default execution environment for Ansible Automation Platform, or you can set one per job template.
