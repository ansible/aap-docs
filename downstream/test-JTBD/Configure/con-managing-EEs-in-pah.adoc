As an Ansible Automation Platform administrator, you can use your private automation hub container registry to store and manage container images, or execution environments, for your users. 

When you have built or sourced an execution environment, you can push that execution environment to the registry portion of private automation hub to create a container repository.

With your private automation hub container registry, you can: 
* Control who can access individual container repositories
* Change tags on images
* View activity and image layers
* Provide additional information related to each container repository
