//This snippet details the colocation configuration for a containerized install of AAP - note that it can be colocated with controller.
* 6 VMs are required for a Redis high availability (HA) compatible deployment. When installing {PlatformNameShort} with the containerized installer, Redis can be colocated on any {PlatformNameShort} component VMs of your choice except for execution nodes or the PostgreSQL database. They might also be assigned VMs specifically for Redis use.
* External Redis is not supported for containerized {PlatformNameShort}.
