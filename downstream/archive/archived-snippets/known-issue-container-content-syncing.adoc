* When installing the growth topology for the {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 containerized setup bundle, you must disable content syncing which is enabled by default. To disable this feature set the `hub_seed_collections` variable in the inventory file to false. See link:{URLTopologies}/container-topologies#cont-a-env-a[Container growth topology] for a sample inventory file and see link:{URLContainerizedInstall}/appendix-inventory-files-vars#ref-hub-variables[{HubNameStart} variables] for more information about this inventory file variable.
