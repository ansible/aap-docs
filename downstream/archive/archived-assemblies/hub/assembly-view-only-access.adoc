= Enable view-only access for your {PrivateHubName}

By enabling view-only access, you can grant access for users to view collections or namespaces on your {PrivateHubName} without requiring them to log in. View-only access allows you to share content with unauthorized users while restricting their ability to view or download source code. They will not have permissions to edit anything on your {PrivateHubName}.
