== Assigning roles to groups
//[ddacosta] This intro needs to be verified against the flow being described. Are Groups and Namespaces actual menus or are they tab selections from within the Roles or Groups details pages?
You can assign roles to groups, giving users access to specific features in the system, from both the *Groups* menu and the *Namespaces* menu. Roles assigned to a group from the *Groups* menu have a global scope. For example, if a user is assigned a namespace owner role, that permission applies to all namespaces. However, roles assigned to a group from the _Namespaces_ menu will only give a user access to a specific instance of an object.
