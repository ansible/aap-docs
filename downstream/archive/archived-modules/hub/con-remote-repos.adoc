= Reasons to create remote configurations

Each remote configuration located in {MenuACAdminRemotes} provides information for both the *community* and *rh-certified* repository about when the repository was *last updated*.
You can add new content to {HubNameMain} at any time using the *Edit* and *Sync* features included on the {MenuACAdminRepositories} page.
