= Specifying package versions

For production systems, a well-established configuration management practice is to deploy only known, tested combinations of software to ensure that systems are configured correctly and perform as expected. 
This includes deploying only known versions of operating system software and patches to ensure that system updates do not introduce problems with production applications. 

[NOTE]
====
The following example playbook installs a specific version of the `httpd` RPM and its dependencies when the target host uses the RHEL 9 operating system. 
This playbook does not take action if the specified versions are already in place or if a different version of RHEL is installed.

----
- name: Install specific RPM versions
  hosts: target_hosts
  gather_facts: true
  become: true

  vars:
    httpd_packages_rhel9:
      - httpd-2.4.53-11.el9_2.5

        name: '{{ httpd_packages_rhel9 }}'

        allow_downgrade: true
    when:
      - ansible_distribution == "RedHat"
      - ansible_distribution_major_version == "9"
----

[NOTE]
==== 
By setting `allow_downgrade: true`, if a newer version of any defined package is installed on the system, it is downgraded to the specified version instead.
