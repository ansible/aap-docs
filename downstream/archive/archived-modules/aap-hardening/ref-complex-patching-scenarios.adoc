= Complex patching scenarios

In {PlatformNameShort}, multiple automation jobs can be chained together into workflows, which can be used to coordinate multiple steps in a complex patching scenario. 

The following example complex patching scenario demonstrates taking virtual machine snapshots, patching the virtual machines, and creating tickets when an error is encountered in the workflow. 

. Run a project sync to ensure the latest playbooks are available. In parallel, run an inventory sync to make sure the latest list of target hosts is available.
. Take a snapshot of each target host.
.. If the snapshot task fails, submit a ticket with the relevant information.
. Patch each of the target hosts.
.. If the patching task fails, restore the snapshot and submit a ticket with the relevant information.
. Delete each snapshot where the patching task was successful.

The following workflow visualization shows how the components of the example complex patching scenario are executed:
