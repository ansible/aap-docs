. Open the Helm chart for your deployment.
. Locate the `catalog.locations` section of the Helm chart:
+
----
     locations:
       - type: file
       target: /software-templates/seed.yaml
       rules:
         - allow: [Template]
----
. Comment out the `type`, `target`, and `rules` keys of `catalog.locations` by adding a `#` character:
+
----
     locations:
       # - type: file
       # target: /software-templates/seed.yaml
       # rules:
       #   - allow: [Template]
----
. Click *Create* to re-launch the deployment.
