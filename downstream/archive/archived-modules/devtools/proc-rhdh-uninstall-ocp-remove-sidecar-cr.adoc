[id="rhdh-uninstall-ocp-operator-remove-sidecar-cr_{context}"]
= Removing the custom resource ConfigMap from the {RHDHShort} Operator Custom Resource 

// If a custom resource is created to load the sidecar container,
//we need to be specific about what we remove while we are willing to remove just the sidecar container,
// because the customResouce acts as the source of truth for the entire RHDH deployment then. 
// 
If you created a custom resource ConfigMap
as described in the xref:rhdh-create-operator-custom-configmap-operator-install_rhdh-install-ocp-operator[Creating a custom Operator ConfigMap]
and you added only the {ToolsName} sidecar container to it, then you can remove the reference to the ConfigMap from the {RHDHShort} Custom Resource. 

[NOTE]
====
Ensure that you do not have any additional need for the custom ConfigMap before you remove it from the Custom Resource.
