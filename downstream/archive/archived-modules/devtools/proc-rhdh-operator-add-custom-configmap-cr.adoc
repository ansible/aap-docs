// We should be able to see existing config maps that handle the app-config for rhdh instance and a different configMap that would serve the dynamic plugins that are being installed.

// Considering the custom ConfigMaps are named -

// - rhaap-dynamic-plugins-config - contains dynamic plugins to be installed
