= Removing the Sidecar container from the {RHDHShort} Custom Resource ConfigMap

// Remove sidecar from rhdh-custom-config

// Do this if you need config apart from the Sidecar container to your `rhdh-custom-config` Custom Resource ConfigMap.

If you added extra configuration to the ConfigMap where you added the sidecar container (`rhdh-custom-config` in our example), then you cannot remove the reference to the ConfigMap from the {RHDHShort} Custom Resource.

Instead, you must remove only the YAML code relating to the sidecar from the ConfigMap.

//created a custom resource ConfigMap
//as described in the xref:rhdh-create-operator-custom-configmap-operator-install_rhdh-install-ocp-operator[Creating a custom Operator ConfigMap]
//and you added only the {ToolsName} sidecar container to it, then you can remove the reference to the ConfigMap from the {RHDHShort} Custom Resource.
