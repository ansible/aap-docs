= Adding additional Source Control Management options

The standard Ansible plug-ins templates are preconfigured to support GitHub Cloud.
Follow the procedure below to add support for additional Source Control Management (SCM) solutions.

.Procedure

. Create a fork of the link:https://github.com/ansible/ansible-rhdh-templates/blob/main/all.yaml[Ansible plug-ins software templates repository].
. In your repository, update the `enum` and `enumNames` keys with the SCM values.
. Update the software template `action` to match your SCM type.
. Register the forked repository with your customized templates in {RHDH}.

For example, if you wanted to add GitLab as an SCM, your software template file would look similar to the following: 

----
...
spec:
  ...
  parameters:
    ...
      properties:
        sourceControl:
          title: Select source control option
          type: string
          description: Select the source control option for your Ansible project.
          default: gitlab.com
          enum:
            - gitlab.com
          enumNames:
            - 'GitLab'
...

----

Under the `steps` section, use the appropriate action for your SCM:

----
  steps:
  ...
    - id: publish
      name: Publish
      action: publish:gitlab
  ...  

----
