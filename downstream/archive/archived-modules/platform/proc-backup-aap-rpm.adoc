= Backing up RPM-based {PlatformNameShort}

[role="_abstract"]
Back up an existing {PlatformNameShort} instance by running the `setup.sh` script with the `backup_dir` flag. 
This saves the content and configuration of your current environment.

.Procedure
. Go to your {PlatformNameShort} installation directory.

. Run the `setup.sh` script following the example below:
+
----
$ ./setup.sh -e 'backup_dir=/ansible/mybackup' -e 'use_compression=True' @credentials.yml -b
----
+
* `backup_dir` specifies a directory to save your backup to.
+
* `@credentials.yml` passes the password variables and their values that are encrypted by `ansible-vault`.

. With a successful backup, a backup file is created at `/ansible/mybackup/<platform_installation_directory_name>.tar.gz`.
