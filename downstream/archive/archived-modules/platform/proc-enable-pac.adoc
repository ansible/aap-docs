= Enabling policy enforcement

During installation, you must configure your {PlatformNameShort} instance to include the policy enforcement feature. You can do this by modifying the feature flag variables in your configuration file.
Follow the instructions below relevant to your installation type.

.{OCPShort} Installation

For {OCPShort} installations, you must modify the {PlatformNameShort} custom resource. Add the following to the spec section: 

[source,yaml]
----
spec: 
  feature_flags: 
    FEATURE_POLICY_AS_CODE_ENABLED: True 
----

After applying the changes, wait for the operator to complete the update process. The operator automatically handles the necessary service restarts and configuration updates.

.RPM Installation

For RPM-based installations, modify the inventory file used by the installer to add the following variable: 

[source,yaml]
----
feature_flags: 
  FEATURE_POLICY_AS_CODE_ENABLED: True 
----

See link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html#defining-variables-at-runtime[Defining variables at runtime] for more on adding vars. After modifying the inventory file, rerun the installer to apply changes. 

.Containerized Installation

For containerized installations, modify the inventory file used by the installer to add: 

[source,yaml]
----
feature_flags: 
  FEATURE_POLICY_AS_CODE_ENABLED: True 
----

After modifying the inventory file, rerun the installer to apply the changes. 

.Verifying feature flag status

To verify that the feature flag is enabled, you can check the feature flags state endpoint:

[source,yaml]
----
https://<your-aap-host>/api/controller/v2/feature_flags_state/
----
The endpoint will return a `JSON` response containing the current state of all feature flags, including `FEATURE_POLICY_AS_CODE_ENABLED`.
