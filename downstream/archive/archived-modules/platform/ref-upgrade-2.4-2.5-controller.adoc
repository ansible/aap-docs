= {ControllerNameStart}

When customers upgrade from 2.4 to 2.5, the entity relationships in {ControllerName} remain in that service even if teams are not present in the UX.  
Team mappings are not moved from {ControllerName} in 2.4 to the {Gateway} when upgrading to 2.5. You will not see team mappings in the UI without manually creating those relationships in {Gateway}. 
In addition, teams from {ControllerName}, for example, are not synced to other services, such as {PrivateHubName} or {EDAName}.

If you used the {ControllerName} APIs or collections to create nested teams of teams, you can still use {ControllerName}-specific permissions inherited from this structure.  
If you used it in 2.4, then it will still work in 2.5. 
However, your organization should begin to plan for this functionality to be removed in later versions of {PlatformNameShort}.  
To do this, your user and team integration/automation can map users directly to multiple teams.
