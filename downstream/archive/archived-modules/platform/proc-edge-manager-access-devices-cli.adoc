= Accessing devices on the CLI

Access and manage devices directly through the CLI, enabling you to perform tasks remotely and efficiently.

.Procedure

* To connect, use the `flightctl console` command specifying the device's name, and the agent establishes the console connection the next time it calls home (pull mode) or instantaneously (push mode):

[source,console]
----
flightctl console <some_device_name>
----

* To disconnect, enter "exit" on the console. 
To force-disconnect, press `<ctrl>+b` three times.
