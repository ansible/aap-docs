= Migrating Single Sign-On (SSO) users
 
[role="_abstract"]

When upgrading from {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 to 2.5, you must migrate your Single Sign-On (SSO) user accounts if you want to continue using SSO capabilities after the upgrade. Follow the steps in this procedure to ensure a smooth SSO user migration. 

== Key considerations

*SSO configurations are not migrated automatically during upgrade to 2.5:* While the legacy authentication settings are carried over during the upgrade process and allow seamless initial access to the platform after upgrade, SSO configurations must be manually migrated over to a new {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 authentication configuration. The legacy configuration acts as a reference to preserve existing authentication capabilities and facilitate the migration process. The legacy authentication configuration should not be modified directly or used after migration is complete.

*SSO migration is supported in the UI:* Migration of legacy SSO accounts is supported in 2.5 UI, and is done by selecting your legacy authenticator from the *Auto migrate users from* list when you configure a new authentication method. This is the legacy authenticator from which to automatically migrate users to a new {Gateway} authentication configuration.

*Migration of SSO must happen before users log in and start account linking:* You must enable the *Auto migrate users to* setting _after_ configuring SSO in 2.5 and _before_ any users log in.

[Removed for AAP-41494]
//.Prerequisites
//You have configured a SSO authentication method in the {Gateway} following the steps in link:{URLCentralAuth}/gw-configure-authentication#gw-config-authentication-type[Configuring an authentication type]. This will be the configuration that you will migrate your previous SSO users to. 

[NOTE]
====
{PlatformNameShort} 2.4 SSO configurations are renamed during the upgrade process and are displayed in the *Authentication Methods* list view with a prefix to indicate a legacy configuration: for example,  `legacy_sso-saml-<entity id>`. The *Authentication type* is also listed as *legacy sso*. These configurations can not be modified.
====

//[This procedure is obsolete now that migration is supported in the UI AAP-41494]
//.Procedure
//. Log in to the {Gateway} API.
//. Go to `/api/gateway/v1/authenticators/`, locate the legacy authenticator and click the link. 
//. This opens the HTML form for that authenticator. 
//. Select the new {Gateway} authenticator from the *Auto migrate users to* list. 
//. Click btn:[PUT]. 

Once you set up the auto migrate functionality, you should be able to login with SSO in the {Gateway} and it will automatically link any matching accounts from the legacy SSO authenticator.
