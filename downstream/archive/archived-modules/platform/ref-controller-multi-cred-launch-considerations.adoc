= Launch time considerations

Before {Controllername} v3.3, job templates used a configurable attribute, `ask_credential_on_launch`. 
This value was used at launch time to decide which missing credential values were necessary for launch. 
This was a way to specify a Machine or SSH credential to satisfy the minimum credential requirement.

Under the unified credential list model, this attribute still exists, but it no longer requires a credential. 
Now when `ask_credential_on_launch` is `true`, it signifies that you can specify a list of credentials at launch time to override those defined on the job template. For example:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
POST /api/v2/job_templates/N/launch/ {'credentials': [A, B, C]}`
----

If `ask_credential_on_launch` is `false`, it signifies that custom credentials provided in the `POST /api/v2/job_templates/N/launch/` are ignored.

Under this model, the only purpose for `ask_credential_on_launch` is to signal API clients to prompt the user for (optional) changes at launch
time.
