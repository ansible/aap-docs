= Accessing devices remotely

For troubleshooting an edge device, a user can be authorized to remotely connect to that device's console through the agent. 
This does not require an SSH connection and works even if that device is on a private network (behind a NAT), has a dynamic IP address, or has its SSH service disabled.
