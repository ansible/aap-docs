= {RedHatEdge} authorization

The {RedHatEdge} Kubernetes authorization uses role-based access control (RBAC) to control authorization for {RedHatEdge} API endpoints. 

You can set up Kubernetes RBAC authorization by using the following roles:

* `Role` and `RoleBinding` for namespace-wide authorization
* `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` for cluster-wide authorization

You can use the `Role` or `ClusterRole` API objects to define the allowed API resources and verbs for a particular role.

The `RoleBinding` or `ClusterRoleBinding` API objects grant permissions that are defined in a role to one or more users.
