= Configuring storage for {HubName}

Configure storage backends for {HubName} including Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Network File System (NFS) storage.

== Configuring Amazon S3 storage for {HubName}

Amazon S3 storage is a type of object storage that is supported in containerized installations. When using an AWS S3 storage backend, set `hub_storage_backend` to `s3`. The AWS S3 bucket needs to exist before running the installation program.

The variables you can use to configure this storage backend type in your inventory file are:

* `hub_s3_access_key`
* `hub_s3_secret_key`
* `hub_s3_bucket_name`
* `hub_s3_extra_settings`

Extra parameters can be passed through an Ansible `hub_s3_extra_settings` dictionary.

For example, you can set the following parameters:

----
hub_s3_extra_settings:
  AWS_S3_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE: 4096
  AWS_S3_REGION_NAME: eu-central-1
  AWS_S3_USE_SSL: True
----

For more information about the list of parameters, see link:https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html#settings[django-storages documentation - Amazon S3].

== Configuring Azure Blob Storage for {HubName}

Azure Blob storage is a type of object storage that is supported in containerized installations. 
When using an Azure blob storage backend, set `hub_storage_backend` to `azure`. The Azure container needs to exist before running the installation program.

The variables you can use to configure this storage backend type in your inventory file are:

* `hub_azure_account_key`
* `hub_azure_account_name`
* `hub_azure_container`
* `hub_azure_extra_settings`

Extra parameters can be passed through an Ansible `hub_azure_extra_settings` dictionary.

For example, you can set the following parameters:

----
hub_azure_extra_settings:
For more information about the list of parameters, see link:https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/azure.html#settings[django-storages documentation - Azure Storage].
  AZURE_LOCATION: foo
  AZURE_SSL: True
  AZURE_URL_EXPIRATION_SECS: 60
----


== Configuring Network File System (NFS) storage for {HubName}

NFS is a type of shared storage that is supported in containerized installations. Shared storage is required when installing more than one instance of {HubName} with a `file` storage backend. When installing a single instance of the {HubName}, shared storage is optional.

* To configure shared storage for {HubName}, set the following variable in the inventory file, ensuring your NFS share has read, write, and execute permissions:

----
hub_shared_data_path=<path_to_nfs_share>
----

* The value must match the format `host:dir`, for example `nfs-server.example.com:/exports/hub`.

* To change the mount options for your NFS share, use the `hub_shared_data_mount_opts` variable. This variable is optional and the default value is `rw,sync,hard`.
