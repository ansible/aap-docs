{ControllerNameStart} Job templates have a single interface for credential assignment.

From the API endpoint:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
GET /api/v2/job_templates/N/credentials/
----

You can also associate and disassociate credentials using `POST` requests, similar to the behavior in the deprecated `extra_credentials` endpoint:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
POST /api/v2/job_templates/N/credentials/ {'associate': true, 'id': 'X'}
POST /api/v2/job_templates/N/credentials/ {'disassociate': true, 'id': 'Y'}
----

With this model, a job template is considered valid even when there are _no_ credentials assigned to it. 
This model also provides users the ability to assign multiple Vault credentials to a job template.
