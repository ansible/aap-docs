= Migrating LDAP users
 
[role="_abstract"]

As a platform administrator upgrading from {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 to 2.5, you must migrate your LDAP user accounts if you want to continue using LDAP authentication capabilities after the upgrade. Follow the steps in this procedure to  ensure the smoothest possible LDAP user migration.

There are two primary scenarios for migrating users from legacy authentication systems to LDAP-based authentication:

. Legacy user login and account linking
. Migration to LDAP without account linking

== Key considerations

*LDAP configurations are not migrated automatically during upgrade to 2.5:* While the legacy LDAP authentication settings are carried over during the upgrade process and allow seamless initial access to the platform after upgrade, LDAP configurations must be manually migrated over to a new {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 LDAP  configuration. The legacy configuration acts as a reference to preserve existing  authentication capabilities and facilitate the migration process. The legacy authentication configuration should not be modified directly or used after migration is complete.

*UID collision risk:* LDAP and legacy password authenticators both use usernames as the UID. This can cause UID collisions between users or users with the same name owned by different people. Any user accounts that are not secure for auto-migration due to UID conflicts must be manually migrated to ensure proper handling. You can manually migrate these users through the API `/api/gateway/v1/authenticator_users/` before setting auto-migrations.

*Do not log in using legacy LDAP authentication if you do not have a user account in the platform prior to the upgrade:* Instead, you must link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html-single/installing_on_openshift_container_platform/index#proc-migrate-LDAP-users[auto migrate directly to LDAP without linking accounts].
