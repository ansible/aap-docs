{CertifiedName} are included in your subscription to {PlatformName}.
Using {HubNameMain}, you can access and curate a unique set of collections from all forms of Ansible content.

Red Hat Ansible content contains two types of content:

* {CertifiedName}
* {Valid} collections

{Valid} collections are available in your {PrivateHubName} through the Platform Installer.
When you download {PlatformNameShort} with the bundled installer, validated content is pre-populated into the {PrivateHubName} by default,
but only if you enable the {PrivateHubName} as part of the inventory.

If you are not using the bundle installer, you can use a Red Hat-supplied Ansible Playbook to install validated content.
For further information, see Ansible validated content.

You can update validated collections manually by downloading their updated packages in {HubName}.
