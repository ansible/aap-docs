= Creating a secret key secret

[role=_abstract]

To migrate your data to {OperatorPlatformNameShort} on {OCPShort}, you must create a secret key.
If you are migrating {ControllerName}, {HubName}, and {EDAName} you must have a secret key for each that matches the secret key defined in the inventory file during your initial installation.
Otherwise, the migrated data remains encrypted and unusable after migration.

[NOTE]
====
When specifying the symmetric encryption secret key on the custom resources, note that for {ControllerName} the field is called `secret_key_name`.  But for {HubName} and {EDAName}, the field is called `db_fields_encryption_secret`.

====

[NOTE]
====
In the Kubernetes secrets, {ControllerName} and {EDAName} use the same stringData key (`secret_key`) but, {HubName} uses a different key (`database_fields.symmetric.key`).
====

.Procedure

. Locate the old secret keys in the inventory file you used to deploy {PlatformNameShort} in your previous installation.
. Create a YAML file for your secret keys:
+
-----
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <controller-resourcename>-secret-key
  namespace: <target-namespace>
stringData:
  secret_key: <content of /etc/tower/SECRET_KEY from old controller>
type: Opaque
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <eda-resourcename>-secret-key
  namespace: <target-namespace>
stringData:
  secret_key: </etc/ansible-automation-platform/eda/SECRET_KEY>
type: Opaque
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <hub-resourcename>-secret-key
  namespace: <target-namespace>
stringData:
  database_fields.symmetric.key: </etc/pulp/certs/database_fields.symmetric.key>
type: Opaque

-----
+
[NOTE]
====
If `admin_password_secret` is not provided, the operator looks for a secret named `<resourcename>-admin-password` for the admin password.
If it is not present, the operator generates a password and creates a secret from it named `<resourcename>-admin-password`.
====
+
. Apply the secret key YAML to the cluster:
+
-----
oc apply -f <yaml-file>
