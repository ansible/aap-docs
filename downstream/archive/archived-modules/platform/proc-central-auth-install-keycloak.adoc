[id="proc-central-auth-install-keycloak"]

= Install Keycloak with Ansible

When you have installed the collection and dependencies necessary for your network to run the installation of Keycloak performs the following actions on  the system running it:

* Creates user and group accounts

* Downloads the installation archive from the Keycloak website

* Unarchives the content you downloaded while ensuring that the files are associated with the correct users and privileges

* Verifies that your version of Java Virtual Machine is up-to-date

* Integrates Keycloak into the host service management system (e.g., systemd daemon)

[NOTE]
====
Both user and group account names are keycloak by default.
====

. Create the following playbook:
+
- name: Playbook for Keycloak Hosts
  hosts: all
  vars:
    keycloak_admin_password: "remembertochangeme"
    keycloak_realm: TestRealm
  collections:
    - middleware_automation.keycloak
  roles:
    - keycloak


The configuration adds {PlatformNameShort}'s collection for Keycloak to the list the playbook uses, and the associated `middleware_automation.keycloak.keycloak`.

[NOTE]
====
The password at the end of the playbook creation at the variable ˋkeycloak_admin_passwordˋ must be a minimum of 12 characters.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The playbook uses a variable for the Keycloak server administrator. Because this variable is a password, it must be secured using Ansible Vault or another secret management system.

. Run the following playbook:
+
# ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml

. Example 1
Example 1. Configuring single sign-on for use with Ansible in the same playbook
[example]
---
- name: Playbook for Keycloak Hosts
  hosts: all
  vars:
    keycloak_admin_password: "remembertochangeme"
    keycloak_realm: TestRealm
  collections:
    - middleware_automation.keycloak
  roles:
    - keycloak
  tasks:
 - name: Keycloak Realm Role
  	ansible.builtin.include_role:
    	name: keycloak_realm
  	vars:
    	keycloak_client_default_roles:
      	- TestRoleAdmin
      	- TestRoleUser
    	keycloak_client_users:
      	- username: TestUser
        	password: password
        	client_roles:
          	- client: TestClient
            	role: TestRoleUser
            	realm: "{{ keycloak_realm }}"
      	- username: TestAdmin
        	password: password
        	client_roles:
          	- client: TestClient
            	role: TestRoleUser
            	realm: "{{ keycloak_realm }}"
          	- client: TestClient
            	role: TestRoleAdmin
            	realm: "{{ keycloak_realm }}"
    	keycloak_realm: TestRealm
    	keycloak_clients:
      	- name: TestClient
        	roles: "{{ keycloak_client_default_roles }}"
        	realm: "{{ keycloak_realm }}"
        	public_client: "{{ keycloak_client_public }}"
        	web_origins: "{{ keycloak_client_web_origins }}"
        	users: "{{ keycloak_client_users }}"
        	client_id: TestClient

[NOTE]
====
The playbook in Example 1 is the only playbook being used in this procedure. The following code blocks contain text from the same playbook. As a result, you are only modifying variables from one example. The examples following this note are truncated for findability and ease of understanding.

In Example 1, there are also no sources for authentication being used. This makes it easier to test your configuration before you deploy it. However, Red Hat recommends the use of LDAP as the authentication application.
====

When you have configured single sign-on, there are several variables within the code provided that must be defined and are left blank. They must be defined before the playbook can work automatically.

. Define the realm, so the other variables within the realm execute properly.
+
[listing]
… 
     	 	- client: TestClient
       		 role: TestRoleAdmin
       		 realm: "{{ keycloak_realm }}"
   	 keycloak_realm: TestRealm
   	 keycloak_clients:
…

With the realm defined, you can define the roles and permissions for the users:
+
[listing]
…
    	keycloak_client_default_roles:
 		 - TestRoleAdmin
 		 - TestRoleUser
   	 keycloak_client_users:
 		 - username: TestUser
   		 password: password
   		 client_roles:
     		 - client: TestClient
       		 role: TestRoleUser
       		 realm: "{{ keycloak_realm }}"
…

In this example, the first part of the code defined two default roles: `TestRoleAdmin` and `TestRoleUser`. Before defining an administrator role, define the typical user role with a password, their client, their role, and the realm.

. Continue defining other roles your organization needs:
+
[listing]

 		 - username: TestAdmin
   		 password: password
   		 client_roles:
     		 - client: TestClient
       		 role: TestRoleUser
       		 realm: "{{ keycloak_realm }}"
     		 - client: TestClient
       		 role: TestRoleAdmin
       		 realm: "{{ keycloak_realm }}"
…


With the typical user role defined, you can now supply the information appropriate for an administrator. `TestRoleUser` is only given the permission to exist within the defined realm and what it can do. However, `TestRoleAdmin` has the same permissions as `TestRoleUser`, in addition to connecting to the SSO server and configuring or updating the realm.

. Define the client for roles to apply to the users who use them:
+
[listing]
…
    	keycloak_clients:
      	- name: TestClient
        	roles: "{{ keycloak_client_default_roles }}"
        	realm: "{{ keycloak_realm }}"
        	public_client: "{{ keycloak_client_public }}"
        	web_origins: "{{ keycloak_client_web_origins }}"
        	users: "{{ keycloak_client_users }}"

…

At this point, you have defined all the variables your playbook requires to run smoothly.

Optionally, add a check to your playbook that uses Keycloak’s administration credentials to get an SSO token. 

[listing]
- name: Verify token api call
  ansible.builtin.uri:
    url: "http://localhost:{{ keycloak_port }}/auth/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/token"
    method: POST
    body: "client_id=admin-cli&username=admin&password={{ keycloak_admin_password }}&grant_type=password"
    validate_certs: no
    register: keycloak_auth_response
    until: keycloak_auth_response.status == 200
    retries: 2
    delay: 2


[NOTE]
====
ˋkeycloakportˋ is 8080 by default.

.Verification

If you get an authentication response of “200”, the playbook successfully connects to the server and authenticates as expected. Any other response is a failure.
