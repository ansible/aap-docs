Previously, job templates had the following requirements with respect to credentials:

* All job templates (and jobs) were required to have exactly _one_ Machine/SSH or Vault credential (or one of both).
* All job templates (and jobs) could have zero or more "extra" credentials.
* Extra credentials represented "Cloud" and "Network" credentials that could be used to give authentication to external services through environment variables, for example, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`.

This model required a variety of disjoint interfaces for specifying credentials on a job template. 
It also lacked the ability to associate many Vault credentials with a playbook run, a use case supported by Ansible core.

This model also poses a stumbling block for certain playbook execution workflows, such as having to attach a "dummy" Machine and SSH credential to the job template to satisfy the requirement.
