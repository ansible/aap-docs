= Scan job templates

Scan jobs are no longer supported starting with {ControllerName} 3.2.
This system tracking feature was used as a way to capture and store facts as historical data. Facts are now stored in the controller through fact caching.
For more information, see xref:controller-fact-caching[Fact Caching].

Job template scan jobs in your system before {ControllerName} 3.2, are converted to type run, like normal job templates.
They retain their associated resources, such as inventories and credentials.
By default, job template scan jobs that do not have a related project are assigned a special playbook.
You can also specify a project with your own scan playbook.
A project is created for each organization that points to link:https://github.com/ansible/tower-fact-modules[awx-facts-playbooks] and the job template was set to the playbook: https://github.com/ansible/tower-fact-modules/blob/master/scan_facts.yml.
