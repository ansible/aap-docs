[id="controller-referrals"]

= Referrals

Active Directory uses "referrals" in case the queried object is not available in its database. 
This does not work correctly with the django LDAP client and it helps to disable referrals. 

Disable LDAP referrals by adding the following lines to your `/etc/tower/conf.d/custom.py` file:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
AUTH_LDAP_GLOBAL_OPTIONS = {
    ldap.OPT_REFERRALS: False,
}
----
