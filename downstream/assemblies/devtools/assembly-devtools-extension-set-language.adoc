= Manually adding the Ansible language to YAML files

[role="_abstract"]

The Ansible {VSCode} extension works only when the language associated with a file is set to Ansible.
The extension provides features that help create Ansible playbooks, such as auto-completion, hover, and diagnostics.

The Ansible {VSCode} extension automatically associates the Ansible language with some files.
The procedures below describe how to set the language for files that are not recognized as Ansible files.
