{ToolsName} (`ansible-dev-tools`) is a suite of tools provided with {PlatformNameShort} to help automation creators to
create, test, and deploy playbook projects, execution environments, and collections.

The Ansible {VSCode} extension by Red Hat integrates most of the {ToolsName}:
you can use these tools from the {VSCode} user interface.

Use {ToolsName} during local development of playbooks, local testing, and in a CI pipeline (linting and testing).

This document describes how to use {ToolsName} to create a playbook project that contains playbooks and roles that you can reuse within the project.
It also describes how to test the playbooks and deploy the project on your {AAP} instance so that you can use the playbooks in automation jobs.
