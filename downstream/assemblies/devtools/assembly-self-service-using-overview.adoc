To populate {SelfServiceShort} with templates,
you must create repositories in GitHub or Gitlab for collections that define the templates.

Currently, Red Hat provides validated content with examples to automate jobs for RHEL, Network, Windows, and Cloud using {SelfServiceShort}.

[NOTE]
====
The validated content examples provided have their own support statement and lifecycle definitions.
Refer to the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/ansible-automation-platform#validated[Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Life Cycle].
====

These collections are hosted in {HubName}.
Your administrator must add the collections to {PrivateHubName} so that you can download them and create the repositories.

You can then import templates into your {SelfServiceShort}, and launch them to run automation jobs.
