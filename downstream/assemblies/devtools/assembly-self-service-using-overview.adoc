You can launch templates from {SelfServiceShort} to execute job templates from your existing {PlatformNameShort} setup. 

* Auto-generated self-service templates are automatically synced from the job templates in {PlatformNameShort} to the {SelfServiceShort}. The forms for the auto-generated templates are identical to the forms for the job templates.
* You can import custom self-service templates from a Git repository. A configuration file links each custom template to a specific job template in {PlatformNameShort} and contains the forms that users must complete.

You can associate multiple custom self-service templates with a single {PlatformNameShort} job template.
You can use role-based access control (RBAC) to assign different custom self-service templates for users with different levels of automation experience.
For example, you can design a simplified template with a narrow scope for configuration for new users, and a more detailed template for automation experts.


// Currently, Red Hat provides validated content with examples to automate jobs for RHEL, Network, Windows, and Cloud using {SelfServiceShort}.
// 
// [NOTE]
// ====
// The validated content examples provided have their own support statement and lifecycle definitions.
// Refer to the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/ansible-automation-platform#validated[Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Life Cycle].
// ====
// 
// These collections are hosted in {HubName}.
// Your administrator must add the collections to {PrivateHubName} so that you can download them and create the repositories.
// 
// You can then import templates into your {SelfServiceShort}, and launch them to run automation jobs.
