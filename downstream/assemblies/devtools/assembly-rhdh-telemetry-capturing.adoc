= {RHDH} data telemetry capturing

{RHDH} (RHDH) sends telemetry data to Red Hat using the `backstage-plugin-analytics-provider-segment` plug-in, which is enabled by default.
This includes telemetry data from the Ansible plug-ins.

Red Hat collects and analyzes the following data to improve your experience with {RHDH}:

* Events of page visits and clicks on links or buttons.
* System-related information, for example, locale, timezone, user agent including browser and OS details.
* Page-related information, for example, title, category, extension name, URL, path, referrer, and search parameters.
* Anonymized IP addresses, recorded as 0.0.0.0.
* Anonymized username hashes, which are unique identifiers used solely to identify the number of unique users of the RHDH application.
* Feedback and sentiment provided in the Ansible plug-ins feedback form.

With {RHDH}, you can disable or customize the telemetry data collection feature.
