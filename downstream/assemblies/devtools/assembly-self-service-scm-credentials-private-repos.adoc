= Configuring source control credentials for private repositories

:context: self-service-using-scm-credentials-private-repos

To work with private repositories, you must add your GitHub or Gitlab personal access tokens to {PlatformNameShort} as a source control credential.

[NOTE]
====
Ensure that the {PlatformNameShort} users and teams assigned to the {PlatformNameShort} objects,
such as source control credentials,
are part of the {PlatformNameShort} Organization configured to sync to the {SelfServiceShort}.
See _{LinkSelfServiceInstall}_ for more information.
