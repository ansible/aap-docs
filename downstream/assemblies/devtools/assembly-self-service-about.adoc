= About {SelfService}

:context: self-service-about

{SelfServiceShortStart} makes enterprise automation accessible to users of varying roles and skill levels through a simplified web interface designed for business users, not automation experts.

Instead of requiring users to understand Ansible playbooks or complex automation workflows,
{SelfServiceShort}  provides a streamlined "point-and-click" experience. 

{SelfServiceShortStart} uses your existing {PlatformNameShort} setup:
it uses the same logins, same security controls, and the same automation logic.

Job templates in {PlatformNameShort} are synced to {SelfServiceShort},
where they appear as auto-generated self-service templates.
Users can launch the auto-generated  self-service templates in {SelfServiceShort} to run the corresponding job templates in {PlatformNameShort}.

When launching a job, users follow step-by-step guided forms in {SelfServiceShort}.
These forms are identical to the forms for the equivalent job templates in {PlatformNameShort}.

You can also import custom self-service templates in {SelfServiceShort}.
These templates are pulled from a git repository, and their configuration file associates them with a job template in {PlatformNameShort}.
The configuration file contains the forms for the template.

You can associate more than one custom self-service template with one {PlatformNameShort} job template.
You set the RBAC for the custom self-service templates in {SelfServiceShort}.
Therefore you can set up different types of forms for users with different levels of automation experience.

For example, for a job template that configures network settings,
you could associate  a custom template with minimum scope for adjusting settings to a group with less automation experience,
and use a more detailed custom template with deeper scope for configuration for automation experts.

{SelfServiceShortStart} connects with {PlatformName} using an OAuth application for authentication.

The following restrictions apply:

* You can only use one {PlatformNameShort} instance.
* You can only use one {PlatformNameShort} organization.
