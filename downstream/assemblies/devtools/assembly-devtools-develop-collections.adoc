Collections are a distribution format for Ansible content that can include playbooks, roles, modules, and plugins. 
Red Hat provides Ansible Content Collections on Ansible automation hub that contain both {CertifiedCon} and {Valid}.

If you have installed private automation hub, you can create collections for your organization and push them
to {PrivateHubName} so that you can use them in job templates in {PlatformNameShort}. 
You can use collections to package and distribute plug-ins. These plug-ins are written in Python.

You can also create collections to package and distribute Ansible roles, which are expressed in YAML.
You can also include playbooks and custom plug-ins that are required for these roles in the collection.
Typically, collections of roles are distributed for use within your organization.
