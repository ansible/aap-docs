:context: self-service-telemetry

The telemetry data collection feature helps in collecting and analyzing the telemetry data to improve your experience with self-service technical preview. This feature is enabled by default.

Red Hat collects and analyses the following data:

* Events of page visits and clicks on links or buttons.
* System-related information, for example, locale, timezone, user agent including browser and OS details.
* Page-related information, for example, title, category, extension name, URL, path, referrer, and search parameters.
* Anonymized IP addresses, recorded as 0.0.0.0.
* Anonymized username hashes, which are unique identifiers used solely to identify the number of unique users of the RHDH application.
* Feedback and sentiment provided in the feedback form.

// With Red Hat Developer Hub, you can disable or customize the telemetry data collection feature. 
// For more information, refer to the Telemetry data collection guide in the Red Hat Developer Hub documentation.
