:context: self-service-rbac

Custom self-service templates that you set up in {SelfServiceShort} use a different set of RBAC rules than the RBAC rules for auto-generated self-service templates that are synchronized from {PlatformNameShort}.

* *Auto-generated self-service templates*: The RBAC settings for these templates are synchronized from {PlatformNameShort}.
* *Custom self-service templates*: You must set up RBAC for these templates in {SelfServiceShort}.
