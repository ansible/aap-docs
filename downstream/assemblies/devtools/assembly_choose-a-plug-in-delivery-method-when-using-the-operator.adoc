Ansible plug-ins for Red Hat Developer Hub support two delivery methods. Choose the method that fits your environment:
+
* **OCI container (recommended)**: Red Hat Developer Hub pulls the Ansible plug-ins directly from `registry.redhat.io` as OCI artifacts during startup.

* **HTTP plug-in registry**: Manually download the Ansible plug-ins tarball file and deploy an HTTP plug-in registry in your OpenShift cluster. Use this method if your environment cannot pull OCI artifacts from `registry.redhat.io`.

Complete one of the following procedures before configuring the dynamic plug-ins.
