The {ToolsName} are installed as part of the Ansible extension in the {AnsibleWorkspaceSing}.
You can use {ToolsName} to scaffold directories for automation content in your repository.
 
Using the Ansible extension ensures that best practices for directory structure are met.
For more information about using the Ansible extension to develop automation content, refer to {LinkDevelopAutomationContent}.

Red Hat recommends that you create only one collection per repository, so that each collection has a clear, specific purpose.
This approach promotes reusability, as each collection is a self-contained unit of content.
A one-to-one relationship between a collection and its repository also improves manageability by simplifying dependency management, maintenance, and release cycles.
