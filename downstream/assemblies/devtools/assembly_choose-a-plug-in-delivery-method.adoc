[role="_abstract"]
Ansible plug-ins for Red Hat Developer Hub support two delivery methods. Choose the method that fits your environment:

* **OCI container (recommended)**: Red Hat Developer Hub pulls the Ansible plug-ins directly from registry.redhat.io as OCI artifacts during startup. You do not need to use any manual file downloads or plug-in registry deployment.

* **HTTP plug-in registry**: Manually download the Ansible plug-ins tarball files, deploy an HTTP plug-in registry in your OpenShift cluster, and configure Red Hat Developer Hub to pull plug-ins from that registry. Use this method if your environment cannot pull OCI artifacts from `registry.redhat.io`.

Complete one of the following procedures before configuring the Ansible plug-ins in the Required configuration section.
