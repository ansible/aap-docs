= Authenticating to `hashicorp.terraform`

[role="_abstract"]

After you install or migrate to `hashicorp.terraform`, authentication is configured in the {PlatformNameShort} user interface. An administrator creates a custom credential type to authenticate to {Terraform}. Then users create credentials (based on the credential type) to use with job templates in {PlatformNameShort}.
