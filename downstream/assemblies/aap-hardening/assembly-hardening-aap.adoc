[role="_abstract"]
This guide takes a practical approach to hardening the {PlatformNameShort} security posture, starting with the planning and architecture phase of deployment and then covering specific guidance for the installation phase.  As this guide specifically covers {PlatformNameShort} running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), hardening guidance for RHEL will be covered where it affects the automation platform components.

This guide takes a practical approach to hardening the {PlatformNameShort} (AAP) security posture, starting with the planning and architecture phase of deployment and then covering specific guidance for the installation phase. As this guide specifically covers AAP running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), hardening guidance for RHEL will be covered where it affects the automation platform components.

* A bulleted list of links to other material closely related to the contents of the concept module.
* Currently, modules cannot include xrefs, so you cannot include links to other content in your collection. If you need to link to another assembly, add the xref to the assembly that includes this module.
