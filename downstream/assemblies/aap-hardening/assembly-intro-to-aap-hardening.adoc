= Introduction to hardening {PlatformNameShort}

[role="_abstract"]

This document provides guidance for improving the security posture (referred to as “hardening” throughout this guide) of your {PlatformName} deployment on {RHEL}.

The following are not currently within the scope of this guide:

* Other deployment targets for {PlatformNameShort}, such as OpenShift.
* {PlatformNameShort} managed services available through cloud service provider marketplaces.
//* Additional considerations with regards to the _Defense Information Systems Agency_ (DISA) _Security Technical Implementation Guides_ (STIGs)

[NOTE]
====
Hardening and compliance for {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 includes additional considerations with regards to the specific _Defense Security Information Agency_ (DISA) _Security Technical Implementation Guides_ (STIGs) for {ControllerName}, but this guidance does not apply to {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers}.
====

This guide takes a practical approach to hardening the {PlatformNameShort} security posture, starting with the planning and architecture phase of deployment and then covering specific guidance for installation, initial configuration, and day 2 operations. 
As this guide specifically covers {PlatformNameShort} running on {RHEL}, hardening guidance for {RHEL} will be covered where it affects the automation platform components. 
Additional considerations with regards to the DISA STIGs for {RHEL} are provided for those organizations that integrate the DISA STIGs as a part of their overall security strategy.

[NOTE]
====
These recommendations do not guarantee security or compliance of your deployment of {PlatformNameShort}. 
You must assess security from the unique requirements of your organization to address specific threats and risks and balance these against implementation factors.
