= Get a comprehensive visual overview of automation with reports

[role="_abstract"]
The reports feature on the {PlatformName} provides users with a visual overview of their automation efforts across different teams by using Ansible.

Each report helps users to monitor the status of their automation environment, be it the frequency of playbook runs or the status of hosts affected by various job templates.

For example, you can use your reports to:

* View the number of hosts affected by a job template
* View the number changes made to hosts by a job template
* View the frequency of a job template run, and the rate of job templates that succeed or fail to run
