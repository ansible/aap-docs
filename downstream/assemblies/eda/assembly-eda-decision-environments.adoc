= Decision environments

[role="_abstract"]
Decision environments are container images that run Ansible rulebooks. They create a common language for communicating automation dependencies, and give a standard way to build and distribute the automation environment. 

You can find the default decision environment in the link:https://quay.io/repository/ansible/ansible-rulebook[Ansible-Rulebook]. 

To create your own decision environment, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/using_automation_decisions/eda-decision-environments#eda-controller-install-builder[Installing ansible-builder] and link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/using_automation_decisions/eda-decision-environments#eda-build-a-custom-decision-environment[Building a custom decision environment for {EDAName} within {PlatformNameShort}].
