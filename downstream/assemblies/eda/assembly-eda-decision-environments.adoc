= Decision environments

Decision environments are a container image to run Ansible Rulebooks.
They create a common language for communicating automation dependencies, and give a standard way to build and distribute the automation environment.
You can find the default decision environment in the link:https://quay.io/repository/ansible/ansible-rulebook[Ansible-Rulebook]. 

To create your own decision environment, see xref:ref-eda-controller-install-builder[Install ansible-builder] and xref:eda-build-a-custom-decision-environment[Building a custom decision environment for Event-Driven Ansible within Ansible Automation Platform].
