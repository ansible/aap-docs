= Projects

Projects are a logical collection of rulebooks. 
They must be a git repository and only http protocol is supported. 
The rulebooks of a project must be located in the path defined for {EDAName} content in Ansible collections: `/extensions/eda/rulebooks` at the root of the project.

[NOTE]
====
* Do not link a project to an empty repository. Linking a project to an empty repository causes synchronization errors.
* When Redis is unavailable due to a failure, you will not be able to create or sync projects.
