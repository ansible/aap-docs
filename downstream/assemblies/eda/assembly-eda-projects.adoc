= Projects

Projects are a logical collection of rulebooks. 
They must be a git repository and only http protocol is supported. 
The rulebooks of a project must be located in the path defined for {EDAName} content in Ansible collections: `/extensions/eda/rulebooks` at the root of the project.

====
//(J. Self) Commenting this out until we can confirm it's no longer needed. Brought to our attention by developer Joe Shimkus. * Do not link a project to an empty repository. Linking a project to an empty repository causes synchronization errors.
To meet high availability demands, {EDAcontroller} shares centralized link:https://redis.io/[Redis (REmote DIctionary Server)] with the {PlatformNameShort} UI. When Redis is unavailable, you will not be able to create or sync projects.
