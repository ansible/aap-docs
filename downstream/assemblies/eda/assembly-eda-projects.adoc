Projects are a logical collection of rulebooks. They must be a git repository and located in the path defined for {EDAName} content in Ansible collections: `/extensions/eda/rulebooks` at the root of the project.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To meet high availability demands, {EDAcontroller} shares centralized link:https://redis.io/[Redis (REmote DIctionary Server)] with the {PlatformNameShort} UI. When Redis is unavailable, you will not be able to create or sync projects.
