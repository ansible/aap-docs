To meet high availability demands, {EDAcontroller} shares centralized link:https://redis.io/[Redis (REmote DIctionary Server)] with the {PlatformNameShort} UI. When Redis is unavailable due to failure, the following functions will not be available:

* Creating an activation, if `is_enabled` is True
* Deleting an activation
* Enabling an activation, if not already enabled
* Disabling an activation, if not already disabled
* Restarting an activation
