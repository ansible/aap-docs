= Setting up credentials for {EDAcontroller}

You can use credentials and credential types to define and store secrets that can be used for authentication purposes with resources, such as decision environments, rulebook activations and projects for {EDAcontroller}, and inventories and projects for {ControllerName}.

As a system administrator, you can define a custom credential type for each credential you create in a standard format by using a YAML or JSON-like definition.
