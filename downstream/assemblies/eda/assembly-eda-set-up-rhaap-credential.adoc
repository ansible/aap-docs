= {PlatformName} credential

When {EDAcontroller} is deployed on {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers}, you can create a {PlatformName} credential to connect to {ControllerName} through the use of an {ControllerName} URL and a username and password. After it has been created, you can attach the {PlatformName} credential to a rulebook and use it to run rulebook activations. These credentials provide a simple way to configure communication between {ControllerName} and {EDAcontroller}, enabling your rulebooks to launch jobs.

[NOTE]
====
If you deployed {EDAcontroller} with {PlatformNameShort} 2.4, you probably used controller tokens to connect {ControllerName} and {EDAcontroller}. These controller tokens have been deprecated in {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers}. See Replacing controller tokens in Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 for more information.
