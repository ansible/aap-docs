= Installation of {EDAcontroller}

Similar to the {ControllerName} and {HubName} components, the setup for {EDAcontroller} includes default settings for specific variables in the inventory files.  

[IMPORTANT]
====
{EDAcontroller} must be installed on a separate server and cannot be installed on the same host as {HubName} and {ControllerName}.
====

[NOTE]
====
If you are running {RHEL} 8 and want to set your memory limits, you must have cgroup v2 enabled before you install {EDAName}. For specific instructions, see the Knowledge-Centered Support (KCS) article, link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7054905[Ansible Automation Platform Event-Driven Ansible controller for {RHEL} 8 requires cgroupv2].
