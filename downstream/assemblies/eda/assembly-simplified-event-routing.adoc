= Simplified event routing

[role="_abstract"]
Simplified event routing provides {EDAcontroller} the capability to capture and analyze data from various remote systems (like GitHub or GitLab) using event streams. You can attach one or more event streams to an activation by swapping out sources in a rulebook. 

Event streams simplify connecting sources to rulebooks. This capability enables the creation of a single endpoint to receive alerts from an event source for utilization in multiple rulebooks.
