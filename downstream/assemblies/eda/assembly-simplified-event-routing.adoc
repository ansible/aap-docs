= Simplfied event routing

Simplified event routing enables {EDAcontroller} to capture and analyze data from various remote systems using event streams. Event streams allow you to send events from a remote system like GitHub or GitLab into Event-Driven Ansible controller. You can attach 1 or more event streams to an activation by swapping out sources in a rulebook. 

Event streams are an easy way to connect your sources to your rulebooks. This capability lets you create a single endpoint to receive alerts from an event source and then use the events in multiple rulebooks.
