= Simplified event routing

[role="_abstract"]
Simplified event routing enables {EDAcontroller} to capture and analyze data from various remote systems using event streams. With event streams, you can send events from a remote system like GitHub or GitLab into {EDAcontroller}. You can attach 1 or more event streams to an activation by swapping out sources in a rulebook. 

Event streams are an easy way to connect your sources to your rulebooks. This capability lets you create a single endpoint to receive alerts from an event source and then use the events in multiple rulebooks.
