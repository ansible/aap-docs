= Credentials

You can use credentials to store secrets that can be used for authentication purposes with resources, such as decision environments, rulebook activations and projects for {EDAcontroller}, and projects for {ControllerName}.

Credentials authenticate users when launching jobs against machines and importing project content from a version control system.

You can grant users and teams the ability to use these credentials without exposing the credential to the user. If a user moves to a different team or leaves the organization, you do not have to rekey all of your systems just because that credential was previously available.
