= Rulebook activations troubleshooting

[role="_abstract"]
Rulebook activations might occasionally fail due to various reasons. While many issues can be resolved through basic checks, diagnosing failures across a distributed system requires robust logging.

{EDAName}'s enhanced logging strategy includes the addition of unique tracking identifiers to all output to significantly improve troubleshooting.

Review the list of possible issues contained in this chapter that can cause activation failures and suggestions on how you can resolve them. For detailed log filtering using the new identifiers, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.6/html/using_automation_decisions/eda-rulebook-troubleshooting#eda-log-filtering[{EDAName} log filtering].
