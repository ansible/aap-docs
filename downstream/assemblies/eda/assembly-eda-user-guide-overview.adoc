= {EDAcontroller} overview

{EDAName} is a highly scalable, flexible automation capability that works with event sources such as other software vendors' monitoring tools. 
These tools monitor IT solutions and identify events and automatically implement the documented changes or response in a rulebook to handle that event.

The following procedures form the user configuration:

* xref:eda-credentials[Credentials]
* xref:eda-credential-types[Credential types]
* xref:eda-projects[Projects]
* xref:eda-decision-environments[Decision environments]
* xref:simplified-event-routing[Simplified event routing]
* xref:eda-set-up-rhaap-credential-type[Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform credential]
* xref:eda-rulebook-activations[Rulebook activations]
* xref:eda-rulebook-troubleshooting[Rulebook activations troubleshooting]
* xref:eda-rule-audit[Rule audit]
* xref:eda-performance-tuning[Performance tuning for {EDAcontroller}]
* xref:eda-event-filter-plugins[Event filter plugins]
* xref:eda-logging-strategy[Event-Driven Ansible logging strategy]


[NOTE]

====
* API documentation for {EDAcontroller} is available at \https://<platform-host>/api/eda/v1/docs
* To meet high availability demands, {EDAcontroller} shares centralized link:https://redis.io/[Redis (REmote DIctionary Server)] with the {PlatformNameShort} UI. When Redis is unavailable, you will not be able to create or sync projects, or enable rulebook activations.
