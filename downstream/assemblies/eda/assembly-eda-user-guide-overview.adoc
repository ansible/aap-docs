= {EDAcontroller} overview

{EDAName} is a highly scalable, flexible automation capability that works with event sources such as other software vendors' monitoring tools. 
These tools monitor IT solutions and identify events and automatically implement the documented changes or response in a rulebook to handle that event.

The following procedures form the user configuration:

* xref:eda-set-up-credential[Setting up credentials]
* xref:eda-set-up-new-project[Setting up a new project]
* xref:eda-set-up-new-decision-environment[Setting up a new decision environment]
//* xref:eda-set-up-token[Setting up a token to authenticate to {PlatformNameShort} Controller]
* xref:eda-set-up-rulebook-activation[Setting up a rulebook activation]
* xref:eda-performance-tuning[Performance tuning for EDAcontroller]

[NOTE]

====
* API documentation for {EDAcontroller} is available at \https://<eda-server-host>/api/eda/v1/docs
* To meet high availability demands, {EDAcontroller} shares centralized link:https://redis.io/[Redis (REmote DIctionary Server)] with the {PlatformNameShort} UI. When Redis is unavailable, you will not be able to create or sync projects, or enable rulebook activations.
