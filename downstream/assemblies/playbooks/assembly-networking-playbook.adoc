= Gather and display network device info with a playbook 

[role="_abstract"]
Learn how to create and run a simple Ansible Playbook that connects to a network device, gathers facts, and displays them.

To confirm your credentials, you can connect to a network device manually and retrieve its configuration. Replace the sample user and device name with your real credentials. 

For example, for a VyOS router:

----
ssh my_vyos_user@vyos.example.net
show config
exit
----
