= Introduction

An Ansible Playbook is a blueprint for automation tasks, which are actions executed with limited manual effort across an inventory of solutions. 
Playbooks tell Ansible what to do on which devices.
Instead of manually applying the same action to hundreds or thousands of similar technologies across IT environments, executing a playbook automatically completes the same action for the specified type of inventory—such as a set of routers. 

Playbooks are regularly used to automate IT infrastructure—such as operating systems and Kubernetes platforms—networks, security systems, and code repositories like GitHub.
You can use playbooks to program applications, services, server nodes, and other devices, without the manual overhead of creating everything from scratch.
Playbooks, and the conditions, variables, and tasks within them, can be saved, shared, or reused indefinitely. 
This makes it easier for you to codify operational knowledge and ensure that the same actions are performed consistently.
