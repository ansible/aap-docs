[role="_abstract"]
An Ansible Playbook is a blueprint for automation tasks, which are actions executed with limited manual effort across an inventory of solutions. 
Playbooks tell Ansible what to do on which devices.

A playbook automatically executes the same action across a specified inventory type, such as a set of routers, replacing manual repetitive work.

Playbooks are regularly used to automate IT infrastructure, such as operating systems, Kubernetes platforms, networks, security systems, and code repositories such as GitHub.

You can use playbooks to program applications, services, server nodes, and other devices, without the effort of creating everything from scratch.
Playbooks, and the conditions, variables, and tasks within them, can be saved, shared, or reused indefinitely. 
This makes it easier for you to codify operational knowledge and ensure that the same actions are performed consistently.
