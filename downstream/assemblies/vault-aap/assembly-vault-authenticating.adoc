= Authenticating to `hashicorp.vault`

Before you can use the `hashicorp.vault integration`, authentication must be configured in the {PlatformName} user interface:

* An administrator must create a custom credential type to authenticate to Vault.
* Users must create credentials (based on the credential type) to use with job templates in Ansible Automation Platform.
