= Authenticating to `hashicorp.vault`

After you install or migrate to the `hashicorp.vault` collection, authentication is configured in the {PlatformNameShort} user interface:

* An administrator creates a custom credential type to authenticate to {Vault}.

* Users create credentials (based on the credential type) to use with job templates in {PlatformNameShort}.
