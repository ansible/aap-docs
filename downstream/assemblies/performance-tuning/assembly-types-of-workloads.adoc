This guide offers insights on enabling performance tuning for your {PlatformNameShort} deployment. It covers the following topics:

* The types of workloads and the components these workloads rely on to perform well
* The services each workload uses
* Reference workloads supported by the tested deployment models
* Reasons for scaling each service beyond the base configurations of the tested deployment models
