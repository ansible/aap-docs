* Currently, modules cannot include xrefs, so you cannot include links to other content in your collection. If you need to link to another assembly, add the xref to the assembly that includes this module.
* For more details on writing concept modules, see the link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs#modular-documentation-reference-guide[Modular Documentation Reference Guide].
