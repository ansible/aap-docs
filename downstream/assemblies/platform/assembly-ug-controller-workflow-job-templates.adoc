= Workflow job templates

:context: worklow-job-templates

[role="_abstract"]
A workflow job template links together a sequence of disparate resources that tracks the full set of jobs that were part of the release process as a single unit. 

These resources include the following:

* Job templates
* Workflow job templates
* Project syncs
* Inventory source syncs

You can create both Job templates and Workflow job templates from {MenuAETemplates}.

For Job templates, see xref:controller-job-templates[Job templates].

The *Automation Templates* page shows the workflow and job templates that are currently available. 

//The default view is to show each template as a card, showing the template name and template type. 

Select the template name to display more information about the template, including when it  last ran.
This list is sorted alphabetically by name, but you can sort by other criteria, or search by various fields and attributes of a template.

From this screen you can launch image:rightrocket.png[Launch icon,15,15] , edit image:leftpencil.png[Edit icon,15,15], and duplicate image:copy.png[Duplicate icon, 15,15] a workflow job template.

//From the template card you can launch image:rightrocket.png[Launch,15,15], edit image:leftpencil.png[Leftpencil,15,15] a template, or, using the {MoreActionsIcon} icon, you can duplicate image:copy.png[Duplicate,15,15] or delete image:delete-button.png[Delete,15,15]a template.

Only workflow templates have the workflow visualizer image:visualizer.png[Workflow visualizer,15,15] icon as a shortcut for accessing the workflow editor.

[NOTE]
====
Workflow templates can be used as building blocks for another workflow template. 
You can enable *Prompt on Launch* by setting up several settings in a workflow template, which you can edit at the workflow job template level.
These do not affect the values assigned at the individual workflow template level. 
For further instructions, see the xref:controller-workflow-visualizer[Workflow visualizer] section.
