= Infrastructure changes by deployment type

[role="_abstract"]
You can review the infrastructure changes required when upgrading to {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers}. The infrastructure changes vary depending on your current version, deployment method, and target topology.

* RPM and Operator-based deployments: Upgrade directly from version 2.4 or 2.5 to {PlatformVers}
* Container-based deployments: Upgrade from version 2.5 to {PlatformVers} (upgrades from 2.4 are not supported)

Each deployment type section includes topology diagrams, infrastructure requirements, and configuration examples to help you plan your upgrade.
