= Tested deployment model upgrades for RPM installations

[role="_abstract"]
There are additional requirements for both {GrowthTopology} and {EnterpriseTopology} when upgrading to {PlatformNameShort} version {PlatformVers}. Red Hat has tested and recommends the following scenarios for RPM-based deployments:

* 2.4 single {ControllerName} node deployment to a {PlatformVers} {GrowthTopology}
* 2.4 single node {ControllerName} and {HubName} deployment to a {PlatformVers} {GrowthTopology}
* 2.4 multi node {ControllerName} deployment to a {PlatformVers} {EnterpriseTopology}
* 2.4 multi node {ControllerName} and {HubName} deployment to a {PlatformVers} {EnterpriseTopology}
