= Project Signing and Verification

Project signing and verification lets you sign files in your project directory and then verify whether or not that content has
changed in any way, or files have been added or removed from the project unexpectedly. 
To accomplish this, a private key for signing and a matching public key for verifying are needed.

For project maintainers, the supported way to perform content signing is to use the `ansible-sign` utility, through the _command-line
interface_ (CLI) that comes with it.

The CLI aims to make it easy to use cryptographic technology such as _GNU Privacy Guard_ (GPG) to validate that specified files within a project have not been tampered with in any way. 
Currently, GPG is the only supported means of signing and validation.

{ControllerNameStart} is used to verify the signed content. 
After a matching public key has been associated with the signed project, {ControllerName} verifies that the files included during signing have not changed, and that files have been added or removed unexpectedly. 
If the signature is not valid or a file has changed, the project fails to update, and no jobs making use of the project can launch. Verification status of the project ensures that only secure, untampered content is run in jobs.

Assuming that the repository has already been configured for signing and verification, the usual workflow for altering the project becomes the following:

. The user has a project repository set up already and wants to make a change to a file.
. The user makes the change, and runs the following command:
+
[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
ansible-sign project gpg-sign /path/to/project
----
+
which updates a checksum manifest and signs it.
. The user commits the change and the updated checksum manifest and the signature to the repository.
. When the user synchronizes the project, {ControllerName} (already configured in this scenario) pulls in the new changes, checks that the public key associated with the project in {ControllerName} matches the private key that the checksum manifest was signed with (this prevents tampering with the checksum manifest itself), then re-calculates the checksums of each file in the manifest to ensure that the checksum matches (and thus that no file has changed). It also ensures that all files are accounted for: 

They must have been either included in, or excluded from, the `MANIFEST.in` file discussed below. 
If files have been added or removed unexpectedly, verification will fail.
