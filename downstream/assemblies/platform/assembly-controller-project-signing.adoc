= Project Signing and Verification

[role="_abstract"]
Use project signing and verification in your project directory to sign files. You can then verify whether or not that content has changed in any way, or files have been added to, or removed from the project unexpectedly. 
To do this, you require a private key for signing and a matching public key for verifying.
