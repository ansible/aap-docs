= Support matrix for upgrade scenarios

Determine which upgrade paths are supported for your current {PlatformNameShort} deployment. The following reference tables show RHEL version compatibility and give step-by-step upgrade processes organized by deployment type: RPM-based, container-based, and {OCPShort} deployments.

[NOTE]
====
In-place upgrades of major RHEL versions are not supported. You must migrate your existing deployment of {PlatformNameShort} to a new RHEL environment.
