= Configuring {ControllerName} on {OCP} web console

:context: installing-controller-operator

[role="_abstract"]

You can use these instructions to configure the {ControllerName} operator on {OCP}, specify custom resources, and deploy {PlatformNameShort} with an external database.

{ControllerNameStart} configuration can be done through the {ControllerName} extra_settings or directly in the user interface after deployment. However, it is important to note that configurations made in extra_settings take precedence over settings made in the user interface.

[NOTE]
====
When an instance of {ControllerName} is removed, the associated PVCs are not automatically deleted. This can cause issues during migration if the new deployment has the same name as the previous one. Therefore, it is recommended that you manually remove old PVCs before deploying a new {ControllerName} instance in the same namespace. See link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html-single/installing_on_openshift_container_platform/index#proc-find-delete-PVCs_installing-controller-operator[Finding and deleting PVCs] for more information.

// mirrors AWX operator flow

== Prerequisites

* You have installed the {PlatformName} catalog in Operator Hub.
* For {ControllerName}, a default StorageClass must be configured on the cluster for the operator to dynamically create needed PVCs. This is not necessary if an external PostgreSQL database is configured.
* For Hub a StorageClass that supports ReadWriteMany must be available on the cluster to dynamically created the PVC needed for the content, redis and api pods. If it is not the default StorageClass on the cluster, you can specify it when creating your AutomationHub object.
