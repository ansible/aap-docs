= Execution Environment Setup Reference

[role="_abstract"]
You define the content of your {ExecEnvShort} in a YAML file. 
By default, this file is called `execution_environment.yml`. 
This file tells {Builder} how to create the build instruction file (Containerfile for Podman, Dockerfile for Docker) and build context for your container image.

[NOTE]
====
The definition schema for {Builder} 3.x is documented here. 
If you are running an older version of {Builder}, you need an older schema version. 
For more information, see older versions of link:https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/builder/en/latest/[this] documentation. 
We recommend using version 3, which offers substantially more configurable options and functionality than previous versions.
