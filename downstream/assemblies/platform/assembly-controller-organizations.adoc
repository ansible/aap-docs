An organization is a logical collection of users, teams, and resources. It is the highest level object in the {PlatformNameShort} object hierarchy. After you have created an organization, {PlatformNameShort} displays the organization details. You can then manage access and execution environments for the organization.
{PlatformNameShort} automatically creates a default organization and the system administrator is automatically assigned to this organization. If you have a Self-support level license, you have only the default organization available and must not delete it.

// [ddacosta] Removed this statement because I think it was relevant when this content was upstream but in the downstream docs, it’s implied that you have a license.
//[NOTE]
//====
//Only Enterprise or Premium licenses can add new organizations.
//====
//Enterprise and Premium license users who want to add a new organization should refer to the xref:proc-controller-create-organization[Creating an organization].
