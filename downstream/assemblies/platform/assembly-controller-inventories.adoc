An inventory is a collection of hosts managed by {ControllerName}. 
Organizations are assigned to inventories, while permissions to launch playbooks against inventories are controlled at the user or team level.

{PlatformName} works against a list of managed nodes or hosts in your infrastructure that are logically organized, using an inventory file.
You can use the {PlatformName} installer inventory file to specify your installation scenario and describe host deployments to Ansible.
By using an inventory file, Ansible can manage a large number of hosts with a single command.
Inventories also help you use Ansible more efficiently by reducing the number of command line options you have to specify.
Inventories are divided into groups and these groups contain the hosts.

Groups may be sourced manually, by entering host names into {ControllerName}, or from one of its supported cloud providers.

[NOTE]
====
If you have a custom dynamic inventory script, or a cloud provider that is not yet supported natively in {ControllerName}, you can also import that into {ControllerName}. 

For more information, see link:https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/4.4/html/administration/scm-inv-source.html#ag-inv-import[Inventory file importing] in the _{ControllerAG}_.

From the navigation panel, select menu:Resources[Inventories].
The *Inventories* window displays a list of the inventories that are currently available. 
You can sort the inventory list by *Name*, *Type*, or *Organization*.
//Can't see how you search for these: description, owners and modifiers of the inventory, or additional criteria as needed.

The *Inventory details* page includes:

* *Name*: The inventory name.
// You can also reach this page using the image:leftpencil.png[Edit,15,15] icon. No you can't.
* *Status*

The statuses are:

** *Success*: When the inventory source sync completed successfully
** *Disabled*: No inventory source added to the inventory
** *Error*: When the inventory source sync completed with error
* *Type*: Identifies whether it is a standard inventory, a Smart inventory, or a constructed inventory.
* *Organization*: The organization to which the inventory belongs.
* *Actions*: The following actions are available for the selected inventory:
** *Edit* image:leftpencil.png[Edit,15,15]: Edit the properties for the selected inventory
** *Copy* image:copy.png[Copy,15,15]: Makes a copy of an existing inventory as a template for creating a new one

Click the Inventory name to display the *Details* page for the selected inventory, which shows the
inventory's groups and hosts.

//Smart inventories are deprecated.
