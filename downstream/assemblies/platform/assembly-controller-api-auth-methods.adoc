[role="_abstract"]
{ControllerNameStart} is designed for organizations to control their automation with a visual dashboard for out-of-the box control while providing a REST API to integrate with your other tools on a deeper level. 

{ControllerNameStart} supports several authentication methods to make it easy to embed {ControllerName} into existing tools and processes. 
This ensures that the right people can access its resources.

You can use the following authentication methods in the API:

* xref:controller-api-session-auth[Session authentication]
* xref:controller-api-basic-auth[Basic authentication]
* xref:controller-api-oauth2-token[OAuth 2 token authentication]
* xref:controller-api-sso-auth[Single sign-on authentication]
