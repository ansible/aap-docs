A *Team* is a subdivision of an organization with associated users, projects, credentials, and permissions. 
Teams provide a means to implement role-based access control schemes and delegate responsibilities across organizations. 
For instance, you can grant permissions to a whole Team rather than each user on the Team.

You can create as many Teams of users as make sense for your Organization. 
Each Team can be assigned permissions, just as with Users.
Teams can also scalably assign ownership for credentials, preventing multiple interface click-throughs to assign the same credentials to the same user.

From the navigation panel, select menu:Access[Teams].

The team list may be sorted and searched by *Name* or *Organization*.

Click the Edit image:leftpencil.png[Edit,15,15] icon next to the entry to edit information about the team.
You can also review *Users* and *Permissions* associated with this Team.
