= Managing teams

A *Team* is a subdivision of an organization with associated users, projects, credentials, and permissions.
Teams offer a means to implement role-based access control schemes and delegate responsibilities across organizations.
For example, you can grant permissions to a whole team rather than to each user on the team.

From the navigation panel, select {MenuControllerTeams}.

You can sort and search the team list and searched by *Name* or *Organization*.

Click the Edit image:leftpencil.png[Edit,15,15] icon next to the entry to edit information about the team.
You can also review *Users* and *Permissions* associated with this team.
