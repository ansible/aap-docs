As an administrator, you can use teams to bulk-assign roles to users that need to share the same access. 

A team is a subdivision of an organization that groups users and roles together for specific resources.
Teams provide a means to implement role-based access control schemes and delegate responsibilities across organizations by allowing you to grant access to users in bulk. 
For example, you can grant resource access to a team, and therefore to all the users in the team, rather than granting access to each individual user on the team.

You can create as many teams as needed for your organization. 
Teams can only be assigned to one organization while an organization can be made up of multiple teams. 
Each team can be assigned roles, the same way roles are assigned for users. 
Teams can also scalably assign ownership for credentials, preventing multiple interface click-throughs to assign the same credentials to the same user.
