//= Managing credentials


//Credentials authenticate the controller user to launch Ansible playbooks. The passwords and SSH keys are used to authenticate against inventory hosts. 
//By using the credentials feature of {ControllerName}, you can require the {ControllerName} user to enter a password or key phrase when a playbook launches.

= Managing user credentials

Credentials authenticate the {ControllerName} user when launching jobs against machines, synchronizing with inventory sources, and importing project content from a version control system.

You can grant users and teams the ability to use these credentials, without exposing the credential to the user. 
If a user moves to a different team or leaves the organization, you do not have to re-key all of your systems just because that credential was available in {ControllerName}.

[NOTE]
====
{ControllerNameStart} encrypts passwords and key information in the database and never makes secret information visible through the API. 
For further information, see link:{URLControllerAdminGuide}[_{ControllerAG}_].
====

== How credentials work
{ControllerNameStart} uses SSH to connect to remote hosts. 
To pass the key from {ControllerName} to SSH, the key must be decrypted before it can be written to a named pipe. 
{ControllerNameStart} uses that pipe to send the key to SSH, so that the key is never written to disk.
If passwords are used, {ControllerName} handles them by responding directly to the password prompt and decrypting the password before writing it to the prompt.

The *Credentials* page shows credentials that are currently available. 
The default view is collapsed (Compact), showing the credential name, and credential type.
From this screen you can edit image:leftpencil.png[Edit,15,15], duplicate image:copy.png[Copy,15,15] or delete {MoreActionsIcon} a credential.

[NOTE]
====
It is possible to create duplicate credentials with the same name and without an organization. 
However, it is not possible to create two duplicate credentials in the same organization.

.Example

. Create two machine credentials with the same name but without an organization.
. Use the module `ansible.controller.export` to export the credentials.
. Use the module `ansible.controller.import` in a different automation execution node.
. Check the imported credentials.

When you export two duplicate credentials and then import them in a different node, only one credential is imported.
