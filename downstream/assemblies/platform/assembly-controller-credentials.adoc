= Managing user credentials

[role="_abstract"]
Credentials authenticate the {ControllerName} user when launching jobs against machines, synchronizing with inventory sources, and importing project content from a version control system.

You can grant users and teams the ability to use these credentials, without exposing the credential to the user. 
If a user moves to a different team or leaves the organization, you do not have to re-key all of your systems just because that credential was available in {ControllerName}.

[NOTE]
====
{ControllerNameStart} encrypts passwords and key information in the database and never makes secret information visible through the API. 
For further information, see link:{URLControllerAdminGuide}[_{ControllerAG}_].
