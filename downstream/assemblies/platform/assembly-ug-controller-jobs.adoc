= Jobs in {ControllerName}

A job is an instance of {ControllerName} launching an Ansible playbook against an inventory of hosts.

The *Jobs* list view displays a list of jobs and their statuses, shown as completed successfully, failed, or as an active (running) job. 
The default view is collapsed (Compact) with the job name, status, job type, start, and finish times. 
You can click the arrow image:arrow.png[Arrow,15,15] icon to expand and see more information. 
You can sort this list by various criteria, and perform a search to filter the jobs of interest.

From this screen you can complete the following tasks:

* View details and standard output of a particular job 
* Re-launch image:rightrocket.png[Launch,15,15] jobs
* Remove selected jobs

The relaunch operation only applies to relaunches of playbook runs and does not apply to project or inventory updates, system jobs, and workflow jobs.
When a job relaunches, the *Jobs Output* view is displayed.
Selecting any type of job also takes you to the *Job Output* view for that job, where you can filter jobs by various criteria:

* The *Stdout* option is the default display that shows the job processes and output.
* The *Event* option enables you to filter by the events of interest, such as errors, host failures, host retries, and items skipped. 
You can include as many events in the filter as necessary.
* The *Advanced* option is a refined search that gives you a combination of including or excluding criteria, searching by key, or by lookup type. 
For more information on using the search, refer to the xref:assembly-controller-search[Search] section.
