= Mapping

To control which users are allowed into the {PlatformNameShort} server, and placed into {PlatformNameShort} organizations or teams based on their attributes (such as username and email address) or what groups they belong to, you can configure authenticator maps. 

Use authenticator maps to add conditions that must be met before a user is given or denied access to a resource type. 
Authenticator maps are associated with an authenticator and are given an order. 
The maps are processed in order when the user logs in. 
This is similar to firewall rules or mail filters.
