= Clustering

Clustering is sharing load between hosts. 
Each instance must be able to act as an entry point for UI and API access. 
This must enable the {ControllerName} administrators to use load balancers in front of as many instances as they want and keep good data visibility.

[NOTE]
====
Load balancing is optional, and it is entirely possible to have ingress on one or all instances as needed.
====

Each instance must be able to join the {ControllerName} cluster and expand its ability to run jobs. 
This is a simple system where jobs can run anywhere rather than be directed on where to run. 
Also, you can group clustered instances into different pools or queues, called link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/automation_controller_user_guide/controller-instance-groups[Instance groups] as described in _{ControllerUG}_.

{PlatformNameShort} supports container-based clusters by using Kubernetes, meaning you can install new {ControllerName} instances on this platform without any variation or diversion in functionality. 
You can create instance groups to point to a Kubernetes container. 
For more information, see the link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/automation_controller_user_guide/controller-instance-and-container-groups[Container and instance groups] section in _{ControllerUG}_.

.Supported operating systems

The following operating systems are supported for establishing a clustered environment:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 or later 

[NOTE]
====
Isolated instances are not supported in conjunction with running automation controller in OpenShift.
