= Configuring access to external applications with token-based authentication

Token-based authentication permits authentication of third-party tools and services with the platform through integrated OAuth 2 token support. {PlatformNameShort} utilizes both OAuth Tokens and Personal Access Tokens (PATs). 

OAuth Tokens:: OAuth Tokens are tied to specific applications and allow applications to access data without disclosing user login information.

Personal Access Tokens:: PATs are personal to a user and not tied to a specific application. They are created directly by a user for their own use.

The default expiration for access tokens has been updated from 1000 years to 1 year. This change ensures frequent token rotation for increased credential security. 

[NOTE]
====
Access tokens in controller 2.4 and previous versions of the platform gateway were valid for 1000 years. Any existing tokens created prior to the 2.5.20250604 patch release will retain a 1000 year expiration. 
====

You can customize this setting to meet your specific requirements by modifying the expiration time in your `settings.py` file as follows: 

----
OAUTH2_PROVIDER__ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_SECONDS = 31536000
----

For more information on the `settings.py` file and how it can be used to configure aspects of the platform, see link:{URLAAPOperationsGuide}/aap-advanced-config#settings-py_advanced-config[`settings.py`] in {TitleAAPOperationsGuide}. 

For more information on the OAuth2 specification, see link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749[The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework].
