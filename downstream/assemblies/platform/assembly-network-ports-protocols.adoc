= Network ports and protocols

[role="_abstract"]

{PlatformName} uses several ports to communicate with its services. These ports must be open and available for incoming connections to the {PlatformName} server in order for it to work. Ensure that these ports are available and are not blocked by the server firewall.

The following architectural diagram is an example of a fully deployed {PlatformNameShort} with all possible components.

[NOTE]
====
In some of the following use cases, hop nodes are used instead of a direct link from an execution node. Hop nodes are an option for connecting control and execution nodes. Hop nodes use minimal CPU and memory, so vertically scaling hop nodes does not impact system capacity.

.{PlatformNameShort} Network ports and protocols 
image::aap-network-ports-protocols.png[Interaction of Ansible Automation Platform components on the network with information about the ports and protocols that are used.]

The following table indicates the destination port and the direction of network traffic:

[NOTE]
The following default destination ports and installer inventory listed are configurable. If you choose to configure them to suit your environment, you might experience a change in behavior.

| 22 | TCP | SSH | Installer node | PostgreSQL database| Remote access during installation (temporary) | `pg_port`
| 80/443 | TCP | HTTP/HTTPS | Installer node | {HubNameStart} | Allows installer node to push the execution environment image to {HubName} when using the bundle installer. | Fixed value
| 80/443 | TCP | HTTP/HTTPS | Execution node | {HubNameStart} | Allows execution nodes to pull the execution environment image from {HubName}. | Fixed value
| 443 | TCP | HTTPS | Controller node | Client | Web UI/API

This exposes the mesh ingress receptor entry point for inbound connections.| `nginx_https_port`
| 443 | TCP | HTTPS | Controller node | {OCPShort} |  Only required when using container groups to run jobs. | Host name of OpenShift API server
| 5432 | TCP | PostgreSQL | Controller node | PostgreSQL database | Open only if the internal database is used along with another component. Otherwise, this port should not be open. | `automationcontroller_pg_port`
| 5432 | TCP | PostgreSQL | EDA node | PostgreSQL database | Open only if the internal database is used along with another component. Otherwise, this port should not be open. | `automationedacontroller_pg_port`
| 5432 | TCP | PostgreSQL | {HubNameStart} | PostgreSQL database | Open only if the internal database is used along with another component. Otherwise, this port should not be open. | `automationhub_pg_port`
| 27199 | TCP | Receptor | Controller node | Execution node | Configurable

Mesh nodes directly peered to controllers. 

Direct nodes involved. 
27199 communication can be both ways (depending on installation inventory) for execution nodes
| `receptor_listener_port`

`peers`
| 27199 | TCP | Receptor | Controller node | Hop node | Configurable

ENABLE connections from hop nodes to Receptor port if relayed through hop nodes. | `receptor_listener_port`

`peers`
| 27199 | TCP | Receptor | Controller node | Hybrid node | Configurable

ENABLE connections from controllers to Receptor port if relayed through non-hop connected nodes. | `receptor_listener_port`

`peers`
| 27199 | TCP | Receptor | Execution node | Hop node | Configurable

Mesh 27199 communication can be both ways (depending on installation inventory) for execution nodes

ALLOW connection from controller(s) to Receptor port |
`receptor_listener_port`

`peers`
| 27199 | TCP | Receptor | Execution node | Controller node | Configurable

Mesh 27199 communication can be both ways (depending on installation inventory) for execution nodes

ALLOW connection from controller(s) to Receptor port |
`receptor_listener_port`

`peers`
|===

[NOTE]
====
* Hybrid nodes act as a combination of control and execution nodes, and therefore Hybrid nodes share the connections of both. 

* If `receptor_listener_port` is defined, the machine also requires an available open port on which to establish inbound TCP connections, for example, 27199.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Image manifests and filesystem blobs are served directly from `registry.redhat.io`.
However, from 1 May 2023, filesystem blobs are served from `quay.io` instead.
To avoid problems pulling container images, you must enable outbound connections to the listed `quay.io` hostnames.

This change should be made to any firewall configuration that specifically enables outbound connections to `registry.redhat.io`.

Use the hostnames instead of IP addresses when configuring firewall rules.

After making this change, you can continue to pull images from `registry.redhat.io`.
You do not require a `quay.io` login, or need to interact with the `quay.io` registry directly in any way to continue pulling Red Hat container images.

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6999582[Firewall changes for container image pulls].
