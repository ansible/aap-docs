= Network ports and protocols

[role="_abstract"]

{PlatformName} uses several ports to communicate with its services. These ports must be open and available for incoming connections to the {PlatformName} server in order for it to work. Ensure that these ports are available and are not blocked by the server firewall.

The following architectural diagram is an example of a fully deployed {PlatformNameShort} with all possible components.

[NOTE]
====
In some of the following use cases, hop nodes are used instead of a direct link from an execution node. Hop nodes are an option for connecting control and execution nodes. Hop nodes use minimal CPU and memory, so vertically scaling hop nodes does not impact system capacity.

The following table indicates the destination port and the direction of network traffic:

[NOTE]
The following default destination ports and installer inventory listed are configurable. If you choose to configure them to suit your environment, you might experience a change in behavior.

[NOTE]
====
* Hybrid nodes act as a combination of control and execution nodes, and therefore Hybrid nodes share the connections of both. 

* If `receptor_listener_port` is defined, the machine also requires an available open port on which to establish inbound TCP connections, for example, 27199.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Image manifests and filesystem blobs are served directly from `registry.redhat.io`.
However, from 1 May 2023, filesystem blobs are served from `quay.io` instead.
To avoid problems pulling container images, you must enable outbound connections to the listed `quay.io` hostnames.

This change should be made to any firewall configuration that specifically enables outbound connections to `registry.redhat.io`.

Use the hostnames instead of IP addresses when configuring firewall rules.

After making this change, you can continue to pull images from `registry.redhat.io`.
You do not require a `quay.io` login, or need to interact with the `quay.io` registry directly in any way to continue pulling Red Hat container images.

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6999582[Firewall changes for container image pulls].
