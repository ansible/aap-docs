= Usage reporting with metrics-utility

The {PlatformNameShort} metrics utility tool (`metrics-utility`) is a command-line utility that is installed on a system containing an instance of {ControllerName}. 

When installed and configured, `metrics-utility` gathers billing-related metrics from your system and creates a consumption-based billing report. Metrics-utility is especially suited for users who have multiple managed hosts and want to use consumption-based billing. Once a report is generated, it is deposited in a target location that you specify in the configuration file. 

Metrics-utility collects two types of data from your system: configuration data and reporting data. 

The configuration data includes the following information:

* Version information for {ControllerName} and for the operating system 
* Subscription information
* The base URL

The reporting data includes the following information:

* Job name and ID
* Host name
* Inventory name 
* Organization name 
* Project name 
* Success or failure information
* Report date and time

To ensure that `metrics-utility` continues to work as configured, clear your report directories of outdated reports regularly.
