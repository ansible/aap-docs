= Logging and Aggregation

Logging provides the capability to send detailed logs to third-party external log aggregation services.
Services connected to this data feed serve as a means of gaining insight into {ControllerName} use or technical trends. 
The data can be used to analyze events in the infrastructure, monitor for anomalies, and correlate events in one service with events in another. 

The types of data that are most useful to {ControllerName} are job fact data, job events or job runs, activity stream data, and log messages. 
The data is sent in JSON format over a HTTP connection using minimal service-specific adjustments engineered in a custom handler or through an imported library.

The version of `rsyslog` that is installed by {ControllerName} does not include the following `rsyslog` modules:

* rsyslog-udpspoof.x86_64
* rsyslog-libdbi.x86_64

After installing {ControllerName}, you must only use the {ControllerName} provided `rsyslog` package for any logging outside of {ControllerName} that might have previously been done with the RHEL provided `rsyslog` package. 

If you already use `rsyslog` for logging system logs on the {ControllerName} instances, you can continue to use `rsyslog` to handle logs from outside of {ControllerName} by running a separate `rsyslog` process (using the same version of rsyslog that {ControllerName} uses), and pointing it to a separate `/etc/rsyslog.conf` file.

Use the `/api/v2/settings/logging/` endpoint to configure how the {ControllerName} `rsyslog` process handles messages that have not yet been sent in the event that your external logger goes offline:

* `LOG_AGGREGATOR_MAX_DISK_USAGE_GB`: Specifies the amount of data to store (in gigabytes) during an outage of the external log aggregator (defaults to 1). 
Equivalent to the `rsyslogd queue.maxdiskspace` setting.
* `LOG_AGGREGATOR_MAX_DISK_USAGE_PATH`: Specifies the location to store logs that should be retried after an outage of the external log aggregator (defaults to `/var/lib/awx`). 
Equivalent to the `rsyslogd queue.spoolDirectory` setting.

For example, if `Splunk` goes offline, `rsyslogd` stores a queue on the disk until `Splunk` comes back online. 
By default, it stores up to 1GB of events (while Splunk is offline) but you can increase that to more than 1GB if necessary, or change the path where you save the queue.
