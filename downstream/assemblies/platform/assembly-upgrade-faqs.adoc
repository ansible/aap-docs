What are the supported installation topologies and operating systems for {PlatformNameShort} 2.6?::
Red Hat has adopted a more definitive approach to installation topologies, categorizing them as "growth" or  "enterprise" for production-ready setups:

* Growth topology: is intended for organizations that are getting started with {PlatformNameShort} and do not require redundancy or higher compute for large volumes of automation.
* Enterprise topology: is intended for organizations that require {PlatformNameShort} to be deployed with redundancy or higher compute for large volumes of automation. 

For more information, see link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/tested_deployment_models/index[Tested deployment models].

Which {RHEL} versions are supported for RPM and containerized installations?::
RPM installations will continue to be supported exclusively on {RHEL} 9. 
Containerized installations support both {RHEL} 9.4 or later versions of {RHEL} 9 and {RHEL} 10 or later versions of {RHEL} 10 for enterprise topologies.

What is the difference between "upgrade" and "migration" in {PlatformNameShort} 2.6?::
An upgrade is an application action, such as updating {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 to 2.6. 
A migration involves moving data, such as from an RPM-based 2.6 installation to a container-based 2.6 installation. 
New service components are not explicitly required between versions 2.5 and 2.6.

Can I upgrade from 2.4 to 2.6 or must I upgrade to 2.5 first?::
Yes you can upgrade directly to 2.6. 
However note that there may be new system requirements you must update before upgrading. 

How will managed cloud customers be upgraded to {PlatformNameShort} 2.6?::
All managed cloud customers on {Azure} and {AWS} will be upgraded to 2.6. 
Two upgrade window options will be available following the platform upgrade: non-production or production environments.
Communications will be ongoing from mid-July until late September.

Will migrations be fully supported in {PlatformNameShort} 2.6?::
Yes, migrations are fully supported, enabling customers to transition from RPM installations to containerized or {OCPShort} environments, or to the managed offering. 
Customers must be on the latest version of {PlatformNameShort} for their current installation prior to migrating. 
The installer will manage new components introduced in version 2.5 for direct 2.4 to 2.6 upgrades.


When upgrading from 2.4 to 2.6 (applies only to RPM or {OCPShort}), what is different about the upgrade process compared with the 2.4 to 2.5 process?::
See the link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html-single/planning_your_upgrade/index#con-upgrade-improvements-overview[Overview of upgrade improvements] section.

Iâ€™m using {EDAName} in 2.4, can I upgrade {EDAName} to 2.6?::
If you are using {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 with the technical preview of {EDAcontroller} but want to upgrade to the {PlatformNameShort} 2.6 with {EDAName}, you must install a new instance of {PlatformNameShort} 2.6 and manually re-create your {EDAName} configurations in the new, fully integrated environment.

Will my existing 2.4 or 2.5 OAuth Applications/Tokens, Credentials/Customer Credentials, and Personal Access Tokens still work after upgrading to 2.6?::
For upgrades from {PlatformNameShort}  2.4 or 2.5 to {PlatformNameShort}  2.6, some manual configuration is required:
* OAuth applications:
** {ControllerNameStart}: You can view and edit existing {ControllerName} applications, but you cannot create new ones. They still function, but they might be removed in a future release. You should plan to migrate to platform OAuth applications.
** {PlatformNameShort}: Platform OAuth applications provide an updated interface and are the standard for future use. You will transition to these applications.
* Tokens:
** {ControllerNameStart}: {ControllerNameStart} personal access tokens (PATs) are deprecated. You will move to platform gateway PATs.
** {PlatformNameShort}: Platform tokens provide an updated interface and are the standard for future use. You will transition to these tokens.
* Authenticator configurations:
** {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 to {PlatformNameShort} 2.6: The migration of all authenticator configurations from the {ControllerName} to the {Gateway} is automated. This includes third-party authentication configurations and sensitive data like SAML private keys or OAuth secret keys. If you use custom LDAP certificates, you must manually migrate them.
** {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 to {PlatformNameShort} 2.6: Authenticator configurations are not automatically migrated. 
LDAP settings configured in {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 remain as they were after upgrading to 2.6.

What RBAC ({Gateway} and/or {ControllerName}) control permissions will be missing in version 2.6?::

* *For 2.4 to 2.6 upgrades:* During the upgrade, authenticators and their mappings from the controller are imported into the gateway; therefore, you don't need to manually migrate authenticators.
* *For 2.5 to 2.6 upgrades:* Authenticators and their mappings in the {Gateway} continue to function as is, because no changes are imported.

Which version of PostgreSQL does {PlatformNameShort} 2.6 support?:: 
{PlatformNameShort} 2.6 supports {PostgresVers} for its managed databases and additionally supports {PostgresVers}, 16, and 17 for external databases.
