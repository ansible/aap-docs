= Migrating {PlatformName} to {OperatorPlatformName}

:context: aap-migration

[role="_abstract"]

Migrating your {PlatformName} deployment to the {OperatorPlatformNameShort} allows you to take advantage of the benefits provided by a Kubernetes native operator, including simplified upgrades and full lifecycle support for your {PlatformName} deployments.

[NOTE]
====
Upgrades of {EDAName} version 2.4 to 2.5 are not supported. Database migrations between {EDAName} 2.4 and {EDAName} 2.5 are not compatible.
====

Use these procedures to migrate any of the following deployments to the {OperatorPlatformNameShort}:

* OpenShift cluster A to OpenShift cluster B
* OpenShift namespace A to OpenShift namespace B
* Virtual machine (VM) based or containerized VM {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 → {PlatformNameShort} 2.5
