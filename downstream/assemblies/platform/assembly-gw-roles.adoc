= View, create, and assign roles to grant user access to resources

[role="_abstract"]

A role is a group of permissions for specific {PlatformName} resources.
These permissions govern actions such as viewing, changing, using, executing, or deleting resources such as projects, inventories, credentials, and job templates.
When you assign a role to a team or user you are granting them access to manage defined resources within the platform. 

Roles define permissions for a specific resource, centralizing all access to that resource through the role itself. 
This design makes roles reusable units that enable administrators to share defined behaviors among many resources or with different users.

As an administrator, you have the option of using default predefined roles, or you can create roles based on your organization's needs.
