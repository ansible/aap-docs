= Roles

Roles are units of organization in the {PlatformName}. When you assign a role to a team or user, you are granting access to use, read, or write credentials. Because of the file structure associated with a role, roles become redistributable units that enable you to share behavior among resources, or with other users. All access that is granted to use, read, or write credentials is handled through roles, and roles are defined for a resource.
