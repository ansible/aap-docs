= Roles

A role is a group of permissions for specific {PlatformName} resources.
These permissions govern actions like viewing, changing, using, executing, or deleting resources such as projects, inventories, credentials, and job templates.
When you assign a role to a team or user you are granting them access to manage defined resources within the platform. 

Roles are defined for a resource, and all access to a resource is handled through roles. 
When used in this way, roles become redistributable units that enable you to share behavior among resources or with other users.

As an administrator, you have the option of using default, or predefined, roles, or you can create roles based on your organization's needs.
