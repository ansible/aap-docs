= Managing devices

The {RedHatEdge} manages the device lifecycle from enrollment to decommissioning of a device. 
The device lifecycle also includes device management, such as organizing, monitoring, and updating your devices with the {RedHatEdge}.

You can manage your devices individually or in a fleet. 
With the {RedHatEdge} you can manage a whole fleet of devices as a single object instead of managing many devices individually.

You only need to specify the desired configuration once and then, the {RedHatEdge} applies the configuration to all devices in the fleet.

Understanding individual device management is the foundation for managing devices in a fleet. You might want to manage your devices individually in the following scenarios:

* If a few devices have different configuration.
* If you use external automation for updating the device.
