= Manage devices

[role="_abstract"]

The {RedHatEdge} manages the device lifecycle from enrollment to decommissioning of a device. 
The device lifecycle also includes device management, such as organizing, monitoring, and updating your devices with the {RedHatEdge}.

You can manage your devices individually or in a fleet. 
With the {RedHatEdge} you can manage a whole fleet of devices as a single object instead of managing many devices individually.

You only need to specify the required configuration once, and then the {RedHatEdge} applies the configuration to all devices in the fleet.

Understanding individual device management is the foundation for managing devices in a fleet. 
You might want to manage your devices individually in the following scenarios:

* If a few devices have different configurations.
* If you use external automation for updating the device.

The following sections focus on managing individual devices:

* xref:edge-manager-enroll[Enroll devices]
* xref:edge-manager-view-devices[View devices]
* xref:edge-manager-labels[Labels and label selectors]
* xref:edge-manager-update-labels[Updating labels on the CLI]
* xref:edge-manager-update-os[Update the operating system]
* xref:edge-manager-manage-os-config[Operating system configuration for edge devices]
