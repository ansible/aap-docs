The {MenuTopAE} _User Interface_ (UI) provides a graphical framework for your IT orchestration requirements. 

Use it to access your user profile, the *About* page, view related documentation, or log out using the icons in the page header. 

The navigation panel provides quick access to {ControllerName} resources, such as *Jobs*, *Templates*, *Schedules*, *Projects*, *Infrastructure*, and *Administration*.
