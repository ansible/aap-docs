= Backup and restore {PlatformNameShort}

[role="_abstract"]
You can protect your {PlatformNameShort} environment by backing up the database, configuration files, and keys. Use the `./setup.sh` script or playbooks to create compressed artifacts. This ensures a recovery path for single nodes or clusters, including restores, to secondary instances. 


[NOTE]
====
Use the installation program matching your current {PlatformNameShort} version for backups, and always use the latest available version for restores. Ensure your PostgreSQL version is supported by checking the link:{URLPlanningGuide}/platform-system-requirements[System requirements] in _{TitlePlanningGuide}_.
