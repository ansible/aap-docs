= Data movement during upgrade

During the upgrade process, all {ControllerName} _Identity Access Management_ (IAM) data,  that is, users, teams, organizations, their memberships, and common roles are moved from {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 to the {Gateway}. 
This movement makes {ControllerName} the default source of IAM data for the {Gateway}, ensuring that users retain their memberships and are assigned appropriate platform-level roles.
