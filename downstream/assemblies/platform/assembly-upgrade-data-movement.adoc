= Identity access management changes when upgrading to {PlatformVers}

[role="_abstract"]
During the upgrade process to {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers}, Identity Access Management (IAM) data, including users, teams, organizations, their memberships, and associated roles, is migrated from {ControllerName} and {HubName} to {Gateway}. 

This migration establishes {ControllerName} as the primary source of IAM data for {Gateway}, ensuring continuity of user memberships and appropriate platform-level role assignments.

[NOTE]
====
We recommend upgrading directly from the latest version of 2.4 to {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers}, without using 2.5 as an intermediate step, as the upgrade process to {PlatformVers} is less complex.
