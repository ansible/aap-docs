= Tune {ControllerName} to improve performance 

[role="_abstract"]
Tune your {ControllerName} to optimize performance and scalability. When planning your workload, ensure that you identify your performance and scaling needs, adjust for any limitations, and monitor your deployment. 

{ControllerNameStart} is a distributed system with many components that you can tune, including the following:

* Task system in charge of scheduling jobs
* Control Plane in charge of controlling jobs and processing output
* Execution plane where jobs run
* Web server in charge of serving the API
* WebSocket system that serve and broadcast WebSocket connections and data
* Database used by many components
