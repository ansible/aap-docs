= Operating system images for using with the {RedHatEdge}

[role="_abstract"]

Image-based operating systems allow the operating system and its configuration and applications to be versioned, deployed, and updated as a single unit.
Using an image-based operating system reduces operational risks by doing the following:

* Minimizing potential drift between what is tested and what is deployed to a large number of devices.
* Minimizing the risk of failed updates that require expensive maintenance or replacement through transactional updates and rollbacks.

The {RedHatEdge} focuses on image-based Linux operating systems that run bootable container images (`bootc`).

For more information, see link:https://bootc-dev.github.io/bootc/[bootc].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `bootc` tool does not update package-based operating systems.
