= {RedHatEdge} overview

The {RedHatEdge} provides streamlined management of edge devices and applications through a declarative approach. 
By defining the required state of your edge devices, which includes your operating system versions, host configurations, and application deployments, the {RedHatEdge} automatically implements and maintains these configurations across your entire device fleet.

The {RedHatEdge} on {PlatformNameShort} offers elevated integration with your automations.
You can then focus more on orchestrating the environment without worrying about updating the operating system.
