= {ControllerNameStart} configuration

You can configure some {ControllerName} options using the *Settings* menu of the User Interface.

*Save* applies the changes you make, but it does not exit the edit dialog.

To return to the *Settings* page, from the navigation panel select {MenuAEAdminSettings} or use the breadcrumbs at the top of the current view.
