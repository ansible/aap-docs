= {PlatformName} Architecture

Deploy all components of {PlatformNameShort} so that all features and capabilities are available for use without the need to take further action.

Red Hat tests the installation of {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers} based on a defined set of infrastructure topologies or reference architectures. Enterprise organizations can use one of the {EnterpriseTopologyPlural} for production deployments to ensure the highest level of uptime, performance, and continued scalability. Organizations or deployments that are resource constrained can use a {GrowthTopology}.

The following section provides a comprehensive architectural example of an {PlatformNameShort} deployment.
