= Execution environments

Unlike legacy virtual environments, {ExecEnvShort}s are container images that make it possible to incorporate system-level dependencies and collection-based content. 
Each {ExecEnvShort} enables you to have a customized image to run jobs and has only what is necessary when running the job.

The default view for the *Execution Environments* page is collapsed (*Compact*) with the {ExecEnvShort} name and its image name. Selecting the {ExecEnvShort} name expands the entry for more information.

For each {ExecEnvShort} listed, you can use the image:leftpencil.png[Edit,15,15] to edit the properties for the selected {ExecEnvShort} or the {MoreActionsIcon} to duplicate the {ExecEnvShort}. These are also avilable from the *Details* page.
