= Execution environments

Unlike legacy virtual environments, {ExecEnvShort}s are container images that make it possible to incorporate system-level dependencies and collection-based content. 
Each {ExecEnvShort} enables you to have a customized image to run jobs, and each of them contain only what is necessary when running the job, nothing more.
