= Metrics

A metrics endpoint, `/api/v2/metrics/` is available in the API that produces instantaneous metrics about {ControllerName}, which can be
consumed by system monitoring software such as the open source project Prometheus.

The types of data shown at the `metrics/` endpoint are `Content-type: text/plain` and `application/json`. 

This endpoint contains useful information, such as counts of how many active user sessions there are, or how many jobs are actively running on each {ControllerName} node. 

You can configure Prometheus to scrape these metrics from {ControllerName} by hitting the {ControllerName} metrics endpoint and storing this data in a time-series database. 

Clients can later use Prometheus in conjunction with other software such as Grafana or Metricsbeat to visualize that data and set up alerts.
