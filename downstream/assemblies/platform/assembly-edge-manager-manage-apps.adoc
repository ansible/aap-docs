= Managing applications on an edge device

You can deploy, update, or remove applications on a device by updating the list of applications in the device specification. 
When the {RedHatEdge} agent checks in and detects the change in the specification, the agent downloads any new or updated application packages and images from an Open Container Initiative (OCI)-compatible registry. 
Then, the agent deploys the packages to the appropriate application runtime or removes them from that runtime.

The {RedHatEdge} supports the `podman-compose` tool as the application runtime and format.

.Prerequisites

* You must install the {RedHatEdge} CLI.
* You must log in to the {RedHatEdge} service.
* Your device must run an operating system image with the `podman-compose` tool installed.
