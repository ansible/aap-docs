= Managing applications

You can deploy, update, or remove applications on a device by updating the list of applications in the device's specification. 
The next time the agent checks in, it learns of the change in the specification, downloads any new or updated application packages and images from an OCI-compatible registry. 
Then it deploys them to the appropriate application runtime or removes them from that runtime.

The following table shows the application runtimes and formats supported by {RedHatEdge}:
