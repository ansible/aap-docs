= Manage applications on an edge device

[role="_abstract"]

You can deploy, update, or remove applications on a device by updating the list of applications in the device specification. 
When the {RedHatEdge} agent checks in and detects the change in the specification, the agent downloads any new or updated application packages and images from an Open Container Initiative (OCI)-compatible registry. 
Then, the agent deploys the packages to the appropriate application runtime or removes them from that runtime.

The {RedHatEdge} supports the `podman-compose` tool as the application runtime and format.

For more information, see xref:edge-manager-build-bootc[Building a _bootc_ operating system image for use with the {RedHatEdge}].
