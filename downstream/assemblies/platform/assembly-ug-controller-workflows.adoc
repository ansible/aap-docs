= Workflows in {ControllerName}

Workflows enable you to configure a sequence of disparate job templates (or workflow templates) that may or may not share inventory, playbooks, or permissions. 

Workflows have `admin` and `execute` permissions, similar to job templates. 
A workflow accomplishes the task of tracking the full set of jobs that were part of the release process as a single unit.

Job or workflow templates are linked together using a graph-like structure called nodes. 
These nodes can be jobs, project syncs, or inventory syncs. 
A template can be part of different workflows or used multiple times in the same workflow. 
A copy of the graph structure is saved to a workflow job when you launch the workflow.

The following example shows a workflow that contains all three, as well as a workflow job template:

As the workflow runs, jobs are spawned from the node's linked template. 
Nodes linking to a job template which has prompt-driven fields (job_type, job_tags, skip_tags, limit) can contain those fields, and is not prompted on launch.
Job templates that prompt for a credential or inventory, without defaults, are not available for inclusion in a workflow.
