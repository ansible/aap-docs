= {PlatformNameShort} containerized installation

:context: aap-containerized-installation

[role="_abstract"]
{PlatformNameShort} is a commercial offering that helps teams manage complex multi-tier deployments by adding control, knowledge, and delegation to Ansible-powered environments.

This guide helps you to understand the installation requirements and processes behind the containerized version of {PlatformNameShort}. 

[NOTE]

.Prerequisites

* A {RHEL} (RHEL) 9.2 based host. Minimal operating system (OS) base install is recommended.
* A non-root user for the {RHEL} host, with sudo or other Ansible supported privilege escalation (sudo recommended). This user is responsible for the installation of containerized {PlatformNameShort}.
* SSH public key authentication for the non-root user. For guidelines on setting up SSH public key authentication for the non-root user, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4110681[How to configure SSH public key authentication for passwordless login].
** SSH keys are only required when installing on remote hosts. If doing a self contained local VM based installation, you can use *ansible_connection: local*.
* Internet access from the {RHEL} host if you are using the default online installation method.
* The appropriate network ports are open if a firewall is in place. For more information about the ports to open, see link:{URLTopologies}/container-topologies[Container topologies] in _{TitleTopologies}_.

== Tested deployment topologies

Red Hat tests {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers} with a defined set of topologies to give you opinionated deployment options. The supported topologies include infrastructure topology diagrams, tested system configurations, example inventory files, and network ports information.

For containerized {PlatformNameShort}, there are two infrastructure topology shapes:

. Growth - (All-in-one) Intended for organizations that are getting started with {PlatformNameShort}. This topology allows for smaller footprint deployments.

. Enterprise - Intended for organizations that require {PlatformNameShort} deployments to have redundancy or higher compute for large volumes of automation. This is a more future-proofed scaled out architecture.

For more information about the tested deployment topologies for containerized {PlatformNameShort}, see link:{URLTopologies}/container-topologies[Container topologies] in _{TitleTopologies}_.

== System requirements
Each virtual machine (VM) has the following system requirements:
