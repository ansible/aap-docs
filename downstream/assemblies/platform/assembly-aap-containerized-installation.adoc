= {PlatformNameShort} containerized installation

:context: aap-containerized-installation

[role="_abstract"]
{PlatformNameShort} is a commercial offering that helps teams manage complex multi-tier deployments by adding control, knowledge, and delegation to Ansible-powered environments.

This guide helps you to understand the installation requirements and processes behind the containerized version of {PlatformNameShort}.

.Prerequisites

* A {RHEL} (RHEL) 9.2 based host. Minimal operating system (OS) base install is recommended.
* A non-root user for the {RHEL} host, with sudo or other Ansible supported privilege escalation (sudo recommended). This user is responsible for the installation of containerized {PlatformNameShort}.
* It is recommended that you set up SSH public key authentication for the non-root user. For guidelines on setting up SSH public key authentication for the non-root user, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4110681[How to configure SSH public key authentication for passwordless login].
** SSH keys are only required when installing on remote hosts. If doing a self contained local VM based installation, you can use *ansible_connection: local*.
* Internet access from the {RHEL} host if you are using the default online installation method.
* The appropriate network ports are open if a firewall is in place. For more information about the ports to open, see link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/supported_deployment_models/index#container-topologies[Container supported topologies] in _{TitleTopologies}_.
