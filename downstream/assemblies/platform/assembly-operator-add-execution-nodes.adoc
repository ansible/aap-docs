= Enabling execution nodes on {OperatorPlatformName}

:context: operator-upgrade

[role="_abstract"]

You can enable the {OperatorPlatformNameShort} with execution nodes by downloading and installing the install bundle.  

[NOTE]
====
When using a custom certificate for Receptor nodes, the certificate requires the `otherName` field specified in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) of the certificate with the value `1.3.6.1.4.1.2312.19.1`.
For more information, see link:https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/receptor/en/latest/user_guide/tls.html#above-the-mesh-tls[Above the mesh TLS].

Receptor does not support the usage of wildcard certificates.
Additionally, each Receptor certificate must have the host FQDN specified in its SAN for TLS hostname validation to be correctly performed.
