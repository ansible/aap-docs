= About Ansible automation platform metrics-utility

The Ansible Automation Platform metrics utility tool (metrics-utility) is a command-line utility that is installed on a system containing an instance of automation controller. 

When installed and configured, metrics-utility gathers billing-related metrics from your system and creates a consumption-based billing report. Metrics-utility is especially suited for users who have multiple managed hosts and want to use consumption-based billing. Once a report is generated, it is deposited in a target location that you specify in the configuration file. 

Metrics-utility collects two types of data from your system: configuration data and reporting data. 

The configuration data includes the following information:

* version information for automation controller and for the operating system 
* subscription information
* the base URL

The reporting data includes the following information:

* job name and ID
* host name
* inventory name 
* organization name 
* project name 
* success or failure information
* the date and time the report was generated.  

To ensure that metrics-utility continues to work as configured, be sure to clear your report directories of outdated reports regularly.
