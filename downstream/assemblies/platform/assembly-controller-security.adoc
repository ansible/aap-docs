= Security

The following sections describe how {ControllerName} handles and enables you to control file system security.

All playbooks are executed through the `awx` file system user. 
For running jobs, {ControllerName} offers job isolation through the use of Linux containers. 
This protection ensures that jobs can only access playbooks, roles, and data from the Project directory for that job template.

For credential security, you can choose to upload locked SSH keys and set the unlock password to "ask". 
You can also choose to have the system prompt for SSH credentials or sudo passwords rather than having the system store them in the database.
