= Installing the {OperatorPlatformName} on {OCP}

[role="_abstract"]

[NOTE]
====
For information about the {OperatorPlatformNameShort} system requirements and infrastructure topology see 
link:{URLTopologies}/ocp-topologies[Operator topologies] in _{TitleTopologies}_.
====

When installing your {OperatorPlatformNameShort} you have a choice of a namespace-scoped operator or a cluster-scoped operator.
This depends on the update channel you choose, stable-2.x or cluster-scoped-2.x.

A namespace-scoped operator is confined to one namespace, offering tighter security. A cluster-scoped operator spans multiple namespaces, which grants broader permissions.

If you are managing multiple {PlatformNameShort} instances with the same {OperatorPlatformNameShort} version, use the cluster-scoped operator, which uses a single operator to manage all {PlatformNameShort} custom resources in your cluster. 

If you need multiple operator versions in the same cluster, you must use the namespace-scoped operator.
The operator and the deployment share the same namespace.
This can also be helpful when debugging because the operator logs pertain to custom resources in that namespace only.

For help with installing a namespace or cluster-scoped operator see the following procedure.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot deploy {PlatformNameShort} in the default namespace on your OpenShift Cluster. The `aap` namespace is recommended. You can use a custom namespace, but it should run only {PlatformNameShort}.
====


.Prerequisites
* You have installed the {PlatformName} catalog in OperatorHub.
* You have created a `StorageClass` object for your platform and a persistent volume claim (PVC) with `ReadWriteMany` access mode. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{OCPLatest}/storage/dynamic-provisioning.html[Dynamic provisioning] for details.
* To run {OCP} clusters on Amazon Web Services (AWS) with `ReadWriteMany` access mode, you must add NFS or other storage.
** For information about the AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) or to use the `aws-ebs` storage class, see link:{BaseURL}/openshift_container_platform/4.10/html-single/storage/index#persistent-storage-aws[Persistent storage using AWS Elastic Block Store].
** To use multi-attach `ReadWriteMany` access mode for AWS EBS, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volumes-multi.html[Attaching a volume to multiple instances with Amazon EBS Multi-Attach].
