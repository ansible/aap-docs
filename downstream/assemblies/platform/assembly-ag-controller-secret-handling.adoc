== Connection security

{ControllerNameStart} allows for connections to internal services, external access, and managed nodes.

[NOTE]
====
To configure PostgreSQL or run {ControllerName} you must have a 'local' user. Using an LDAP user fails because the local user account is used to configure access for the LDAP user, but only after you are able to log in to {ControllerName}
