[id="controller-api-pagination"]

= View collection responses that are not shown by default

[role="_abstract"]
The API paginates responses for collections. 
This means that while a collection might contain tens or hundreds of thousands of objects, in each web request, only a limited number of results are returned for API performance reasons.
