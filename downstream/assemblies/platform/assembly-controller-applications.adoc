Create and configure token-based authentication for external applications such as ServiceNow and Jenkins.
With token-based authentication, external applications can easily integrate with {PlatformNameShort}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{ControllerNameStart} OAuth applications on the platform UI are not supported for 2.4 to 2.5 migration. See link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7091987[this Knowledgebase article] for more information. 
====

With OAuth 2 you can use tokens to share data with an application without disclosing login information. 
You can configure these tokens as read-only.

You can create an application that is representative of the external application you are integrating with, then use it to create tokens for the application to use on behalf of its users.

Associating these tokens with an application resource enables you to manage all tokens issued for a particular application. 
By separating the issue of tokens under *OAuth Applications*, you can revoke all tokens based on the application without having to revoke all tokens in the system.
