= About the installer inventory file

[role="_abstract"]
Configure your {PlatformNameShort} installation by defining hosts, groups, and deployment scenarios in the inventory file. Learn how to organize your infrastructure, set installation variables, and verify host configurations for successful deployments.

By using an inventory file, Ansible can manage a large number of hosts with a single command.
Inventories also help you use Ansible more efficiently by reducing the number of command line options you have to specify.

The inventory file can be in one of many formats, depending on the inventory plugins that you have.
The most common formats are `INI` and `YAML`.
Inventory files listed in this document are shown in INI format.

The location of the inventory file depends on the installer you used.
The following table shows possible locations:

[NOTE]
====
The {PlatformNameShort} RPM installer was deprecated in 2.5 and will be removed in {PlatformNameShort} 2.7. The RPM installer will be supported for RHEL 9 during the lifecycle of {PlatformNameShort} 2.6 to support migrations to existing supported topologies. For more information on upgrade and migration paths, see the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html-single/planning_your_upgrade/index#upgrade-support-matrix[Support matrix for upgrade scenarios].

You can verify the hosts in your inventory using the command:

The first part of the inventory file specifies the hosts or groups that Ansible can work with.
