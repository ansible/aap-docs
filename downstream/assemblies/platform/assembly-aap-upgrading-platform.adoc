= Upgrading to {PlatformName} {PlatformVers}

:context: aap-upgrading-platform

[role="_abstract"]

To upgrade your {PlatformName}, start by reviewing link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.6/html/planning_your_upgrade[Planning your upgrade] to ensure a successful upgrade. You can then download the desired version of the {PlatformNameShort} installer, configure the inventory file in the installation bundle to reflect your environment, and then run the installer.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers}, while the automation controller's API remains for backward compatibility, new installations must use the {Gateway} API for managing organizations, teams, and users. Using the legacy API will introduce a delay of up to 15 minutes before changes are synchronized to all components, including {EDAcontroller}.
