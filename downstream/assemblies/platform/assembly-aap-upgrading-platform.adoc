Ensure you review the link:{URLPlanningGuide}/ref-network-ports-protocols_planning[2.5 Network ports and protocols] for architectural changes and {LinkTopologies} for information on opinionated deployment models. 

* You have reviewed the link:{URLPlanningGuide}/ha-redis_planning#gw-centralized-redis_planning[centralized Redis] instance offered by {PlatformNameShort} for both standalone and clustered topologies.

* Prior to upgrading your {PlatformName}, ensure you have reviewed {LinkPlanningGuide} for a successful upgrade. You can then download the desired version of the {PlatformNameShort} installer, configure the inventory file in the installation bundle to reflect your environment, and then run the installer.

* Before upgrading your {PlatformName}, ensure you have upgraded to {ControllerName} 4.5 or later. 

* When upgrading to {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers}, you must use RPM installer version 2.5-11 or later. If you use an older installer, the installation might fail.
