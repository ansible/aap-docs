= Deploying a high availability automation hub

A high availability (HA) configuration increases reliability and scalablility for {HubName} deployments.

HA deployments of {HubName} have multiple nodes that concurrently run the same service with a load balancer distributing workload (an "active-active" configuration).
This configuration eliminates single points of failure to minimize service downtime and allows you to easily add or remove nodes to meet workload demands.

This guide covers deployment of a HA {HubName} application stack only.
Other HA components, such as database and file system HA, or setting up DNS load balancing, are out of scope for this guide.
