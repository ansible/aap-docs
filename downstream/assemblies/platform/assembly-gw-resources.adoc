= Manage user access to resources

[role="_abstract"]

You can manage user access to {PlatformNameShort} resources and what users can do with those resources. Users are granted access through the roles they are directly assigned by an administrator, or through roles inherited from a team assignment. 
{PlatformNameShort} resources differ depending on the functionality you are configuring. For example, resources can be job templates and projects for automation execution or decision environments and rulebook activations for automation decisions.
