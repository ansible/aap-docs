= Hosts

[role="_abstract"]
A host is a system managed by {PlatformNameShort}, which may include a physical, virtual, cloud-based server, or other device. 

Typically a host is an operating system instance. 

Hosts are grouped in inventories and are sometimes referred to as a “nodes”.

Ansible works against multiple managed nodes or “hosts” in your infrastructure at the same time, using a list or group of lists known as an inventory. 

Once your inventory is defined, use patterns to select the hosts or groups you want Ansible to run against.
