= Renew and change SSL/TLS certificates

:context: renewing-changing-ssl-certs-keys

[role="_abstract"]
If your current SSL/TLS certificates have expired or will expire soon, you can either renew or replace the SSL/TLS certificates used by {PlatformNameShort}.

You must renew the SSL/TLS certificates if you need to regenerate them with new information such as new hosts.

You must replace the SSL/TLS certificates if you want to use certificates signed by an internal certificate authority.
