= Renewing and changing the SSL/TLS certificates

:context: renewing-changing-ssl-certs-keys

[role="_abstract"]
If your current SSL/TLS certificates have expired or will expire soon, you can either renew or replace the SSL/TLS certificates used by {PlatformNameShort}.

You must renew the SSL/TLS certificates if you need to regenerate them with new information such as new hosts.

You must replace the SSL/TLS certificates if you want to use certificates signed by an internal certificate authority.

== Container-based installations

You can change the TLS certificates and keys for your container-based {PlatformNameShort} installation. This process involves a preparation step, either providing new custom certificates or deleting or moving the old certificates, followed by running the installation program.

== Operator-based installations

== RPM-based installations

To renew or change SSL certificates for RPM-based installations, you can edit the inventory file and run the installation program.
The installation program verifies that all {PlatformNameShort} components are working. 

Alternatively, you can change the SSL certificates manually. 
This is quicker, but there is no automatic verification.

Red Hat recommends that you use the installation program to make changes to your {PlatformNameShort} deployment.
