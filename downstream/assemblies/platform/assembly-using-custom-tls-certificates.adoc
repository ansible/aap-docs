= Using custom TLS certificates

{PlatformName} uses X.509 certificate and key pairs to secure traffic both internally between {PlatformNameShort} components and externally for public UI and API connections. 

There are two primary ways to manage TLS certificates for your {PlatformNameShort} deployment: 

. {PlatformNameShort} generated certificates (this is the default)
. User-provided certificates

// AAP generated certificates
include::platform/con-installer-generated-certs.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== User-provided certificates

To use your own TLS certificates and keys to replace some or all of the self-signed certificates generated during installation, you can set specific variables in your inventory file. These certificates and keys must be generated by a public or organizational CA in advance so that they are available during the installation process.

// Option 1: Use a custom CA to generate all TLS certificates 
include::platform/proc-use-custom-ca-certs.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

// Option 2: Provide custom TLS certificates for each service
include::platform/proc-provide-custom-tls-certs-per-service.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

// Considerations for Option 2
