= Authentication movement

During an upgrade from {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 to {PlatformVers}, only complete authentication provider configurations are migrated to the new {Gateway}.

A configuration is considered complete when it meets the following criteria:

* *LDAP*: You must specify a server URL.  
* *GitHub and Microsoft Azure AD*: You must specify both a key and a secret.  
* *OIDC*: You must define a key, a secret, and an OIDC endpoint.  
* *RADIUS* and *TACACS+*: You must specify the host.

Before proceeding with the upgrade, ensure that you complete the following steps:

* *Create a local administrator account* and verify that you can log in to the environment using local authentication. 
You can also use the default administrator account from the inventory file.
* *Enable the local authenticator* in the target environment to ensure a fallback login method is available.
* *Perform a full backup* of your existing environment.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This is a critical step for data recovery in case any issues occur during the migration process.
====

*Post upgrade*

* *Update the callback URLs* in your _Identity Provider_ (IdP) configurations after the movement. 
This is necessary for OAuth and SSO providers to function correctly with the new {Gateway} architecture. 
For more information, see link:{URLCentralAuth}/gw-configure-authentication#gw-update-callback-urls[Updating callback URLs for OAuth and SSO providers].
* *Reestablish custom certificates for LDAPS* if your LDAP authentication uses custom certificates in the system's truststore. 
This configuration is not automatically migrated and you must manually reestablish it.

The movement of existing authentication configurations from a {PlatformName} 2.4 {ControllerName} to the new {PlatformVers} {Gateway} is automated. 
The following tables show how settings and mappings from the old {ControllerName} schema are transformed to fit the new {Gateway} API schema.
