= Setting up a customer provided (external) database

[role="_abstract"]
There are two possible scenarios for setting up an external database:

. An external database with PostgreSQL admin credentials
. An external database without PostgreSQL admin credentials

[IMPORTANT]
====
* When using an external database with {PlatformNameShort}, you must create and maintain that database. Ensure that you clear your external database when uninstalling {PlatformNameShort}.

* {PlatformName} requires customer provided (external) database to have ICU support.

* During configuration of an external database, you must check the external database coverage. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4010491[{PlatformName} Database Scope of Coverage].
