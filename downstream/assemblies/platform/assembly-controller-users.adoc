:context: access-mgmt-users

Users associated with an organization are shown in the *Users* tab of the organization.

You can add other users to an organization, including a normal user or system administrator, but first, you must create them.

[NOTE] 
====
{PlatformNameShort} automatically creates a default admin user so they can log in and set up {PlatformNameShort} for their organization. This user can not be deleted or modified. 

====
You can sort or search the User list by *Username*, *First name*, *Last name*, or *Email*. Click the arrows in the header to toggle your sorting preference.
You can view *User type* and *Email* beside the user name on the Users page.
