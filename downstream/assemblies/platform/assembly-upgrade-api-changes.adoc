= API changes in {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers}

[role="_abstract"]
{PlatformNameShort} 2.5 and {PlatformVers} include changes to API endpoints with the addition of {Gateway}. Versions 2.5 and {PlatformVers} expose API access to individual services ({ControllerName}, {PrivateHubName}, {EDAName}) to maintain compatibility with existing REST API integrations. This access will be removed in a future release.

These changes impact your organization if you have 2.4 API calls implemented directly with {ControllerName} or {PrivateHubName}, or if you are integrating directly with {ControllerName} or {PrivateHubName} hosts. You can use API endpoints exposed through the {Gateway} for all {PlatformNameShort} services starting with {PlatformNameShort} 2.5. Moving integrations to API endpoints exposed through the {Gateway} that your integrations are not disrupted when direct service API access is removed in a future {PlatformNameShort} release.
