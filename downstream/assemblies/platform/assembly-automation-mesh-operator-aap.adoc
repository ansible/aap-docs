= {AutomationMeshStart} for operator-based {PlatformName}

[role="_abstract"]
Scaling your automation mesh is available on OpenShift deployments of {PlatformName} and is possible through adding or removing nodes from your cluster dynamically, using the *Instances* resource of the {PlatformNameShort} UI, without running the installation script.

Instances serve as nodes in your mesh topology. 
{AutomationMeshStart} enables you to extend the footprint of your automation. 
The location where you launch a job can be different from the location where the ansible-playbook runs.

To manage instances from the {PlatformNameShort} UI, you must have System Administrator or System Auditor permissions.

In general, the more processor cores (CPU) and memory (RAM) a node has, the more jobs that can be scheduled to run on that node at once.
