= View key usage metrics with {AutomationDashboardName}

The {AutomationDashboardName} utility is a web-based container application that provides key metrics related to job execution, efficiency, and the value derived from automation. {AutomationDashboardName} uses automation metrics to provide automation usage data from {PlatformNameShort}. You can use this data to determine the cost of performing tasks manually versus the cost of performing tasks through automation. This comparison is used to demonstrate the savings achievable through automation.

{AutomationDashboardName} is designed to help you:

* Get a clear overview of the automation occurring in your environment.

* Track metrics, like time saved and errors reduced, to quantify the benefits of automation.

* Analyze job execution times and failure rates to pinpoint areas where automation can be improved.

* Use the data generated by {AutomationDashboardName} to make informed decisions about automation strategy, resource allocation, and prioritization of automation projects.

By effectively utilizing {AutomationDashboardName}, you can gain valuable insights into your {PlatformNameShort} usage and drive continuous improvement in your automation practices.
