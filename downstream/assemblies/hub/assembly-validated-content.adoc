= Configuring {Valid} with the installer

[role="_abstract"]
{PlatformName} includes {Valid}, which complements existing {CertifiedCon}. {Valid} provides an expert-led path for performing operational tasks on a variety of platforms from both Red Hat and our trusted partners.

You can obtain {Valid} during the installation process.
When you download and run the RPM bundle installer, certified and validated collections are automatically uploaded.
Certified collections are uploaded into the `rh-certified` repository.
Validated collections are uploaded into the `validated` repository.

You can change the default configuration by using two variables:

* `automationhub_seed_collections` is a boolean that defines whether or not preloading is enabled.
* `automationhub_collection_seed_repository` is a variable that enables you to specify the type of content to upload when it is set to `true`.
Possible values are `certified` or `validated`.
If this variable is missing, both content sets will be uploaded.

[NOTE]
====
Changing the default configuration may require further platform configuration changes for other content. 
====

// == Installing validated content using the tarball

// If you are not using the bundle installer, you can use a standalone .tar file, `ansible-validated-content-bundle-1.tar.gz`.
// You can also use this standalone .tar file later to update validated contents in any environment, when a newer .tar file becomes available, without having to re-run the bundle installer.

// .Prerequisites
// Use the following required variables to run the playbook.

// [cols="50%,50%",options="header"]
// |====
// | Name | Description
// | *`automationhub_admin_password`* | Your administration password.
// | *`automationhub_api_token`* | The API token generated for your {HubName}.
// | *`automationhub_main_url`* | For example, `\https://automationhub.example.com`
// | *`automationhub_require_content_approval`* | Boolean (`true` or `false`)
//
// This must match the value used during {HubName} deployment.
//
// This variable is set to `true` by the installer.
// |====

// .Procedure
// . To obtain the .tar file, navigate to the link:{PlatformDownloadUrl}[{PlatformName} download] page and select // *Ansible Validated Content*.
// . Upload the content and define the variables (this example uses `automationhub_api_token`):
// +
// [options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
// ----
// ansible-playbook collection_seed.yml
// -e automationhub_api_token=<api_token>
// -e automationhub_main_url=https://automationhub.example.com
// -e automationhub_require_content_approval=true
// ----
// +
// [NOTE]
// ====
// Use either `automationhub_admin_password` or `automationhub_api_token`, not both.
// ====

// When complete, the collections are visible in the validated collection section of {PrivateHubName}.
// Users can now view and download collections from your {PrivateHubName}.
