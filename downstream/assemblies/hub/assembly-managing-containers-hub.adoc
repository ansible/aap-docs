[role="_abstract"]
{PrivateHubNameStart} functions as an internal container registry for your organization. It allows you to store, manage, and govern the container images, or {ExecEnvName}, that your teams use to run automation.

To effectively manage these containers, it is important to distinguish between the two types of registries in your workflow:

External registries (Source): Public or third-party registries where you source your initial images. Common examples include the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog (registry.redhat.io) or Quay.io. You pull images from these registries to your local environment.

{PrivateHubNameStart} registry (Destination): Your internal, secure registry hosted on {PrivateHubName}. You push your curated and approved images here. Your {PlatformNameShort} infrastructure then pulls these images from {PrivateHubName} to execute jobs.
