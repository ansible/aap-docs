= Red Hat Certified, validated, and Ansible Galaxy content in automation hub

:context: managing-cert-validated-content

[role="_abstract"]
{CertifiedName} are included in your subscription to {PlatformName}. Using {HubNameMain}, you can access and curate a unique set of collections from all forms of Ansible content.

Red Hat Ansible content contains two types of content:

* {CertifiedName}
* {Valid} collections

You can use both {CertifiedName} or {Valid} collections to build your automation library. For more information on the differences between {CertifiedName} and {Valid} collections, see the Knowledgebase article link:https://access.redhat.com/support/articles/ansible-automation-platform-certified-content[{CertifiedName} and {Valid}], or xref:assembly-validated-content[{Valid}] in this guide.

// hherbly--removed, see aap-20548  
// Ansible validated collections are available in your {PrivateHubName} through the platform installer.
// When you download {PlatformName} with the bundled installer, validated content is pre-populated into the {PrivateHubName} by default, but only if you enable the {PrivateHubName} as part of the inventory.

// If you are not using the bundle installer, you can use a Red Hat supplied Ansible playbook to install validated content.

// For further information, see xref:assembly-validated-content[{Valid}].

You can update these collections manually by downloading their packages.

// == Why certify Ansible collections?

// The Ansible certification program represents a shared statement of support for {CertifiedCon} between Red Hat and the ecosystem partner.
// An end customer experiencing trouble with Ansible and certified partner content can, for example, open a support ticket describing a request for information, or a problem with Red Hat, and expect the ticket to be resolved by Red Hat and the ecosystem partner.

// Red Hat offers go-to-market benefits for Certified Partners to grow market awareness, generate demand, and sell collaboratively.

// Red Hat {CertifiedName} are distributed through {HubNameMain} (subscription required), a centralized repository for jointly supported Ansible Content.
// As a certified partner, publishing collections to {HubNameMain} gives end customers the power to manage how trusted automation content is used in their production environment with a well-known support life cycle.

// For more information about getting started with certifying a solution, see link:https://connect.redhat.com/en/partner-with-us/red-hat-ansible-automation-certification[Red Hat Partner Resources].

// == How do I get a collection certified?

// For instructions on certifying your collection, see the Ansible certification policy guide on link:http://www.ansible.com/partners[Red Hat Partner Connect].

// [discrete]
// == How does the joint support agreement on Certified Collections work?

// If a customer raises an issue with the Red Hat support team about a certified collection, Red Hat support assesses the issue and checks whether the problem is with Ansible or Ansible usage.
// They also check whether the issue is with a certified collection.
// If there is a problem with the certified collection, support teams transfer the issue to the vendor owner of the certified collection through an agreed-upon tool such as TSANet.

// [discrete]
// == Can I create and certify a collection containing only Ansible Roles?

// You can create and certify collections that contain only roles.
// Current testing requirements are focused on collections containing modules, and additional resources are currently in progress for testing collections containing only roles.
// Contact ansiblepartners@redhat.com for more information.

You can use {HubNameMain} to distribute the relevant {CertifiedColl}s to your users by creating a requirements file or a synclist. Use a requirements file to install collections to your {HubName}, as synclists can only be managed by users with platform administrator privileges. 

Before you can use a requirements file to install content, you must: 

. xref:proc-obtaining-org-collection-url[Obtain an automation hub API token]
. xref:proc-set-rhcertified-remote.adoc[Use the API token to configure a remote repository in your local hub]
. Then, xref:proc-create-requirements-file[Create a requirements file].
