= Frequently asked questions about {CertifiedCon}

The following is a list of Frequently Asked Questions for the {PlatformName} Certification Program. 
If you have any questions regarding the following items, email ansiblepartners@redhat.com.

== Why certify Ansible collections?

The Ansible certification program enables a shared statement of support for {CertifiedCon} between Red Hat and the ecosystem partner. 
An end customer, experiencing trouble with Ansible and certified partner content, can open a support ticket, for example, a request for information, or a problem with Red Hat, and expect the ticket to be resolved by Red Hat and the ecosystem partner. 

Red Hat offers go-to-market benefits for Certified Partners to grow market awareness, generate demand, and sell collaboratively.

Red Hat {CertifiedName} are distributed through {HubNameMain} (subscription required), a centralized repository for jointly supported Ansible Content. 
As a certified partner, publishing collections to {HubNameMain} provides end customers the power to manage how trusted automation content is used in their production environment with a well-known support life cycle.

For more information about getting started with certifying a solution, see link:https://connect.redhat.com/en/partner-with-us/red-hat-ansible-automation-certification[Red Hat Partner Connect].

== How do I get a collection certified?

For instructions on certifying your collection, see the Ansible certification policy guide on link:http://www.ansible.com/partners[Red Hat Partner Connect].

== Whatâ€™s the difference between {Galaxy} and {HubNameMain}?

Collections published to {Galaxy} are the latest content published by the Ansible community and have no joint support claims associated with them. 
{Galaxy} is the recommended frontend directory for the Ansible community accessing content.

Collections published to {HubNameMain} are targeted for joint customers of Red Hat and selected partners. 
Customers need an Ansible subscription to access and download collections on {HubNameMain}. 
A certified collection means that Red Hat and partners have a strategic relationship in place and are ready to support joint customers, and may have had additional testing and validation done against them.

== How do I request a namespace on {Galaxy}?

To request a namespace through an {Galaxy} GitHub issue, follow these steps:

* Send an email to ansiblepartners@redhat.com 
* Include the GitHub username used to sign up on {Galaxy}.

You must have logged in at least once for the system to validate.

After users are added as administrators of the namespace, you can use the self-serve process to add more administrators.

== Are there any restrictions for {Galaxy} namespace naming?

Collection namespaces must follow python module name convention. 
This means collections should have short, all lowercase names. 
You can use underscores in the collection name if it improves readability.

== Are there any recommendations for collection naming?

Create a collection with `company_name.product` format. 
This format means that multiple products can have different collections under the company namespace.

== How do I get a namespace on {HubNameMain}?

By default namespaces used on {Galaxy} are also used on {HubNameMain} by the Ansible partner team. 
For any queries and clarifications contact ansiblepartners@redhat.com.

== How do I run sanity tests on my collection?

Ansible sanity tests are compsed of scripts and tools used to perform static code analysis. 
The primary purpose of these tests is to enforce Ansible coding standards and requirements. 
Ansible collections must be in a specific path, as in the following example:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes, attributes"]
[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
{...}/ansible_collections/{namespace}/{collection}/
----

In addition to that specific path, you must have three directories:

* An empty directory named `ansible_collections`
* A directory for the namespace
* A directory for the collection itself

== Does {Galaxy} house the source code for my collection?

No, {Galaxy} does not house the source for the collections. 
The actual collection source must be housed outside of {Galaxy}, for example, in GitHub. 
{Galaxy} contains the collection build tarball to publish the collection. 
You can include the link to the source for community users in the `galaxy.yml` file contained in the collection. 
This shows users where they can go if they want to contribute to the collection or even file issues against it.

== Does Red Hat officially support collections downloaded and installed from {Galaxy}

No, collections downloaded from Galaxy do not have any support claims associated and are 100% community supported.
Users and contributors of these collections must contact the collection developers directly.

== How does the joint support agreement on Certified Collections work?

If a customer raises an issue with the Red Hat support team about a certified collection, Red Hat support assesses the issue and checks whether the problem exists within Ansible or Ansible usage. 
They also check whether the issue is with a certified collection. 
If there is a problem with the certified collection, support teams transfer the issue to the vendor owner of the certified collection through an agreed upon tool such as TSANet.

== Can I create and certify a collection containing only Ansible Roles?

You can create and certify collections that contain only roles. 
Current testing requirements are focused on collections containing modules, and additional resources are currently in progress for testing collections only containing roles. 
Contact ansiblepartners@redhat.com for more information.
