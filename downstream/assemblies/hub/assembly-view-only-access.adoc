= {PrivateHubNameStart} view-only access

By enabling view-only access, you can grant access for users to view collections or namespaces on your {PrivateHubName} without requiring them to log in. View-only access allows you to share content with unauthorized users while restricting their ability to only view or download source code, without permissions to edit anything on your {PrivateHubName}.
