= Managing namespaces

[role="_abstract"]
Namespaces are unique locations in {HubName} to which you can upload and publish content collections. Namespace access is governed by teams with permission to manage the content and related information that appears there.

You can use namespaces in {HubName} to organize collections developed within your organization for internal distribution and use.

If you are working with namespaces, you must have a team that has permissions to create, edit and upload collections to namespaces. Collections uploaded to a namespace require administrative approval before you can publish them and make them available for use.
