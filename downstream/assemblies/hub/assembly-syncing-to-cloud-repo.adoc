= Configuring {HubNameMain} remote repositories to synchronize content

:context: cloud-sync

Use remote configurations to configure your {PrivateHubName} to synchronize with {CertifiedName} hosted on `{Console}` or with your collections in {Galaxy}.

Each remote configuration located in {MenuACAdminRemotes} provides information for both the *community* and *rh-certified* repository about when the repository was *last updated*.
You can add new content to {HubNameMain} at any time using the *Edit* and *Sync* features included on the {MenuACAdminRepositories} page.

== What's the difference between {Galaxy} and {HubNameMain}?

Collections published to {Galaxy} are the latest content published by the Ansible community and have no joint support claims associated with them. 
{Galaxy} is the recommended frontend directory for the Ansible community to access content.

Collections published to {HubNameMain} are targeted to joint customers of Red Hat and selected partners. 
Customers need an Ansible subscription to access and download collections on {HubNameMain}. 
A certified collection means that Red Hat and partners have a strategic relationship in place and are ready to support joint customers, and that the collections may have had additional testing and validation done against them.

== How do I request a namespace on {Galaxy}?

To request a namespace through an {Galaxy} GitHub issue, follow these steps:

* Send an email to ansiblepartners@redhat.com 
* Include the GitHub username used to sign up on {Galaxy}.

You must have logged in at least once for the system to validate.

After users are added as administrators of the namespace, you can use the self-serve process to add more administrators.

== Are there any restrictions for {Galaxy} namespace naming?

Collection namespaces must follow Python module name convention. 
This means collections should have short, all lowercase names. 
You can use underscores in the collection name if it improves readability.
