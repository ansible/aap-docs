= Configuring {HubNameMain} remote repositories to synchronize content

Use remote configurations to configure your {PrivateHubName} to synchronize with {CertifiedName} hosted on `{Console}` or with your collections in {Galaxy}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
As of the 2.4 release you can still synchronize content, but synclists are deprecated, and will be removed in a future version.

To synchronize content, you can now upload a manually-created requirements file from the rh-certified remote. 

Remotes are configurations that allow you to synchronize content to your custom repositories from an external collection source.

== Whatâ€™s the difference between {Galaxy} and {HubNameMain}?

Collections published to {Galaxy} are the latest content published by the Ansible community and have no joint support claims associated with them. 
{Galaxy} is the recommended frontend directory for the Ansible community accessing content.

Collections published to {HubNameMain} are targeted for joint customers of Red Hat and selected partners. 
Customers need an Ansible subscription to access and download collections on {HubNameMain}. 
A certified collection means that Red Hat and partners have a strategic relationship in place and are ready to support joint customers, and may have had additional testing and validation done against them.

== How do I request a namespace on {Galaxy}?

To request a namespace through an {Galaxy} GitHub issue, follow these steps:

* Send an email to ansiblepartners@redhat.com 
* Include the GitHub username used to sign up on {Galaxy}.

You must have logged in at least once for the system to validate.

After users are added as administrators of the namespace, you can use the self-serve process to add more administrators.

== Are there any restrictions for {Galaxy} namespace naming?

Collection namespaces must follow python module name convention. 
This means collections should have short, all lowercase names. 
You can use underscores in the collection name if it improves readability.
