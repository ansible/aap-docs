= Synchronizing Ansible Content Collections in {HubName}

[IMPORTANT]
====
As of the 2.4 release you can still synchronize content, but synclists are deprecated, and will be removed in a future version.

To synchronize content, you can now upload a manually-created requirements file from the rh-certified remote.

Remotes are configurations that enable you to synchronize content to your custom repositories from an external collection source.
====

You can use {HubNameMain} to distribute the relevant {CertifiedColl}s to your users by creating synclists or a requirements file. For more information about using requirements files, see link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections_guide/collections_installing.html#install-multiple-collections-with-a-requirements-file[Install multiple collections with a requirements file] in the _Using Ansible collections_ guide.
