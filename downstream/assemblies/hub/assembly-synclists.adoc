= Synchronizing Ansible Content Collections in {HubName}

[IMPORTANT]
====
To synchronize content, you can now upload a manually-created requirements file from the rh-certified remote.
Remotes are configurations that enable you to synchronize content to your custom repositories from an external collection source.

As of the 2.4 release you can still synchronize content, but synclists are deprecated, and will be removed in a future version.
