As a content creator, you can use namespaces in {HubName} to curate and manage collections by doing the following:
* Creating groups with permissions to curate namespaces and upload collections to it.
* Adding information and resources to the namespace to help end users of the collection in their automation tasks.
* Uploading collections to the namespace.
* Reviewing the namespace import logs to determine the success or failure of uploading the collection and its current approval status.
