= Populating your {PrivateHubName} container registry


:context: populate-container-registry


[role="_abstract"]
By default, {PrivateHubName} does not include {ExecEnvName}.
To populate your container registry, you must push an {ExecEnvShort} to it.

You must follow a specific workflow to populate your {PrivateHubName} remote registry:

* Pull {ExecEnvName} from the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog (registry.redhat.io)
* Tag them
* Push them to your {PrivateHubName} remote registry

[IMPORTANT]
====
Image manifests and filesystem blobs were both originally served directly from `registry.redhat.io` and `registry.access.redhat.com`.
As of 1 May 2023, filesystem blobs are served from `quay.io` instead.

* Ensure that the link:{URLPlanningGuide}/ref-network-ports-protocols_planning[Network ports and protocols] listed in _Table 6.4. Execution Environments (EE)_ are available to avoid problems pulling container images.

Make this change to any firewall configuration that specifically enables outbound connections to `registry.redhat.io` or `registry.access.redhat.com`.

Use the hostnames instead of IP addresses when configuring firewall rules.

After making this change you can continue to pull {ExecEnvShort}s from `registry.redhat.io` and `registry.access.redhat.com`. You do not require a `quay.io` login, or need to interact with the `quay.io` registry directly in any way to continue pulling Red Hat container images.

If you are using Red Hat Satellite Server, follow the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_satellite/6.15/html/managing_content/managing_red_hat_subscriptions_content-management#Importing_a_Red_Hat_Subscription_Manifest_into_Server_content-management[procedure in the Red Hat Satellite documentation to import a subscription manifest into Satellite Server].
