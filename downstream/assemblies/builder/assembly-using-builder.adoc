= Using {Builder}

[role="_abstract"]
{Builder} is a command line tool that automates the process of building {ExecEnvName} by using metadata defined in various Ansible Collections or created by the user.

[NOTE]
====
You must build an {ExecEnvShort} before you can create it using {ControllerName}. 
After building it, you must push it to a repository (such as quay) and then, when creating an {ExecEnvShort} in the UI with {ControllerName}, you must point to that repository to use it in {PlatformNameShort} to use it, for example, in a job template.
