* {ControllerNameStart} and any instance group nodes associated with an organization service account specified in  '/inventory'  must be running on a RHEL 8.4 virtual machine.
* You have registered the RHEL 8.4 virtual machine with Red Hat Subscription Manager. Installation generates a certificate used to authenticate with cloud.redhat.com.
* You have attached the {PlatformNameShort} SKU to the Catalog Worker node.
* You have enabled SSH on the RHEL 8.4 virtual machine running the {CatalogName} worker.
* {ControllerNameStart} with at least one organization configured, including inventories, projects and job templates.
