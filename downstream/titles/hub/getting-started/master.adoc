= Getting started with automation hub

Red Hat Ansible {HubName} provides a place for Red Hat subscribers to quickly find and use content that is supported by Red Hat and our technology partners to deliver automation solutions for the most demanding environments.

The {Galaxy} client, `ansible-galaxy`, manages roles and collections from the command line.
To ensure that the `ansible-galaxy` client uses certified, supported Ansible collections whenever possible, update your `ansible.cfg` file to use Red Hat {HubName} as your primary source of Ansible collections.
