Removed features are those that were deprecated in earlier releases. They are now removed from the {PlatformNameShort}, and will no longer be supported. 

The following table provides information about features that are removed in {PlatformNameShort} 2.5:

[cols="20%,80%"]
|===
| Component | Feature

|{ControllerNameStart}
|Proxy support for the {ControllerName} has been removed. Load balancers must now point to the platform gateway instead of the controller. 

|ansible-lint
|Support for old Ansible `include` tasks syntax is removed in version 2.16 and moved to `include_tasks` or `import_tasks`. Update content to use the currently-supported Ansible syntax, like link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/include_tasks_module.html[include_tasks] or link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/import_tasks_module.html#ansible-collections-ansible-builtin-import-tasks-module[import_tasks]. 

|{EDAcontroller}
|Tokens for the {EDAcontroller} are deprecated. Their configuration has been removed from rulebook activations, and they have been replaced with the {PlatformNameShort} credential type.

|Ansible-core
|Support for Windows Server versions 2012 and 2012 R2 is removed, as Microsoft's supported end-of-life date is 10 October 2023. These versions of Windows Server are not tested in the {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 release. Red Hat does not guarantee that these features will continue to work as expected in this and future releases.

|In the Action plugin with an *ActionBase* class, the deprecated `_remote_checksum` method is now removed. Use `_execute_remote_stat` instead.

|Ansible-core
|The `include` module that was deprecated in ansible-core 2.12 is now removed. Use `include_tasks` or `import_tasks` instead.

|Ansible-core

|Ansible-core
|`fetch_url` - Removed auto disabling `decompress` when gzip is not available.
