= Changed features

Changed features are not deprecated and will continue to be supported until further notice. 

The following table provides information about features that are changed in {PlatformNameShort} 2.5:

[cols="20%,80%"]
|===
| Component | Feature

|{HubNameStart}
|Error codes are now changed from 403 to 401. Any API client usage relying on specific status code 403 versus 401 will have to update their logic. Standard UI usage will work as expected.

|{EDAName}
|The endpoints `/extra_vars` are now moved to a property within `/activations`. 

|{EDAName}
|The endpoint `/credentials` was replaced with `/eda-credentials`. This is part of an expanded credentials capability for {EDAName}. For more information, see the chapter link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.4/html/event-driven_ansible_controller_user_guide/eda-credentials[Setting up credentials for {EDAcontroller}] in the _{EDAcontroller} user guide_.

|{EDAName}
|{EDAName} can no longer add, edit, or delete the {Gateway}-managed resources. Creating, editing, or deleting organizations, teams, or users is available through {Gateway} endpoints only. The {Gateway} endpoints also enable you to edit organization or team memberships and configure external authentication. 

|API
|Auditing of users has now changed. Users are now audited through the platform API, not through the controller API. This change applies to the {PlatformNameShort} in both cloud service and on-premise deployments.  

|{ControllerNameStart}, +
{HubName}, +
{Gateway}, and +
{EDAName}
|User permission audits the sources of truth for the {Gateway}. When an IdP (SSO) is used, then the IdP should be the source of truth for user permission audits. When the {PlatformNameShort} {Gateway} is used without SSO, then the {Gateway} should be the source of truth for user permissions, not the app-specific UIs or APIs.
