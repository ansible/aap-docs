= New features and enhancements

== Installation changes
Starting with {PlatformNameShort} 2.5, three different on-premise deployment models are fully tested. In addition to the existing RPM-based installer and operator, support for the containerized installer is being added. 

As the platform moves toward a container-first model, the RPM-based installer will be removed in a future release, and a deprecation warning is being issued with the release of {PlatformNameShort} 2.5. While the RPM installer will still be supported for {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 until it is removed, the investment will focus on the {ContainerBase} for RHEL deployments and the {OperatorBase} for OpenShift deployments. Upgrades from 2.4 containerized {PlatformNameShort} Technology Preview to 2.5 containerized {PlatformNameShort} are unsupported. 

== Deployment topologies
Red Hat tests {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 with a defined set of topologies to give you opinionated deployment options. Deploy all components of {PlatformNameShort} so that all features and capabilities are available for use without the need to take further action.

It is possible to install {PlatformNameShort} on different infrastructure topologies and with different environment configurations. Red Hat does not fully test topologies outside of published reference architectures. Red Hat recommends using a tested topology for all new deployments and provides commercially reasonable support for deployments that meet minimum requirements.  

At the time of the {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 GA release, a limited set of topologies are fully tested. Red Hat will regularly add new topologies to iteratively expand the scope of fully tested deployment options. As new topologies roll out, we will include them in the release notes. 

The following table shows the tested topologies for {PlatformNameShort} 2.5:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Mode | Infrastructure | Description | Tested topologies

|RPM | Virtual Machines/Bare Metal | The RPM installer deploys the {PlatformNameShort} on {RHEL} using RPMs to install the platform on host machines. Customers manage the product and infrastructure lifecycle.
a| 
* RPM {GrowthTopology}
* RPM {EnterpriseTopology}

|Containers | Virtual Machines/Bare Metal | The containerized installer deploys the {PlatformNameShort} on {RHEL} by using Podman that runs the platform in containers on host machines. Customers manage the product and infrastructure lifecycle.
a| 
* Container {GrowthTopology}
* Container {EnterpriseTopology}

|Operator | Red Hat OpenShift | The operator uses Red Hat OpenShift operators to deploy the {PlatformNameShort} within Red Hat OpenShift. Customers manage the product and infrastructure lifecycle.
a| 
* Operator {GrowthTopology}
* Operator {EnterpriseTopology}

== Unified UI
In versions before 2.5, the {PlatformNameShort} was split into three primary services: {ControllerName}, {HubName}, and {EDAcontroller}. Each service included standalone user interfaces, separate deployment configurations, and separate authentication schemas.

In {PlatformNameShort} 2.5, the {Gateway} is provided as a service that handles authentication and authorization for the {PlatformNameShort}. With the {Gateway}, all services that make up the {PlatformNameShort} are consolidated into a single unified UI. The unified UI provides a single entry into the {PlatformNameShort} and serves the platform user interface to authenticate and access all of the {PlatformNameShort} services from a single location.




=== Terminology changes

The Unified UI highlights the functional benefits provided by each underlying service. New UI terminology aligns to earlier names as follows:

* *Automation execution* provides functionality from the *{ControllerName}* service
* *Automation decisions* provides functionality from the *{EDAName}* service
* *Automation content* provides functionality from the *{HubName}* service

== {EDAName} functionality (Automation decisions)
With {PlatformNameShort} 2.5, {EDAName} functionality has been enhanced with the following features:

* Enterprise single-sign on and role-based access control are available through a new {PlatformNameShort} UI, which enables a single point of authentication and access to all functional components as follows: 
** Automation Execution ({ControllerName})
** Automation Decision ({EDAName})
** Automation Content ({HubName})
** Automation Analytics
** Access Management
** {LightspeedShortName}

* Simplified event routing capabilities introduce event streams. Event streams are an easy way to connect your sources to your rulebooks. This new capability lets you create a single endpoint to receive alerts from an event source and then use the events in multiple rulebooks. This simplifies rulebook activation setup, reduces maintenance demands, and helps lower risk by eliminating the need for additional ports to be open to external traffic. 

* {EDAName} in the {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 now supports horizontal scaling, allowing you to install multiple {EDAName} nodes to handle increased event volume. 

* Migration to the new platform-wide {PlatformName} credential type replaces the legacy controller token for enabling rulebook activations to call jobs in the {ControllerName}.

* {EDAName} now has the ability to manage credentials that can be added to rulebook activations. These credentials can be used in rulebooks to authenticate to event sources. In addition, you can now attach vault credentials to rulebook activations so that you can use vaulted variables in rulebooks. Encrypted credentials and vaulted variables enable enterprises to secure the use of {EDAName} within their environment.

* New modules are added to the *ansible.eda* collection to enable users to automate the configuration of the {EDAcontroller} using Ansible playbooks.

[id="eda-2.5-with-automation-controller-2.4"]
== {EDAName} 2.5 with {ControllerName} 2.4
You can use a newly installed version of {EDAName} from {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 with some existing versions of the {ControllerName}. A hybrid configuration is supported with the following versions:

* 2.4 {PlatformNameShort} version of {ControllerName} (4.4 or 4.5)
* 2.5 {PlatformNameShort} version of {EDAName} (1.1)

You can only use new installations of {EDAName} in this configuration. RPM-based hybrid deployments are fully supported by Red Hat. For details on setting up this configuration, see the chapter *Installing {EDAController} 1.1 and configuring {ControllerName} 4.4 or 4.5* in the link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.4/html/using_event-driven_ansible_2.5_with_ansible_automation_platform_2.4[Using Event-Driven Ansible 2.5 with Ansible Automation Platform 2.4] guide.

A hybrid configuration means you can install a new {EDAName} service and configure rulebook activations to execute job templates on a 2.4 version of the {ControllerName}.

== {LightspeedShortName} on-premise deployment 
{LightspeedFullName} is a generative AI service that helps automation teams create, adopt, and maintain Ansible content more efficiently; it is now available as an on-premise deployment on the {PlatformNameShort} 2.5. 

The on-premise deployment provides the {PlatformNameShort} customers more control over their data and supports compliance with enterprise security policies. For example, organizations in sensitive industries with data privacy or air-gapped requirements can use on-premise deployments of both {LightspeedShortName} and {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} for {LightspeedShortName} on Cloud Pak for Data. {LightspeedShortName} on-premise deployments are supported on {PlatformNameShort} 2.5. For more information, see the chapter link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_lightspeed_with_ibm_watsonx_code_assistant/2.x_latest/html-single/red_hat_ansible_lightspeed_with_ibm_watsonx_code_assistant_user_guide/index#configuring-lightspeed-onpremise_set-up-lightspeed[Setting up {LightspeedShortName} on-premise deployment] in the _{LightspeedFullName} User Guide_.

== {AAPRHDH}
