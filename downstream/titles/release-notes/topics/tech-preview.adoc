// The following are Technology Preview features: 

// * Starting with {PlatformNameShort} 2.4, the Platform Resource Operator can be used to create the following resources in {ControllerName} by applying YAML to your OpenShift cluster:
// ** Inventories
// ** Projects
// ** Instance Groups
// ** Credentials
// ** Schedules
// ** Workflow Job Templates
// ** Launch Workflows

// You can now configure the Controller Access Token for each resource with the `connection_secret` parameter, rather than the `tower_auth_secret` parameter. This change is compatible with earlier versions, but the `tower_auth_secret` parameter is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.


=== Availability of {AAPchatbot}

The {AAPchatbot} is now available on {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 on {OCP} as a Technology Preview release. It is an intuitive chat interface embedded within the {PlatformNameShort}, utilizing generative artificial intelligence (AI) to answer questions about the {PlatformNameShort}.

The chat experience in the {AAPchatbot} interacts with users in their natural language prompts in English, and utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate quick, accurate, and personalized responses. These responses empower {PlatformNameShort} users to work more efficiently, thereby improving productivity and the overall quality of their work.

To access and use the {AAPchatbot}, you need:

* Installation of {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 on {OCP}.

* Deployment of an LLM served by Red Hat AI platforms.
