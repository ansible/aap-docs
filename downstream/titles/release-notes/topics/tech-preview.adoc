Ansible Lightspeed intelligent assistant integration with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server is now available as a Technology Preview release. This integration enhances the user experience by delivering relevant, dynamically sourced data results to your queries.

[NOTE]
====
{PlatformNameShort} 2.6 does not include general access to Ansible-core 2.19, but it can still be used with the platform.

This link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7128367[technical preview] includes an overhaul of the templating system and a new feature labeled Data Tagging. These changes enable reporting of numerous problematic behaviors that went undetected in previous releases, with wide-ranging positive effects on security, performance, and user experience.

Backward compatibility has been preserved where practical, but some breaking changes were necessary. This guide describes some common problem scenarios with example content, error messages, and suggested solutions.

We recommend you test your playbooks and roles in a staging environment with this release to determine where you may need to make changes.
