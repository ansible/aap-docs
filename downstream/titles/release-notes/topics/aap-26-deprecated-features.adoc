[cols="20%,80%"]

| Component | Feature

|Access to service APIs for
{ControllerName}, 
{HubName}, 
and {EDAName}
|With the addition of {Gateway}, a number of service-specific API endpoints are deprecated because their functionality will be removed or superseded with other capabilities in a future release. 

{PlatformNameShort} 2.5 and {PlatformVers} expose API access to individual services ({ControllerName}, {PrivateHubName}, {EDAName}) to maintain compatibility with existing REST API integrations. This access will be removed in a future release.

For detailed information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.6/html/planning_your_upgrade/upgrade-api-changes[API changes] in _Planning your upgrade_.

|Installer
|The {PlatformNameShort} installer using {RHEL} RPMs was deprecated (announced) in 2.5 and will be removed in {PlatformNameShort} 2.7.  

The RPM installer will be supported for {RHEL} 9 during the lifecycle of {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers} to support migrations to existing supported topologies. Users are encouraged to migrate to the containerized topology on {RHEL} or to the {OCPShort} Operator installation method. See the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.6/html/planning_your_upgrade/upgrade-support-matrix[support matrix] for more information on upgrade and migration paths.
