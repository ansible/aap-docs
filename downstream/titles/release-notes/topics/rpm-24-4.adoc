== General

* Fixed conditional code statements to align with changes from ansible-core issue #82295 (AAP-19099).

* Fixed an issue which caused the `update-ca-trust` handler to be skipped for execution nodes in controller (AAP-18911).

* Improved the error pages for {ControllerName} (AAP-18840).

* Implemented `libffi` fix to avoid `uWSGI` core dumps on failed import (AAP-18196).

* Fixed an issue with checking the license type following an upgrade caused by earlier incomplete upgrade (AAP-17615).

* Postgres certificates are now temporarily copied when checking the Postgres version for SSL mode `verify-full` (AAP-15374).
