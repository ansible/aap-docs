= Overview of {PlatformName}

{PlatformNameShort} is a strategic automation platform that integrates comprehensive capabilities, a robust technology ecosystem, and flexible deployment options into a single solution. It allows customers to automate and orchestrate a series of workflows across domains for more efficient, resilient, and consistent IT operations at scale.

From the introduction of {PlatformNameShort} 2, our promise has been to deliver an automation platform experience that allows our customers to create the automation content they need with more efficiency, manage the resulting automated workflows more effectively, and scale those automated workflows with ease across domains and environments. We continue to strive to deliver on that promise with the release of {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers}. 

*Automate at scale on proven foundation*. {PlatformName} {PlatformVers} delivers new features, platform enhancements, and strategic integrations that will help you continue to build a resilient, trusted foundation for the next generation of IT operations. 

* *Unlock more value* with the new automation dashboard, which allows you to securely measure automation ROI, with customized tracking and reporting.
* *Operate more efficiently* with the new {AAPchatbot}, which harnesses generative AI to provide on-demand support, for a more intuitive platform experience. 
* *Achieve new levels of scale* with the self-service automation portal, which enables platform admins to quickly and easily scale automation service delivery to new users and teams.
 
Because your team is not just preparing for the future, you are automating for it.
