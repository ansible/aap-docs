|{GatewayStart}
|The determination for matching to existing user records upon login has changed from previous versions. The new process leverages email address as the primary matching criteria for existing user accounts across multiple authentication methods. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.6/html/access_management_and_authentication/index[Access Management] for more details. Within 2.5, each authentication method would result in a user record being created regardless of the email matching from the different IdP sources.
