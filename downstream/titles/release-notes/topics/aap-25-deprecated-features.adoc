The following table provides information about features that were deprecated in {PlatformNameShort} 2.5:

[cols="20%,80%"]
|===
| Component | Feature

|{ControllerNameStart}, +
{HubName}, and +
{EDAcontroller}
|Tokens for the {ControllerName} and the {HubName} are deprecated. If you want to generate tokens, use the platform gateway to create them. 

The platform gateway is the service that handles authentication and authorization for the {PlatformNameShort}. It provides a single entry into the {PlatformNameShort} and serves the platform user interface, so you can authenticate and access all of the {PlatformNameShort} services from a single location.

|{ControllerNameStart} and +
{HubName}
|All non-local authentications into the {ControllerName} and {HubName} are deprecated. Use the platform gateway to configure external authentications, such as SAML, LDAP, and RADIUS.

|Ansible-core
|The `INI` configuration option in the *COLLECTIONS_PATHS* is deprecated. Use the singular form *COLLECTIONS_PATH* instead.

|Ansible-core
|The environment variable *ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATHS* is deprecated. Use the singular form *ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH* instead.

|Ansible-core
|Old-style Ansible vars plug-ins that use the entry points `get_host_vars` or `get_group_vars` were deprecated in ansible-core 2.16, and will be removed in ansible-core 2.18. Update the Ansible plug-in to inherit from *BaseVarsPlugin* and define a `get_vars` method as the entry point.

|Ansible-core
|The *STRING_CONVERSION_ACTION* configuration option is deprecated as it is no longer used in the ansible-core code base.

|Ansible-core
|The *smart* option for setting a connection plug-in is being removed as its main purpose of choosing between SSH and Paramiko protocols is now irrelevant. Select an explicit connection plug-in instead. 

|Ansible-core
|The undocumented `vaultid` parameter in the `vault` and `unvault` filters is deprecated and will be removed in ansible-core version 2.20. Use `vault_id` instead. 

|Ansible-core
|The string parameter `keepcache` in the `yum_repository` is deprecated.

|Ansible-core
|The `required` parameter in the API `ansible.module_utils.common.process.get_bin_path` is deprecated.

|Ansible-core
|`module_utils` - Importing the following convenience helpers from `ansible.module_utils.basic` has been deprecated: +
`get_exception`, `literal_eval`, `_literal_eval`, `datetime`, `signal`, `types`, `chain`, `repeat`, `PY2`, `PY3`, `b`, `binary_type`, `integer_types`, `iteritems`, `string_types`, `test_type`, `map`, and `shlex_quote`. +
Import the helpers from the source definition.

|Ansible-core
|`ansible-doc` - Role `entrypoint` attributes are deprecated and eventually will no longer be shown in `ansible-doc` from ansible-core.

|{ExecEnvNameStartSing}
|Execution environment-29 will be deprecated in the next major release after {PlatformNameShort} 2.5.

|Installer
|The Ansible team is exploring ways to improve the installation of the {PlatformNameShort} on {RHEL}, which may include changes to how components are deployed using RPM directly on the host OS. RPMs will be replaced by packages deployed into containers that are run via Podman; this is similar to how automation currently executes on Podman in containers (execution environments) on the host OS. Changes will be communicated through release notes, but removal will occur in major release versions of the {PlatformNameShort}.

|===


== Deprecated API endpoints

API endpoints that will be removed in a future release either because their functionality is being removed or superseded with other capabilities. For example, with the platform moving to a centralized authentication system in the platform gateway, the existing authorization APIs in the {ControllerName} and {HubName} are being deprecated for future releases as all authentication operations should occur in the platform gateway.

[cols="25%,25%,50%"]
|===
| Component | Endpoint | Capability

|{ControllerNameStart}
|`*/api/o*`
|Token authentication is moving to the platform gateway.

|{HubNameStart}
|`*/api/login/keycloak*`
|Moving to the platform gateway.

|{HubNameStart}
|`*/api/v3/auth/token*`
|Token authentication used for pulling collections will migrate to the platform gateway tokens.

|{ControllerNameStart}
|`*/api/v2/organizations*`
|Moving to the platform gateway.

|{ControllerNameStart}
|`*/api/v2/teams*`
|Moving to the platform gateway.

|{ControllerNameStart}
|`*/api/v2/users*`
|Moving to the platform gateway.
