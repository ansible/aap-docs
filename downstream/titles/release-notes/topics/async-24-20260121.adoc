== Deprecation

=== Execution Environment

`Openvswitch.openvswitch` collection has been deprecated for two years and is no longer certified. It has been removed from {HubNameStart}, but is still available from `Galaxy.ansible.com`. It remains in `ee-supported` for {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 and {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 for a brief transition period, but will be removed in a future release. The collection was never included in {PlatformNameShort} 2.6 so no impact on that release for this change. 


== Bug fixes

=== {PlatformNameShort}

* Fixed an issue where jobs from other templates occasionally appeared on the template jobs page.(AAP-59615)

* Fixed an issue where the {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 constructed inventory could only add 25 source inventories.(AAP-59568)

* Fixed an issue where there was an excess number of API calls while scrolling through job output.(AAP-58255)

=== {ControllerNameStart}

* Fixed an issue where after upgrading {PlatformNameShort} to the latest 2.4 version, no `awx.analytics.system_tracking` logger was being registered.(AAP-60506)
