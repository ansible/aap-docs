// This is the release notes for AAP 2.5 documentation, the version number is removed from the topic title as part of the release notes restructuring efforts.

= {PlatformNameShort} documentation

{PlatformName} 2.5 documentation includes significant feature updates as well as documentation enhancements and offers an improved user experience. 

The following are documentation enhancements in {PlatformNameShort} 2.5:

* The _Setting up an {ControllerName} token_ chapter that previously existed has been deprecated and replaced with the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.5/html-single/using_automation_decisions/index#eda-set-up-rhaap-credential-type[Setting up a Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform credential] topic. As the {EDAcontroller} is now integrated with centralized authentication and the Platform UI, this method simplifies the authentication process required for rulebook activations moving forward. 

* Documentation changes for 2.5 reflect terminology and product changes. Additionally, we have consolidated content into fewer documents.

The following table summarizes title changes for the 2.5 release.

// Per call with Lynne Maynard on Mon. 23 Sept., the ask is to hold off on adding hyperlinks to the individual doc guides for 30 Sept. release as there have been many updates in the guide names and we don't want broken links issues. This is to be reconsidered in the next update, ie, update 1. Therefore, I have used "title attributes" and not "link attributes" for the guides.
