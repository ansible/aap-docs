= {PlatformNameShort} documentation

{PlatformName} 2.5 documentation includes significant feature updates as well as documentation enhancements and offers an improved user experience. 

The following are documentation enhancements in {PlatformNameShort} 2.5:
* The “Setting up an automation controller token” chapter that previously existed has been deprecated and replaced with the current content in this section. As the Event-Driven Ansible controller is now integrated with centralized authentication and the Platform UI, this method simplifies the authentication process required for rulebook activations moving forward. 

* Documentation changes for 2.5 reflect terminology and product changes. Additionally, we have consolidated content into fewer documents. 

The following table summarizes title changes for the 2.5 release.
