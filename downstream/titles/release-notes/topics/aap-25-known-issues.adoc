== {EDAName}

* Python VS Code extension v2024.14.1 does not work in OpenShift Dev Spaces version 1.9.3, prohibiting the Ansible VS Code extension from loading. As a workaround, downgrade the Python VS Code extension version to 2024.12.3.

* The Ansible Content Creator *Get Started* page links do not work in OpenShift Dev Spaces version 1.9.3. As a workaround, use the Ansible VS Code Command Palette for the Ansible Content Creator features.
