This section provides information about known issues in {PlatformNameShort} 2.5.

== {PlatformNameShort}

* Added the `podman_containers_conf_logs_max_size` variable for *containers.conf* to control the max log size for Podman installations. The default value is 10 MiB. (AAP-12295)

* Setting the `pg_host=` value without any other context no longer results in an empty HOST section of the *settings.py* in the {ControllerName}. As a workaround, delete the `pg_host=` value or set it to `pg_host=''`. (AAP-31915) 

* Using *Prompt on launch* for variables for job templates, workflow job templates, workflow visualizer nodes, and schedules will not show the default variables when launching the job, or when configuring the workflows and schedules. (AAP-30585)

* The unused *ANSIBLE_BASE_* settings are included as environment variables in the job execution. These variables suffixed with *SECRET* are no longer used in the {PlatformNameShort} and might be ignored until they are removed in a future patch. (AAP-32208)

== {EDAName}

* mTLS event stream creation should be disallowed on all installation methods by default. It is currently disallowed on {OCPShort} installation, but not disallowed in the containerized installations or on RPM installations. (AAP-31337)

* If a primary Redis node enters a `failed` state and a new primary node is promoted, {EDAName} workers and scheduler are unable to reconnect to the cluster. This causes activations to fail until the containers or pods are recycled. (AAP-30722) +
For more information, see the KCS article link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7088545[Redis failover causes {EDAName} activation failures].

== {AAPRHDH}

* Python VS Code extension v2024.14.1 does not work in OpenShift Dev Spaces version 1.9.3, prohibiting the Ansible VS Code extension from loading. As a workaround, downgrade the Python VS Code extension version to 2024.12.3.

* The Ansible Content Creator *Get Started* page links do not work in OpenShift Dev Spaces version 1.9.3. As a workaround, use the link:https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#:~:text=VS%20Code%20is%20equally%20accessible,for%20the%20most%20common%20operations[Ansible VS Code Command Palette] to access the features.
