* With this release, a redirect page has now been implemented that will be exhibited when you navigate to the root `/` for each component's stand-alone URL. The API endpoint remains functional. This affects {EDAName}, {ControllerName}, {OperatorPlatformNameShort}, and {OCPShort}.


== Bug fixes

=== {PlatformNameShort}

* Fixed an issue where the user was unable to filter out hosts on inventory groups where it returned a *Failed to load* options on {PlatformNameShort} UI.(AAP-34752)

=== Execution Environment

* Update *pywinrm* to 0.4.3 in *ee-minimal* and *ee-supported* container images to fix Python 3.11 compatibility.(AAP-34077)

=== {OperatorPlatformNameShort}

* Fixed a syntax error when `bundle_cacert_secret` was defined due to incorrect indentation.(AAP-35358)

* Fixed an issue where the default operator catalog for {PlatformNameShort} aligned to cluster-scoped versus namespace-scoped.(AAP-35313)

* Added the ability to set tolerations and `node_selector` for the Redis *statefulset* and the gateway deployment.(AAP-33192)

* Ensure the platform URL status is set when *Ingress* is used to resolve an issue with {Azure} on Cloud managed deployments. This is due to the {PlatformNameShort} operator failing to finish because it is looking for {OCPShort} routes that are not available on Azure Kubernetes Service.(AAP-34036)

* Fixed an issue where the {PlatformNameShort} Operator description did not render code block correctly.(AAP-34589)

* It is necessary to specify the `CONTROLLER_SSO_URL` and `AUTOMATION_HUB_SSO_URL` settings in Gateway to fix the OIDC auth redirect flow.(AAP-34080)

* It is necessary to set the `SERVICE_BACKED_SSO_AUTH_CODE_REDIRECT_URL` setting to fix the OIDC auth redirect flow.(AAP-34079)

=== Container-based {PlatformNameShort}

* Fixed an issue when the port value was not defined in the `gateway_main_url` variable, the containerized installer failed with incorrect {ExecEnvShort} image reference error.(AAP-34716)

* Fixed an issue where the containerized installer used port number when specifying the `image_url` for a decision environment. The user should not add a port to image URLs when using the default value.(AAP-34070)

* Fixed an issue where not setting up the *gpg* agent socket properly when multiple hub nodes are configured resulted in not creating a *gpg* socket file in `/var/run/pulp`.(AAP-34067)

* Fixed an issue where missing data files were not included in the molecule RPM package.(AAP-35758)
