* Reduce cognitive complexity `in _sync_user_superuser_flag`.(AAP-62771)


=== Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue preventing gateway from working in a pure IPv4 single stack environment when IPv6 is enabled.(AAP-60478)

* Fixed an issue where the UI did not allow for full search in resource dropdowns.(AAP-57712)

* Fixed an issue that occasionally showed a bad request status when navigating between different pages in {PlatformNameShort}.(AAP-56701)

* Fixed an issue where searching for a collection by name returned incorrect results. Fixed the filtering by name in the *Collections* page.(AAP-56529)

* Fixed an issue where the user could not edit the *Client Certificate* and/or *Client Key* fields of a credential once set.(AAP-55296)

* Fixed an issue where the workflow job templates node credentials were missing after save for job template nodes that have a default credential that is promptable.(AAP-52638)

* Fixed an issue where the {Gateway} UI reset the order of an authentication mapping when the entity was edited by the user.(AAP-52258)

* Fixed an issue where {ControllerName} unavailability rendered the entire {PlatformNameShort} UI inaccessible. The UI now remains functional during {ControllerName} outages, displaying a notification banner to alert users.(AAP-50106)

* Fixed an issue where the descriptions for the *Remotes* and *Remote Registries* were not accurate.(AAP-49838)

* Fixed an issue where the survey text area *Default Answer* field did not properly accept newlines when pressing Enter.(AAP-49820)

* Fixed an issue where the *Review* page of the add *Approval* node in workflow job template did not load.(AAP-49433)

* Fixed an issue where *Days of Data to Keep* is missing from *Edit Cleanup Job* schedule page.(AAP-48972)

* Fixed an issue where editing and saving credentials that use external credential lookup plugins (such as CyberArk) failed with an error message. Users can now successfully modify and save these credentials as expected.(AAP-44813)

* Fixed an issue where the SAML Service Provider extra configuration data field could not be cleared in the UI, as it would automatically reset to the default value. Users can now set this field to null, which is required for compatibility with certain identity providers.(AAP-43661)

* Fixed an issue where ad-hoc commands failed with a *Bad Request* error when using credentials configured with prompt on launch for password fields. The *Run Command* wizard now correctly displays a credential passwords step to collect required passwords before executing the command.(AAP-43603)


=== Deprecated

* Feature flag `FEATURE_GATEWAY_IPV6_USAGE_ENABLED` has been removed. IPv6 is now supported by default.(AAP-61805)



== {ControllerNameStart}

=== Features

* Added runtime feature flags.(AAP-62686)


== {HubNameStart}

=== Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where  the password field on the {HubName} Django REST framework authentication page was missing the autocomplete attribute. As a consequence, the field did not align with security best practices regarding browser autofill. With this update, the password field uses the autocomplete="new-password" attribute. As a result, the {HubName} API authentication page now complies with recommended security settings.(AAP-59912)


== Container-based {PlatformNameShort}

=== Enhancements

* Added lTLS support to lightspeed chatbot service.(AAP-60900)

=== Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the system-prompt optimized for granite and OpenAI models.(AAP-60898)

* Fixed an issue where the ansiblemcp uninstall is failing to stop containers


== {EDAName}

=== Features

* Added x-ai-description field to the activation PATCH method.(AAP-61969)

This enhancement adds a warning banner to the User Interface (UI) for the "restart", "disable", and "delete" workflows, providing users with a clear warning before performing these actions. The feature also supports a force flag for the "disable" and "delete" operations, giving users the option to bypass the warning if necessary.(AAP-51378)

=== Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the IPv6 support in the {EDAName} operator configmaps was missing the extra listen *NGINX* directive. We added the required directive so the event streams pod now has *NGINX* bound to its IPv6 interface.(AAP-62001) 


== {LightspeedShortName}

=== Enhancements

* Enabled chatbot authentication.(AAP-61015)

* Supports {LightspeedShortName} chatbot authentication.(AAP-59478)

* Enabled chatbot authentication.(AAP-59476)

* The MCP service / endpoint now displays a banner that explains how to connect to the service, this banner replaces an error message.(AAP-59334)

* Implemented authentication between ansible-lightspeed and ansible-lightspeed-chatbot.(AAP-58796)

* Added chatbot authentication capabilities.(AAP-58794)

* Added Lightspeed chatbot TLS support.(AAP-54412)

* Fixed an issue where the Lightspeed Chatbot `PROVIDER_VECTOR_DB_ID` set to literal string caused degraded responses in production.(AAP-61118)

* Fixed bug where VS Code would throw a warning when connecting to {PlatformNameShort} MCP servers due to a period character being in the tool name.(AAP-59293)

* Fixed an issue where Ansible Lightspeed intelligent assistant showed raw tool_call output in answers.(AAP-57513)

* Fixed an issue where long tool names in the {PlatformNameShort} MCP server exceeding the 60-character limit in Cursor's MCP server resulted in the MCP server tools to being hidden in Cursor, impacting tool usage. With this release, the MCP server now supports tool names exceeding 60 characters, resolving the visibility and usability issues for all tools in the {PlatformNameShort} MCP server.(AAP-61149)

* Fixed an issue where ALIA was experiencing Database or Disk is Full errors.(AAP-53081)

* Fixed an issue where the `CHATBOT_API_KEY` environment variable was not passed to the container when the provider was azure/openai.(AAP-63292)
