= {PlatformNameShort} patch release October 7, 2024

The following enhancements and fixes have been implemented in this release of {PlatformName}.

== Enhancements

* {EDAName} workers and scheduler add timeout and retry resilience when communicating with a Redis cluster. (AAP-32139) 

* Removed the *MTLS* credential type that was incorrectly added. (AAP-31848)

== Fixed issues

=== {PlatformNameShort}

* Fixed conditional that was skipping necessary tasks in the restore role, which was causing restores to not finish reconciling. (AAP-30437)

* Systemd services in the containerized installer are now set with restart policy set to *always* by default. (AAP-31824)

* *FLUSHDB* is now modified to account for shared usage of a Redis database. It now respects access limitations by removing only those keys that the client has permissions to. (AAP-32138)

* Added a fix to ensure default *extra_vars* values are rendered in the *Prompt on launch* wizard. (AAP-30585)

* Filtered out the unused *ANSIBLE_BASE_* settings from the environment variable in job execution. (AAP-32208)


=== {EDAName}

* Configured the setting *EVENT_STREAM_MTLS_BASE_URL* to the correct default to ensure MTLS is disallowed in the RPM installer. (AAP-32027)

* Configured the setting *EVENT_STREAM_MTLS_BASE_URL* to the correct default to ensure MTLS is disallowed in the containerized installer. (AAP-31851)

* Fixed a bug where the {EDAName} workers and scheduler are unable to reconnect to the Redis cluster if a primary Redis node enters a *failed* state and a new primary node is promoted. See the KCS article link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7088545[Redis failover causes {EDAName} activation failures] that include the steps that were necessary before this bug was fixed. (AAP-30722)
