== Features

=== {PlatformNameShort}

* {PlatformNameShort} now supports service account-based authentication for integration with services available through the Hybrid Cloud Console, including automation analytics, {InsightsShort}, and subscription management. See this link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7112649[Knowledgebase article] for more information on the required changes.

* Replaced basic authenticate with service account authentication for {PlatformNameShort} subscription management.(AAP-44643)

* Updated the subscription wizard to accommodate fetching subscription information using service account credentials.(AAP-37077)

* Adds `ansible_base.lib.utils.address.classify_address` providing common recognition and parsing of machine addressing (hostname, IPv4 and IPv6) with and without an appended `:<port>`.(AAP-45287)


== Enhancements


=== {PlatformNameShort}

* Reduced the cognitive complexity level of `validate_password()` method and reorganized the `validate_authenticate_uid()` method to increase code readability.(AAP-45346)

* For clarity and to prevent misconfiguration, the SAML authenticator now requires both a permanent user ID and a username.(AAP-45333)

* Updated field names and help text in the System Settings UI to indicate client ID and client secret for service accounts, as well as client ID and client secret for analytics.(AAP-43119)

* Validation/enforcement of expected service types removed because service types are now dynamic.(AAP-40130)

* Enables configuration of control plane authentication for custom services. You should not modify it for pre-defined services.(AAP-40131)

* Custom service type support added. Arbitrary service types and services can be created rather than a fixed list.(AAP-39812)


=== {LightspeedShortName}

* It is now possible to access a practical approach to managing and automating AI infrastructure using {PlatformName}. Please refer to the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7117333[AI + Ansible Solution Guides].

* It is now possible to disable SSL verification for {LightspeedShortName} <-> Model Server communication.(AAP-45337)


=== {ControllerNameStart}

* Updated Azure Key Vault plugin to use managed identity when creating credentials.(AAP-43461)


== Bug fixes

With this update, the following CVEs have been addressed:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-43859[CVE-2025-43859] `ee-supported-container`: h11 accepts some malformed Chunked-Encoding bodies.(AAP-44783)

* link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-43859[CVE-2025-43859] `ee-cloud-services-container`: h11 accepts some malformed Chunked-Encoding bodies.(AAP-44781)

* link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-43859[CVE-2025-43859] `ansible-lightspeed-container`: h11 accepts some malformed Chunked-Encoding bodies.(AAP-44779)



=== {PlatformNameShort}

* Fixed an issue found in SaaS deployments where the authentication proxy would use old, invalid database connections after an RDS database reboot.(AAP-44178)

* Fixed an issue where administrators were not allowed to configure auto migration of legacy authenticators.(AAP-36841)

* Fixed an issue where the usernames from LDAP were not case-insensitive. LDAP is case-insensitive so logging in as <Bob> and <bob> would result in two different users in {Gateway} even though they are the same user in LDAP. With this change, both users will be authenticated as the lowercase username.(AAP-44177)



=== {OperatorPlatformNameShort}

* Fixed a broken document link to {OperatorPlatformNameShort} installation documents in the {OCPShort} UI.(AAP-45199)

* Fixed an issue where the user was unable configure `kind: AnsibleInstanceGroup`, and it failed with an error *policy_spec_override is undefined*.(AAP-45351)


=== {LightspeedShortName} 

* Fixed an issue where it was not possible to disable SSL verification between Model Server and {LightspeedShortName}.(AAP-45269)

* Fixed an issue where the provider type and context window size were not configurable in {LightspeedShortName} Operator.(AAP-45166)


=== {ControllerNameStart}

* Fixed an issue where the VMware credential was not applying to the source correctly.(AAP-45169)

* Fixed an issue where the workflow job template did not have job access parity with `UnifiedJobAccess`.(AAP-45057)

* Fixed an issue where error handling did not allow event processing to continue even if one event contained invalid data that cannot be parsed by `jq`.(AAP-44876)


=== {GatewayStart}

* Fixed `AttributeError` errors around the `legacy_base` authenticator which were harmless, but were showing in logs leading to customer and engineer confusion.(AAP-40159)

* Fixed an issue where customized proxy authentication on a per service cluster basis was not allowed.(AAP-35601)

* Fixed and issue where there was a server error on migrating an LDAP user in a freshly upgraded 2.4 -> 2.5 instance. The fix prevents the 500 error during LDAP user legacy authentication and migration following an upgrade.(AAP-44958)



=== RPM-based {PlatformNameShort}

* Fixed an issue the `max keyrings sysctl` would produce common failures when running more than 200 containers on a node.(AAP-45260)

* Fixed an issue where automation {Gateway} proxy (envoy) ports were not included in the firewall.(AAP-45489)


== Known Issues

* {LightspeedShortName} enabled deployments must apply a workaround to avoid problems during upgrade from release 2.5.20250507. The service cluster and related objects must be removed before upgrade and re-created after upgrade.
