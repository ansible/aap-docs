== General

=== *Stakeholder Notification: Ansible Lightspeed Release 2.6 Sign-Off Issue*

We are writing to inform you of an issue discovered during the final sign-off process for the Ansible Lightspeed 2.6 release that impacts a subset of customers.

=== Issue Description

Ansible Lightspeed customers who deploy using the {OCP} (OCP) installer will encounter a specific error when attempting to use the Chatbot feature to retrieve information about {PlatformNameShort}. This manifests as a *403 Forbidden error*.

A similar issue also affects customers who utilize the *containerized installer* with the *Enterprise topology*. Crucially, this issue *does not affect* customers using the containerized installer with the *Growth or All-in-One topology*.

=== Root Cause and Impact

The 403 error is caused by a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection mechanism not correctly recognizing the origin of the Chatbot's request in the affected deployment configurations. This prevents the Chatbot from functioning as intended for these specific customer segments.

=== Workaround

We have identified a viable workaround that can be implemented by affected customers immediately:

Customers must edit their `AnsibleAutomationPlatform` kind configuration to include a new `extra_setting` variable and wait for redeployment.

[cols="1a,2a,3a", options="header"]
|====
| Setting Name | Value | Action Required 

| `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`

| `<Ansible Automation Platform Gateway FQDN>`

| Modify the `AnsibleAutomationPlatform` kind and then wait for the changes to become effective.

|====

Example:
[source,python]
----
kind: AnsibleAutomationPlatform
  spec:
    lightspeed:
      extra_settings:
        - setting: CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS
          value: 'https://gateway-onprem-signoff-26.apps.aap-test2.w6n5.p1.openshiftapps.com'
----

[NOTE]
====
The `<Ansible Automation Platform Gateway FQDN>` should be replaced with the customer's actual Fully Qualified Domain Name for the AAP Gateway.
====

=== Next Steps

Our engineering team is prioritizing a permanent fix for this issue, which will be included in a forthcoming patch release. We will provide updates on the timeline for the fix shortly.

Please disseminate this information to your relevant customer-facing and support teams so they can proactively assist customers encountering this issue with the provided workaround.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support.

== {PlatformNameShort}

=== Features

* {PlatformNameShort} now provides support for IPv6 single-stack and dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) deployments in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, and RPM-based environments. Support for container-based environments will be introduced in a future patch release. To enable IPv6 in {PlatformNameShort}, set the FEATURE_GATEWAY_IPV6_USAGE_ENABLED feature flag to True. For more information about using feature flags, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7109282[How to set feature flags for {PlatformName}].(ANSTRAT-1575)

*Availability to deploy and configure Ansible MCP servers*

* Organization administrators can now deploy an Ansible Model Context Protocol (MCP) server on an operator-based or containerized installation of {PlatformNameShort} 2.6. This functionality is available as a Technology Preview release.

* Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI models to use external AI tools and services via a unified interface. 

* The following are the key capabilities:

** Using the Ansible MCP server, you can connect your {PlatformNameShort} with your preferred external AI tool (such as Claude, Cursor, or ChatGPT). The AI tools can access key information about your {PlatformNameShort} environment and perform tasks. 

** Ansible users can query information, execute workflows, and perform automation tasks using natural language prompts directly within their preferred AI tool.

[NOTE]
====
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process. For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview Features Support Scope].

=== Enhancements

* Fixed an issue with missing {PlatformNameShort} 2.6 repositories for {RHEL} 10, which previously prevented the successful build of devtools RPMs. This resulted in devtools failing to mirror {PlatformNameShort} 2.6 on {RHEL} 10. With this release, we have built the devtools RPMs for {RHEL} 10 on a dedicated channel which are now accessible to users.(AAP-53866)

* Fixed an issue where the OpenAPI specification for the {Gateway} REST API was not providing comprehensive documentation and detailed request/response schemas.(AAP-53643)

* Fixed an issue where the edit form for a survey would not display in the UI if the survey was created without a default value using the ansible.controller collection.(AAP-51548)

* Fixed an issue where the names of the labels and options in the Authentication mapping created confusion and were not user friendly.(AAP-51295)

Updated the messaging when job template creation is not available: Job template creation requires project access and the user is not currently assigned to any projects.(AAP-40800)

* Fixed an issue where the repository URL in the *Details* page was incorrect.(AAP-40160)

* Fixed a survey validation issue where the minimum length value of a question could be set to greater than the maximum length value.(AAP-39932)

* Fixed a survey validation issue where text was being treated as a number when evaluating its length.(AAP-39931)

* Fixed an issue where users were encountering an issue with `extra-vars` `number_list` containing more than 21 digits in non-quoted integer format, experiencing a UI display problem. Previously, the user interface incorrectly converted long numbers to scientific notation, making input difficult.(AAP-31805)


=== Deprecated

* The following endpoints have been deprecated for {PlatformNameShort}, MCP, and MVP in the OpenAPI Specifications;
** `UserViewSet` and `DeprecatedRelatedUserViewSet` are deprecated.
** `UserTeamViewSet` and `UserOrganizationViewSet` are deprecated.
** `authenticators` and `authenticator_uid` fields are deprecated in `UserSerializer`.(AAP-58322)


== {OperatorPlatformNameShort}

=== Enhancements

* Event-Driven Ansible event-stream mTLS configuration has been added to the installer.(AAP-58343)
* Added `spec_overrides` field to the restore CR spec:
** Added support for overriding Controller-specific settings via `spec_overrides.controller`.

** Added support for overriding {EDAName} specific settings via `spec_overrides.eda`.
** Added support for overriding database-specific settings via `spec_overrides.database`.(AAP-60024)

=== Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue with object storage secrets that were not included in the Automation Hub backup.(AAP-59610)

* Fixed the conditional failure for `AnsibleWorkflow` job launch when using the `AnsibleWorkflow` CR in {PlatformNameShort} 2.6.(AAP-59106)

* Fixed an issue where there was an {OCPShort} resource runner python library dependency missing from the container image.(AAP-59032)

* Fixed a server error that could happen when assigning permissions via the `/api/eda/` or `/api/controller/` endpoints.(AAP-58622)


== {ControllerNameStart}

=== Features

* Receptor collection version bumped to 2.0.8, which is compatible with {RHEL} 10.(AAP-58421)

* Added `x-ai-description` to controller schema to provide AI friendly description of each endpoint.(AAP-59819) 

=== Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where project update failed with no output, and project deletions failed. {ControllerNameStart} now uses the force flag when syncing a project which has *Allow branch override* enabled.(AAP-58533)

* In this update, users attempting to install a software package on an unsupported architecture may encounter issues due to incorrect data in reminders. This has been resolved.(AAP-59728)

* Fixed an issue where the project update failed with no output and project deletions also failed.(AAP-58533)

* Fixed an issue where the OpenAPI specification for the {ControllerNameStart} was incomplete, impeding MCP server integration development. This limited the seamless MCP server integration with the {PlatformNameShort}. The {ControllerNameStart}'s REST API is now complete and accessible.(AAP-53640)


== {HubNameStart}


=== Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue with {HubNameStart} authentication failure for users with the *Team Admin* role:
** Users assigned the *Team Admin* role can now successfully authenticate to {HubNameStart}. Previously, these users would receive a *401* error when accessing {HubNameStart} API endpoints due to an incompatibility between the *Team Admin* role and {HubNameStart}'s internal permission system.(AAP-58898)

* Fixed an issue where the password field on the {HubNameStart} Django REST framework authentication page was missing the autocomplete attribute. As a consequence, the field did not align with security best practices regarding browser autofill. With this update, the password field uses the `autocomplete="new-password"` attribute. As a result, the {HubNameStart} API authentication page complies with recommended security settings.(AAP-59910)

* Previously, upgrades from {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 to 2.6 failed when API access logging was enabled. This occurred due to an incorrect import path in the galaxy-ng package. This release corrects the import path.(AAP-59886)



== Container-based {PlatformNameShort}

=== Enhancements

* Configured podman PID limits, `sysctls` for `inotify` and kernel keys, and ulimit `nofile` for user running {PlatformNameShort} service containers based on system resources.(AAP-59438)

=== Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where after uninstall/re-install of receptor jobs were unable to start due to stale exited containers with the same name were still present.(AAP-59609)


== {EDAName}

=== Enhancements

* Added concise descriptions to API endpoints for {PlatformNameShort} MCP MVP endpoints (`x-ai-description`).(AAP-58431)

=== Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the OpenAPI specification for {EDAName} was not offering comprehensive documentation and detailed request/response schemas. Previously, developers integrating with {EDAName} via the MCP server had to manually explore APIs and format API calls without proper guidance, which impeded seamless integration. With this release, the OpenAPI specification for the {EDAName} REST API is now complete and well-documented. This enhancement enables seamless integration with the MCP server using Event-Driven Ansible.(AAP-53642)


== Lightspeed

=== Technical Preview

* This developer preview introduces support for Ansible MCP Servers.(AAP-57303)

* This new feature enables users to access the {PlatformNameShort} 2.6 API directly from AI tools like Claude Code.(AAP-57217)

=== Features

Added the new {PlatformNameShort} MCP Server to the 2.6 stream.(AAP-58863)

=== Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue of {PlatformNameShort} Multi-Channel Platform (MCP) servers crashing due to incomplete Epic and System Design Plan (SDP) creation, leading to unclear work requirements. As a result, the {PlatformNameShort} MCP Servers have created the System Design Plan and related tasks, addressing ANSTRAT-1567. This enhancement improves the efficiency of feature development for end users by completing the {PlatformNameShort} MCP Servers system design plan in an active manner.(AAP-53087)


== Receptor

=== Features

* Receptor collection version bumped to 2.0.8, which supports {RHEL} 10 mesh nodes.(AAP-57987)

=== Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the receptor-collection was not up to date with Automation hub standards. There is now an up to date Changelog included in receptor-collection.(AAP-58434)
