The following fixes have been implemented in this release of {PlatformName}.

== Fixed issues

=== {PlatformNameShort}

* Fixed an issue in {Gateway} where examining output logs for UWSGI shows a message that can be viewed as insensitive. (AAP-33213)

* Fixed external Redis port configuration issue, which resulted in a `cluster_host` error when trying to connect to Redis. (AAP-32691)

* Fixed a faulty conditional which was causing managed Redis to be deployed even if an external Redis was being configured. (AAP-31607)

* After the initial deployment of {PlatformNameShort}, if you make changes to the {ControllerName}, {HubName}, or {EDAName} sections of the {PlatformNameShort} CR specification, those changes are now propagated to the component custom resources. (AAP-32350)

* Fixed addressing issues when the filter `keep_keys` is used, all keys are removed from the dictionary. The `keepkey` fix is available in the updated `ansible.utils` collection. (AAP-32960)

* Fixed an issue in `cisco.ios.ios_static_routes` where the metric distance is to be populated in the `forward_router_address` attribute. (AAP-32960)

* Fixed an issue where {OperatorPlatformNameShort} is not transferring metric settings to the controller. (AAP-32073)

* Fixed an issue where you have a schedule on a resource, such as a job template, that prompts for credentials, and you update the credential to be different from what is on the resource by default, the new credential is not submitted to the API and it does not get updated. (AAP-31957)

* Fixed an issue where setting `*pg_host=` without any other context no longer results in an empty HOST section of `settings.py` in controller. (AAP-32440)
