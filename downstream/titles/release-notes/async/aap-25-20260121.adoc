== Deprecation

=== Execution Environment

`Openvswitch.openvswitch` collection has been deprecated for two years and is no longer certified. It has been removed from {HubNameStart}, but is still available from `Galaxy.ansible.com`. It remains in `ee-supported` for {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 for a brief transition period, but will be removed in a future release.(ACA-4941)
