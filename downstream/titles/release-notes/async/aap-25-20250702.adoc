* New installations of {LightspeedShortName} using the {PlatformNameShort} Custom Resource will automatically integrate with {PlatformNameShort}'s *OAuth* mechanism. The `auth_config_secret_name` setting is optional.(AAP-45686)

== {EDAName}

=== Features

* API REST supports the editing of the URL of the project.(AAP-47459)

* Prior to this release, we suggested utilizing `ansible.builtin.set_fact` within playbooks. We now advise using `ansible.builtin.set_stats` as it enables seamless integration with job templates. We encourage migrating from `ansible.builtin.set_fact` to `ansible.builtin.set_stats` for optimal results, although `ansible.builtin.set_fact` will continue to be supported.(AAP-46841)

=== Enhancements

* Previously, when a project `url/branch/scm_refspec` was edited, users had to manually trigger a project resync through either the UI or API. Now, {EDAName} automatically does a resync in case one of `url/branch/scm_refspec` is modified.(AAP-46254)

* Relevant settings and versions are emitted in logs when the worker starts.(AAP-40984)

=== Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue when using `gather_facts` in a rulebook a user had to provide an inventory. This is only available when running ansible-rulebook as a CLI. When the rulebook with `gather_facts` is run as part of Activation the `gather_facts` is ignored, since Activations does not include inventory.(AAP-47846)

* Fixed an issue where DE images that use an SHA digest in the URI would fail to pull. This is now addressed, enabling user reminders to be sent actively.(AAP-47725)

* Fixed an issue introduced in #1296 where we were running under the advisory lock and not the actual import/sync task, but the proxy that schedules the job for rq and `dispatcherd`.(AAP-47554)

* Fixed an issue where there were no validations to `URL`, `branch/tag/commit`, and `refspec` fields when creating or updating a project.(AAP-47227)

* Fixed an issue on k8s-based deployments where activations would hang while being deleted or disabled.(AAP-46559)

* Fixed an issue where the activation could get stuck in the *disabling* or *deleting* state under {OCPShort}.(AAP-45298)


== Receptor

=== Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where jobs were in a failed status with message *Receptor detail: Finished*. EOF is now handled correctly when the pod is ready.(AAP-46484)


== RPM-based {PlatformNameShort}

=== Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where redis-platform would not restart on restore.(AAP-47689)

* Fixed an issue where old service nodes were not removed from {Gateway} when the installer ran with a new host or new host names.(AAP-47651)

* Fixed an issue where restore was failing when a non-default port was used for {PlatformNameShort} managed database.(AAP-47639)

* Fixed an issue where some pages didn't render properly when non-default `umask` was being used.(AAP-47377)

* Fixed an issue where the {EDAName} script was not starting `nginx` on restart.(AAP-46511)

* Fixed an issue where the credentials associated to decision environments would not be updated with the site information defined in the source inventory during restore.(AAP-46271)
