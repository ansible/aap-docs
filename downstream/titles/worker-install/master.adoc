// Book Title
= Installing the {CatalogName} worker

You can extend {PlatformName} to connect to {CatalogName} on cloud.redhat.com by using the {PlatformNameShort} setup or setup bundle installer.

This is a Day 2 activity and requires setup of a *service account that has write permissions* on all basic resources and objects in {ControllerName}: organizations, users, projects, job templates and inventories.

The Catalog worker requires a set of variables assigned to hosts in your {PlatformName} network. Running the Catalog worker will create an application and an application token, install the necessary packages, and start the service.
