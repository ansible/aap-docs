// Book Title
= Enabling Red Hat Edge Manager

{RedHatEdge} aims to give simple, scalable, and secure management of edge devices and applications. 
You can declare the operating system version, host configuration, and set of applications that you want to run on an individual device or a whole fleet of devices.
{RedHatEdge} rolls out the target configuration to devices where a device agent automatically applies them and report progress and health status back up.
