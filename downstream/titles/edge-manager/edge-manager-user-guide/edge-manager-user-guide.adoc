= Managing device fleets with the Red Hat Edge Manager

The {RedHatEdge} aims to give simple, scalable, and secure management of edge devices and applications. 
You can declare the operating system version, host configuration, and set of applications that you want to run on an individual device or a whole fleet of devices.
The {RedHatEdge} rolls out the target configuration to devices where a device agent automatically applies them and reports progress and health status back up.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {RedHatEdge} is a Technology Preview feature only.
