// Book Title
= Using automation execution
  
Thank you for your interest in {PlatformName} {ControllerName}.
{ControllerNameStart} helps teams manage complex multitiered deployments by adding control, knowledge, and delegation to Ansible-powered environments.

Using {ControllerName} describes all of the functionality available in {ControllerName}.
It assumes moderate familiarity with Ansible, including concepts such as playbooks, variables, and tags.
//Commenting out as no downstream alternative [AAP-57435]
//For more information about these and other Ansible concepts, see the link:https://docs.ansible.com/[Ansible documentation].
