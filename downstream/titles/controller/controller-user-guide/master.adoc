// Book Title
= Automation controller User Guide

Thank you for your interest in {PlatformName} {ControllerName}. 
{ControllerNameStart} helps teams manage complex multi-tier deployments by adding control, knowledge, and delegation to Ansible-powered environments.

The {ControllerNameStart} User Guide describes all of the functionality available in {ControllerName}. 
It assumes moderate familiarity with Ansible, including concepts such as Playbooks, Variables, and Tags. 
For more information on these and other Ansible concepts, see the Ansible documentation at http://docs.ansible.com/. 
This document has been updated to include information for the latest release of {ControllerName} v4.4.
