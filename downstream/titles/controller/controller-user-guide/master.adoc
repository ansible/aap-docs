// Book Title
= Automation Controller User Guide

Thank you for your interest in {PlatformName} {ControllerName}.
{ControllerNameStart} helps teams manage complex multi-tier deployments by adding control, knowledge, and delegation to Ansible-powered environments.

The {ControllerNameStart} User Guide describes all of the functionality available in {ControllerName}.
It assumes moderate familiarity with Ansible, including concepts such as Playbooks, Variables, and Tags.
For more information on these and other Ansible concepts, see the link:https://docs.ansible.com/[Ansible documentation].
