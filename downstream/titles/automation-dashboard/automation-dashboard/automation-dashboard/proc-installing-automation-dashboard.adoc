= Installing {AutomationDashboardName}

.Prerequisites

* One of the following tested configurations:
** RHEL 9 x86 or ARM based physical or virtual host. 
** Postgres v15 database. 
[IMPORTANT]
Do not attempt to install {AutomationDashboardName} on the same host(s) as {PlatformNameShort}.
* Access to _baseos_ and _{PlatformNameShort}stream_ repo packages for the RHEL 9 host.
* A non-root login account to the RHEL 9 host for installation. This requires passwordless sudo access to root as well. By default, we use the $HOMEDIR of the user account.
* URL details for access to your {PlatformNameShort} instances.
* An {PlatformNameShort} oauth2 token, which is used for communication between the {PlatformNameShort} instances and {AutomationDashboardName}.
* Access to download the installation bundle providing installation components for the {AutomationDashboardName}.
* Open firewall access to allow for communications. This includes HTTPS/443 from the {AutomationDashboardName} to the {PlatformNameShort} instance(s), but ports are configurable.
* Access to port 8447.
* A supported version of `ansible-core` installed on supported RHEL versions.
