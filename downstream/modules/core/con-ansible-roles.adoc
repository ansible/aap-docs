= About Ansible Roles

[role="_abstract"]

A role is Ansible's way of bundling automation content in addition to loading related vars, files, tasks, handlers, and other artifacts automatically by utilizing a known file structure. Instead of creating huge playbooks with hundreds of tasks, you can use roles to break the tasks apart into smaller, more discrete units of work.

You can find roles for provisioning infrastructure, deploying applications, and all of the tasks you do every day on {Galaxy}. Filter your search by *Type* and select *Role*. Once you find a role that you are interested in, you can download it by using the `ansible-galaxy` command that comes bundled with Ansible:

-----
$ ansible-galaxy role install username.rolename
