= Introduction

[role="_abstract"]

{Vault} lets you centrally store and manage secrets securely. The {PlatformNameShort} certified `hashicorp.vault` collection provides fully automated Key/Value V2 (KV2) secret lifecycle management for Vault. You can create, update, and delete secrets through playbooks.

* **Community-edition Vault users:** The `hashicorp.vault` solution is intended to replace unsupported `community.hashi_vault` collection. Use the migration path to keep your existing playbooks. For more information about migrating, see _Migrating from {VaultCommunityName}_.

* **New Vault users:** The `hashicorp.vault` collection is already included in the supported execution environment from Ansible automation hub.

[NOTE]
====
Although the `hashicorp.vault` and `hashi.terraform` collections work independently of each other and are designed for different tasks, you can use them together in advanced workflows.
