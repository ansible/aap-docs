= Configure the `hashicorp.vault.kv1_secret` module

.Procedure

* Configuring this module is not required for migration because there are no corresponding modules in `community.hashi_vault`. However, you might want to configure something other than the defaults for `auth_method` and `state` after the migration. You can use the examples on {HubNameMain} for reference.
