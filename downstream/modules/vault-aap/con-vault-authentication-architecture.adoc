= Authentication architecture

[role="_abstract"]

The `hashicorp.vault` collection manages authentication through environment variables and client initialization. This approach enhances security by preventing sensitive credentials from being passed directly as module parameters within playbook tasks. Instead, `hashicorp.vault` injects credentials into job templates with environment variables, so you get simpler, cleaner task definitions while ensuring that authentication details remain secure.

The following authentication types are supported:

* *Token authentication:* Set the `VAULT_TOKEN` environment variable.

Optionally, you can configure parameters for the token. If parameters are not provided, then the module uses env vars.
