You can drill down into cluster data to review more detailed information about successful or failed jobs.

The detailed view, presented on the *Job Explorer* page, provides information on the cluster, organization, template, and job type.
Filters you select on the *Clusters* view carry over to the *Job Explorer* page.

Details on those job templates will appear in the *Job Explorer* view, modified by any filters you select in the *Clusters* view.

For example, you can drill down to review details for failed jobs in a cluster.
