= Automation savings formulas

[role="_abstract"]
Automation savings is calculated by using the following formulas:

* **Manual cost per template** = (time for a manual run on one host * (sum of all hosts across job runs)) * cost per hour.
* **Automation cost per template** = cost of automation per hour * sum of total elapsed hours for a template.
* **Savings** = sum of (manual cost - automation costs) across all templates.
