= Creating a filtered and sorted view of jobs

[role="_abstract"]
You can view a list of jobs, filtered by attributes you choose, using the *Job Explorer*.

Filter options include:

* Status
* Job
* Cluster
* Organization
* Inventory
* Template

You can sort results by any of the parameters from each column by using the directional arrows.

.Procedure
. From the navigation panel, select {MenuAAJobExplorer}.
. In the filter toolbar, select *Job* from the *Filter by* list.
. In that same toolbar, select a time range. Job Explorer will now display jobs within that time range.
. To further refine results, return to the filter toolbar and select a different attribute to filter results by, including job status, cluster, or organization.
+
The *Job Explorer* view updates and presents a list of jobs based on the attributes you selected.
