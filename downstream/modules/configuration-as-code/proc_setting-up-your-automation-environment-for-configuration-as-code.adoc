= Setting up your automation environment for Configuration as Code

[role="_abstract"]
Configuration as Code is a way of working where you define and manage the configuration of the {PlatformNameShort} itself using the version-controlled configuration files (such as YAML, or JSON), instead of clicking through the web UI.

As an Ansible content developer, you can use the Configuration as Code approach to apply settings on your {ControllerName} to get the following benefits:

* Predictable job behavior
* Easier and faster scaling to new clusters
* Change history with diffs and rollback capability thanks to version control support
* Faster recovery after outages or migrations
* Reduced risk of errors because changes flow through CI/CD pipelines and pull requests, where peer reviews and automated testing are applied


.Prerequisites

* You have a Git account.
* Your {Gateway} instance is accessible.
* You built and registered your own {ExecEnvShort}. Alternatively, you have available the supported {ExecEnvShort} to run playbooks that use the `ansible.platform` collection. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.6/html/creating_and_using_execution_environments/index[Creating and using execution environments].


.Procedure

. Create a new Git repository.


. On your local machine, encrypt your password for {Gateway}:
+
[literal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ ansible-vault encrypt_string '_<gateway_password>_' --name 'aap_password'
New Vault password: _<vault_password>_
Confirm New Vault password: _<vault_password>_
Encryption successful
aap_password: !vault |
          $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
          63633763653530343566363864333130656433613634333465363733326261336465333362623635

----
+
You encrypted the value of the `aap_password` variable, which you will use in the next step.


. Create the `/my_ansible_project/vars/all.yml` file with variables for connecting to your {PlatformNameShort} and variables for creating Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) objects:
+
[literal,source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
---
# {PlatformNameShort} related variables

aap_username: "<GATEWAY_USER>"
aap_password: !vault |

aap_validate_certs: false

. Compose the `/my_ansible_project/RBAC_settings.yml` playbook, which creates RBAC objects and assigns roles to those objects:

....

Many values in this playbook are provided in the form of variables, such as object names, their details, {PlatformNameShort} credentials. You can easily reuse the variables throughout files in your Ansible project, which will also simplify the creation and maintenance of the project and reduce the number of errors.
+
Refer to the `all.yml` file to see the expanded values of those variables. For details about the module parameters, default values, and further examples how to use the modules, see the resources on {HubNameStart} for the link:https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/ansible/platform/content/?showing=module[ansible.platform] collection.


. Push the variables and the playbook to your Git repository so that the {ControllerName} can later read in the correct data.
+
[subs="+quotes",subs="attributes+"]
....
git add .
git commit -m "Provide variables and RBAC_settings.yml playbook resources for {PlatformNameShort} project"
git push origin _<relevant_branch_name>_
....


. Using the {Gateway} UI, create a new project with the following values:
+
* Name: Platform collection testing
* Description: Automation resources to test the CaC capability of RBAC modules from the `ansible.platform` collection
* Execution Environment: `ee-supported`
* Organization: Default
* Source Control Type: Git
* Source Control URL: +++https://my_git_url/my_git_repository/my_ansible_project+++
+
image::cac-create-project.png[Create project]


. Create a credential for your Ansible Vault password of your encrypted `aap_password` variable:
+
* Name: aap_password_vault
* Description: Holds vault password for decrypting the value of the `aap_password` variable
* Credential type: Vault
* Vault Password: _<vault_password>_
+
image::cac-create-vault-credential.png[Create Credential]


. Create a job template with the following values:
+
* Name: RBAC_settings
* Description: Create organization, team, user, and custom role RBAC objects. Assign a pre-existing role to the created team and assign a pre-existing role to the created user.
* Job type: Run
* Inventory: Demo Inventory
* Project: Platform collection testing
* Playbook: `RBAC_settings.yml`
* Execution Environment: `ee-supported`
* Credentials: aap_password_vault | Vault
+
image::cac-create-job-template.png[Create job template]


. Launch the `RBAC_settings` job template. After the template job successfully finishes, the output should be similar to the following:
+
[listing,options="nowrap"]
....

The output message shows that you ran the job template against 1 target (your localhost). At the same time, you created:
+
* An organization.
* A team that exists within the created organization. The team was assigned some pre-existing role.
* A user that exists within the created organization. The user was assigned some pre-existing role.
* A custom role.


.Verification

* In the navigation panel, check that you see your created organization:
+
image::cac-organization-exists.png[Organization exists]


* Check that you see your created team, which belongs to the organization and is assigned the correct pre-existing role:
+
image::cac-team-exists.png[Team with assigned role exists]


* Check that you see your created user, which belongs to the organization and is assigned the correct pre-existing role:
+
image::cac-user-exists.png[User with assigned role exists]


* Check that you see your created custom role, which was assigned the permissions as specified in your `RBAC_settings.yml` playbook:
+
image::cac-custom-role-exists.png[Custom role with assigned permissions exists]
