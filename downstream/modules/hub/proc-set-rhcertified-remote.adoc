= Configuring the rh-certified remote repository and synchronizing {CertifiedColl}

You can edit the *rh-certified* remote repository to synchronize collections from {HubName} hosted on {Console} to your {PrivateHubName}.
By default, your {PrivateHubName} `rh-certified` repository includes the URL for the entire group of {CertifiedName}.

To use only those collections specified by your organization, a {PrivateHubName} administrator can upload manually-created requirements files from the `rh-certified` remote.

For more information about using requirements files, see link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections_guide/collections_installing.html#install-multiple-collections-with-a-requirements-file[Install multiple collections with a requirements file] in the _Using Ansible collections_ guide.

If you have collections `A`, `B`, and `C` in your requirements file, and a new collection `X` is added to {Console} that you want to use, you must add `X` to your requirements file for {PrivateHubName} to synchronize it.


.Prerequisites

* You have valid *Modify Ansible repo content* permissions.
For more information on permissions, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/getting_started_with_automation_hub/assembly-user-access[Configuring user access for your {PrivateHubName}].
* You have retrieved the Sync URL and API Token from the {HubName} hosted service on {Console}.
* You have configured access to port 443. This is required for synchronizing certified collections. For more information, see the {HubName} table in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_planning_guide/ref-network-ports-protocols_planning[Network ports and protocols] chapter of the {PlatformName} Planning Guide.
