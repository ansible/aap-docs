= Configuring the rh-certified remote repository to sync {CertifiedName}

You can edit the *rh-certified* remote repository to synchronize collections from {HubName} hosted on {Console} to your {PrivateHubName}.
By default, your {PrivateHubName} `rh-certified` repository includes the URL for the entire group of {CertifiedName}.

To use only those collections specified by your organization, a {PrivateHubName} administrator can upload manually-created requirements files from the `rh-certified` remote.

If you have collections `A`, `B`, and `C` in your requirements file, and a new collection `X` is added to {Console} that you want to use, you must add `X` to your requirements file for {PrivateHubName} to synchronize it.

.Prerequisites

* You have valid *Modify Ansible repo content* permissions.
For more information on permissions, see link:{LinkCentralAuth}.
* You have retrieved the Sync URL and API Token from the {HubName} hosted service on {Console}.
* You have configured access to port 443. This is required for synchronizing certified collections. For more information, see the {HubName} table in the link:{URLPlanningGuide}/ref-network-ports-protocols_planning[Network ports and protocols] chapter of {TitlePlanningGuide}.

.Procedure

. Log in to your {PlatformNameShort}.
. From the navigation panel, select {MenuACAdminRemotes}.
. In the *rh-certified* remote repository, click btn:[Edit remote].
. In the *URL* field, paste the *Sync URL*.
. In the *Token* field, paste the token you acquired from {Console}.
. Click btn:[Save remote].

You can now synchronize collections from {Console} to your {PrivateHubName}. See link:{URLHubManagingContent}/managing-cert-valid-content#assembly-synclists[Synchronizing Ansible content collections in {HubName}] for syncing steps.
