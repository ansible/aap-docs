= Creating a requirements file

[role="_abstract"]
Use a requirements file to add collections to your {HubName}. Requirements files are in YAML format and list the collections that you want to install in your {HubName}. 

A standard `requirements.yml` file contains the following parameters:

* `name`: the name of the collection formatted as `<namespace>.<collection_name>`
* `version`: the collection version number

.Procedure

* Create your requirements file.
+
In YAML format, collection information in your requirements file should contain the following information:
+
[source,bash]
----
collections:
  - name: namespace.collection_name
    version: 1.0.0
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Be sure to specify the collection version number, otherwise you will sync all collection versions. Syncing all versions can require more space than expected.
