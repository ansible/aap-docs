= Using content signing services in {PrivateHubName}

After you have configured content signing on your {PrivateHubName}, you can manually sign a new collection or replace an existing signature with a new one.
When users download a specific collection, this signature indicates that the collection is for them and has not been modified after certification.

You can use content signing on {PrivateHubName} in the following scenarios:

* Your system does not have automatic signing configured and you must use a manual signing process to sign collections.
* The current signatures on the automatically configured collections are corrupted and need new signatures.
* You need additional signatures for previously signed content.
* You want to rotate signatures on your collections.

.Procedure

. Log in to your {PlatformNameShort}.
include::snippets/snip_menu-top-ac.adoc[]
*{MenuACAdminCollectionApproval}*.
The Approval dashboard opens and displays a list of collections.

. Click btn:[Sign and approve] for each collection that you want to sign.

.Verification
* Verify that the collections you signed and manually approved are displayed in the *Collections* tab.
