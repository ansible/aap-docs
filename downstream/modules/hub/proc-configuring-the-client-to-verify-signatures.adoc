= Configuring the client to verify signatures

In order to ensure a container image pulled from the remote registry is properly signed, you must first configure the image with the proper public key in a policy file. 

.Prerequisites
* The client must have sudo privileges configured to verify signatures.

.Procedure

. Open your terminal and use the following command: 
+
----
>  sudo <name of editor> __/etc/containers/policy.json
----
+
The file that is displayed is similar to this:
+
----
    {
        "default": [{"type": "reject"}],
        "transports": {
            "docker": {
              "quay.io": [{"type": "insecureAcceptAnything}],
              "docker.io": [{"type": "insecureAcceptAnything}],
              "_<server-address>_": [
                {
                    "type": "signedBy",
                    "keyType": "GPGKeys",
                    "keyPath": "/tmp/containersig.txt"
    }
----
+
This file shows that neither `quay.io`, or `docker.io` will perform the verification, because the type is `insecureAcceptAnything` which overrides the default type of `reject`. However, `_<server-address>_` will perform the verification, because the parameter `type` is set to `"signedBy"`.
+
[NOTE]
====
The only `keyType`` currently supported is GPG keys.
====
+
. Under the `_<server-address>_` entry, modify the `keyPath` <1> to include the
name of your key file.

    {
        "default": [{"type": "reject"}],
        "transports": {
            "docker": {
              "quay.io": [{"type": "insecureAcceptAnything}],
              "docker.io": [{"type": "insecureAcceptAnything}],
              "_<server-address>_1": [
                {
                    "type": "signedBy",
                    "keyType": "GPGKeys",
                    "keyPath": "/tmp/<key file name", <1>
                    "signedIdentity": {
                      "type": "remapIdentity",
                      "prefix": "_<server-address>_",
                      "signedPrefix": "0.0.0.0:8002"
    }
----
+
. Save and close the file.

.Verification
* Pull the file using Podman, or your client of choice:

----
> podman pull _<server-address>_/<container-name>:<tag name>
--tls-verify=false
----

This response verifies the image has been signed with no errors. If the image is not signed, the command will fail.
