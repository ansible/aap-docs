= Deploying your system for container signing

{HubNameStart} implements image signing so you can rely on better security for the {ExecEnvShort} container images.

As an {PlatformNameShort} user, you confirm if an {ExecEnvShort} or container is already signed, or how to use the proper tools to sign and verify the signature yourself. 
Complete the following steps to deploy your system so it is ready for container signing.


.Procedure
. Deploy your system with support for container signing activated.

    _automation_hub:
        automationhub_create_default_container_signing_service: true
        automationhub_container_signing_service_key: _path/to/gpg.key_
        automationhub_container_signing_service_script: _path/to/executable_


. Navigate to {HubName}.

. From the navigation panel, select menu:Signature Keys[].

. Ensure you have a key titled *container-default*, or *container*-_anyname_.

[NOTE]
==== 
The `container-default` service is created by the {PlatformNameShort} installer.
