= Explanation of Red Hat {CertifiedName} synclists

A synclist is a curated group of Red Hat Certified Collections that is assembled by your organization administrator.
It synchronizes with your local {HubNameMain}. 
Use synclists to manage only the content that you want and exclude unnecessary collections.
Design and manage your synclist from the content available as part of Red Hat content on {Console}

Each synclist has its own unique repository URL that you can use to designate as a remote source for content in {HubName}.
You securely access each synclist by using an API token.
