= Configuring the community remote repository and syncing {Galaxy} collections

You can edit the *community* remote repository to synchronize chosen collections from {Galaxy} to your {PrivateHubName}.
By default, your {PrivateHubName} community repository directs to `galaxy.ansible.com/api/`.

.Prerequisites

* You have *Modify Ansible repo content* permissions.

* You have a `requirements.yml` file that identifies those collections to synchronize from {Galaxy} as in the following example:
+

  # Install a collection from Ansible Galaxy.
  - name: community.aws
    version: 5.2.0
