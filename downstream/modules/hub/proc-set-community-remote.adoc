= Configure proxy settings for {PrivateHubName} community remote

[role="_abstract"]
If your {PrivateHubName} is behind a network proxy, you can configure proxy settings on the remote to sync content located outside of your local network.

You can edit the *community* remote repository to synchronize chosen collections from {Galaxy} to your {PrivateHubName}.
By default, your {PrivateHubName} community repository directs to `galaxy.ansible.com/api/`.

.Prerequisites

* You have *Modify Ansible repo content* permissions.
For more information on permissions, see {LinkCentralAuth}.
* You have a `requirements.yml` file that identifies those collections to synchronize from {Galaxy} as in the following example:
+
*Requirements.yml example*
-----
collections:
  # Install a collection from Ansible Galaxy.
  - name: community.aws
    version: 5.2.0
    source: https://galaxy.ansible.com
-----

.Procedure

. Log in to {PlatformNameShort}.
. From the navigation panel, select {MenuACAdminRemotes}.
. In the *Details* tab in the *Community* remote, click btn:[Edit remote].
. In the *YAML requirements* field, paste the contents of your `requirements.yml` file.
. Click btn:[Save remote].

.Result
You can now synchronize collections identified in your `requirements.yml` file from {Galaxy} to your {PrivateHubName}.
