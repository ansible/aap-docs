= Syncing Ansible content collections

You can sync certified and validated collections in {HubNameMain} on {Console}.
//[ddacosta]This needs to be checked. I don't see a Repositories selection in the console verion. I think the way I've rewritten is correct.
// [hherbly] Looks like there is no synclist info in console or the test instance; commenting out this info for 2.5
// Your synclist repository is located on the {HubName} navigation panel under {MenuACAdminRepositories}, which is updated whenever you manage content within {CertifiedName}.

//All {CertifiedName} are included by default in your initial organization synclist.

[NOTE]
====
When syncing content, keep in mind that {HubName} does not check other repositories for dependencies. To avoid an error, turn off dependency downloading by editing your remote settings. See link:{URLHubManagingContent}/managing-collections-hub#proc-create-remote_remote-management[Creating a remote configuration in {HubName}] for more information.
