= Creating a namespace

[role="_abstract"]
You can create a namespace to organize collections that your content developers upload to {HubName}.
When creating a namespace, you can assign a team in {HubName} as owners of that namespace.

[TIP]

====

By default, namespaces used on {Galaxy} are also used on {HubName} by the Ansible partner team. 
For questions, contact ansiblepartners@redhat.com.
