= Installing {HubName} for development

Use the playbook `install_devel` to install an all-in-one {HubName} for development.

[NOTE]
====

If you do not set the `hub_admin_password` parameter, the installer sets one and prints it as part of its output.

====

.Procedure

. Run the installation playbook using the following command:

----
ansible-playbook -i </path/to/inventory> ansible.private_partner_automation_hub_installer.install_devel
----

[NOTE]
====

The development option installs automation hub and the database on the same host, so there is no need to assign the host to a group in the inventory file.
