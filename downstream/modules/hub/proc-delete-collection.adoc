= Deleting a collection on {HubName}

You can further manage your collections by deleting unwanted collections, if the collection is not dependent on other collections. The *Dependencies* tab on a collection displays a list of other collections that use the current collection.

.Prerequisites
* The collection being deleted does not have dependencies with other collections.
* You have *Delete Collections* permissions.

.Procedure

. Log in to your {PlatformNameShort}.
. From the navigation panel, select {MenuACCollections}.
. Before deleting the collection, check to see if it has collections that are dependent on it:
** Click the *Dependencies* tab for that collection. If it is blank, you will be able to delete the collection. If the *Dependencies* tab is not blank, you must delete these dependencies before you can delete the collection.
. Click the collection to delete.
. Click the btn:[More Actions] icon *{MoreActionsIcon}*, and then select an option:
.. *Delete version from system* removes the specific version of the collection from the entire instance, including all repositories and namespaces.
.. *Delete version from repository* removes the specific version of the collection from the repository where it was uploaded. This does not affect the collection in other repositories or namespaces.
.. *Delete entire collection from repository* removes all versions of the entire collection from the repository where it was uploaded, but does not affect other repositories or namespaces.
.. *Delete entire collection from system* removes all versions of the entire collection from the instance, including all repositories and namespaces.
. When the confirmation window opens, verify that the collection or version number is correct, and then select *Delete*.
