[id="token-management-hub_{context}"]
= Token management in {HubName}

Before you can interact with {HubName} by uploading or downloading collections, you must create an API token. The {HubName} API token authenticates your `ansible-galaxy` client to the Red Hat {HubName} server.

[NOTE]
====
{HubNameStart} does not support basic authentication or authenticating through service accounts. You must authenticate using token management.
====

Your method for creating the API token differs according to the type of {HubName} that you are using:

* {HubNameStart} uses offline token management. See xref:proc-create-api-token_cloud-sync[Creating the offline token in {HubName}].

* {PrivateHubNameStart} uses API token management. See xref:proc-create-api-token-pah_cloud-sync[Creating the API token in {PrivateHubName}].

* If you are using Keycloak to authenticate your {PrivateHubName}, follow the procedure for xref:proc-create-api-token_cloud-sync[Creating the offline token in {HubName}].
