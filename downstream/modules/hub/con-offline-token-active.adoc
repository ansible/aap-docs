= Keeping your offline token active

Offline tokens expire after 30 days of inactivity. You can keep your offline token from expiring by periodically refreshing your offline token.

Keeping an online token active is useful when an application performs an action on behalf of the user; for example, this allows the application to perform a routine data backup when the user is offline.

[NOTE]
====
If your offline token expires, you must request a new one.
