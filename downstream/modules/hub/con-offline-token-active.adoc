= Keeping your offline token active

Offline tokens expire after 30 days of inactivity. You can keep your offline token from expiring by periodically refreshing your offline token.

Keeping an offline token active is useful when an application performs an action on behalf of the user; when the user is offline, such as a routine data backup.

[NOTE]
====
If your offline token expires, you must request a new one.
