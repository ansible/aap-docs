= Container registries

[role="_abstract"]

The {HubName} remote registry is used for storing and managing {ExecEnvName}.
When you have built or sourced an {ExecEnvShort}, you can push that {ExecEnvShort} to the registry portion of {PrivateHubName} to create a container repository.

Then, you can:

* Push an {ExecEnvShort} to the {HubName} remote registry.
* Create a group with access to the container repository in the registry.
* Add the new group to the container repository.
* Add a README to the container repository to provide users with information and relevant links.
