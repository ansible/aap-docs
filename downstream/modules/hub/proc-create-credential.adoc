= Creating a credential

To pull {ExecEnvName} images from a password or token-protected registry, you must create a credential.

In earlier versions of {PlatformNameShort}, you were required to deploy a registry to store {ExecEnvShort} images.
On {PlatformNameShort} 2.0 and later, the system operates as if you already have a remote registry up and running.
To store {ExecEnvShort} images, add the credentials of only your selected remote registries.
