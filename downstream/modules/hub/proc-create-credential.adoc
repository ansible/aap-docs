= Create a credential

[role="_abstract"]
To pull {ExecEnvName} images from a password or token-protected registry, you must create a credential.

In earlier versions of {PlatformNameShort}, you were required to deploy a registry to store {ExecEnvShort} images.
On {PlatformNameShort} 2.0 and later, the system operates as if you already have a remote registry up and running.
To store {ExecEnvShort} images, add the credentials of only your selected remote registries.

.Procedure

. Log in to {PlatformNameShort}.
. From the navigation panel, select {MenuAECredentials}.
. Click btn:[Create credential] to create a new credential.
. Enter an authorization *Name*, *Description*, and *Organization*.
. In the *Credential Type* drop-down, select *Container Registry*. 
. Enter the *Authentication URL*. This is the remote registry address.
. Enter the *Username* and *Password or Token* required to log in to the remote registry.
. Optional: To enable SSL verification, select *Verify SSL*.
. Click btn:[Create credential].
