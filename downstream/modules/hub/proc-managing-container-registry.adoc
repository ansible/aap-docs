= Managing your {PrivateHubName} remote registry


[role="_abstract"]
You do not build container images directly inside {PrivateHubName}. Instead, use the following workflow to populate and manage your registry:

. Pull an {ExecEnvShort} from an external registry (like registry.redhat.io) to your local machine.

. Tag the image locally for your {PrivateHubName} registry.

. Push the image to your {PrivateHubName}.

. Configure access permissions and documentation (such as READMEs) within {PrivateHubName} so your teams can use the image.
