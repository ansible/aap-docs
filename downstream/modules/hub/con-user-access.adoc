= Implementing user access

User access is based on managing permissions to system objects (users, groups, namespaces) rather than by assigning permissions individually to specific users.

You assign permissions to the groups that you create. You can then assign users to these groups. This means that each user in a group has the permissions assigned to that group.

Groups created in {HubName} can range from system administrators responsible for governing internal collections, configuring user access, and repository management to groups with access to organize and upload internally developed content to {HubName}.

* See xref:ref-permissions[Automation Hub permissions] for information on system permissions.

== Default user access for {HubName}

When you install {HubName}, the system automatically creates the default *admin* user in the *Admin* group. The *Admin* group is assigned all permissions in the system.
