= Uploading collections to your namespaces

You can upload internally developed collections in `tar.gz` file format to your {PrivateHubName} namespace for review and approval by an {HubName} administrator.
When approved, the collection moves to the *Published* content repository where {HubName} users can view and download it.

[NOTE]
====
Format your collection file name as follows: <my_namespace-my_collection-1.0.0.tar.gz>
====

.Prerequisites
* You have a namespace to which you can upload the collection.

[IMPORTANT]

====
{PlatformNameShort} does not support uploading collections larger than 2GB. Doing so will result in an error. In scenarios that require a complete environment with multiple collections and dependencies, use an {ExecEnvShort}. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.6/html/managing_automation_content/managing-containers-hub#obtain-images[Pulling {ExecEnvShort}s for use in {HubName}] for more information.
====

.Verification
To verify whether the collection uploaded successfully or if it failed, navigate to {MenuACNamespaces} and click the btn:[More Actions] icon *{MoreActionsIcon}*, then select *Imports*. There you will find a summary of tests indicating whether the import was successful.
