= Remote registry team permissions

[role="_abstract"]

Create and assign permissions to a team in {PrivateHubName} to allow users to access specific features in the system.
New teams do not have any assigned permissions by default. You must add permissions when first creating a team or edit an existing team to add or remove permissions. 

For more on managing access through teams, see link:{URLCentralAuth}/gw-managing-access#assembly-controller-teams_gw-manage-rbac[Teams] in the {TitleCentralAuth} guide.

The following table lists permissions you can grant to teams to ensure they have the correct level of access and privileges to your remote registries.
