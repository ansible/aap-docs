= Pushing an {ExecEnvShort} to {PrivateHubName}


[role="_abstract"]
You can push tagged {ExecEnvShort}s to {PrivateHubName} to create new containers and populate the remote registry.

.Prerequisites

* You have permissions to create new containers.
* You have the FQDN or IP address of the {PlatformNameShort} instance.

.Procedure

. Log in to Podman using your {PlatformNameShort} location and credentials:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
-----
$ podman login -u=__<username>__ -p=__<password>__ __<aap_url>__
-----
+
[WARNING]
====
Let Podman prompt you for your password when you log in. Entering your password at the same time as your username can expose your password to the shell history.
====
+
. Push your {ExecEnvShort} to your {HubName} remote registry:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
-----
$ podman push __<automation_hub_url>__/__<ee_name>__
-----

.Troubleshooting

The `push` operation re-compresses image layers during the upload, which is not guaranteed to be reproducible and is client-implementation dependent.
This may lead to image-layer digest changes and a failed push operation, resulting in `Error: Copying this image requires changing layer representation, which is not possible (image is signed or the destination specifies a digest)`.

.Verification

. Log in to your {PlatformNameShort}.

. Navigate to {MenuACExecEnvironments}.

. Locate the container in the container repository list.
