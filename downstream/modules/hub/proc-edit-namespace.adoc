= Adding additional information and resources to a namespace

You can add information and provide resources for your users to accompany collections included in the namespace. For example, you can add a logo and a description, and link users to your GitHub repository, issue tracker, or other online assets. You can also enter markdown text in the *Resources* field to include more information. This is helpful to users who use your collection in their automation tasks.

.Prerequisites

* You have *Change Namespaces* permissions.

.Procedure

. Log in to {PlatformNameShort}.
. From the navigation panel, select {MenuACNamespaces}.
. Select the namespace you want to edit.
. Click the btn:[Edit namespace].
. Enter the relevant information in the fields.
. Optional: enter markdown information in the *Resources* field.
. Click btn:[Save namespace].

Your content developers can now upload collections to your new namespace, or allow users in teams assigned as owners to upload collections.
