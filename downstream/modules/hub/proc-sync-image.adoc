= Syncing images from a container repository

You can pull images from the {HubName} container registry to sync an image to your local machine.
To sync an image from a remote container registry, you must first configure a remote registry.

.Prerequisites

You must have permission to view and pull from a private container repository.

.Procedure

. From the navigation panel, select {MenuACExecEnvironments}.

. Add https://registry.redhat.io to the registry.

. Add any required credentials to authenticate.
+
[NOTE]
====
Some container registries are aggressive with rate limiting.
Set a rate limit under *Advanced Options*.
====
+
. From the navigation panel, select {MenuACExecEnvironments}.

. Click btn:[Add execution environment] in the page header.

. Select the registry you want to pull from.
The *Name* field displays the name of the image displayed on your local registry.
+
[NOTE]
====
The *Upstream name* field is the name of the image on the remote server.
For example, if the upstream name is set to "alpine" and the *Name* field is "local/alpine", the alpine image is downloaded from the remote and renamed to "local/alpine".
====
+
. Set a list of tags to include or exclude.
Syncing images with a large number of tags is time consuming and uses a lot of disk space.
