= Revert to a different {HubName} repository version

When automation content collections are added or removed from a repository, a new version is created. If a change to your repository causes a problem, you can revert to a previous version. Reverting is a safe operation and does not delete collections from the system, but rather, changes the content associated with the repository. The number of versions saved is defined in the *Retained number of versions* setting when a xref:proc-create-repository[repository is created].
