= {PlatformNameShort} account planning

{PlatformNameShort} user accounts for accessing the user interface or API can either be local (stored in the {PlatformNameShort} database) or mapped to an external authentication source, such as a _Lightweight Directory Access Protocol_ (LDAP) server. 
This guide recommends that where possible, all primary user accounts should be mapped to an external authentication source. 
Using external account sources eliminates a source of error when working with permissions in this context and minimizes the amount of time devoted to maintaining a full set of users exclusively within {PlatformNameShort}. 
This includes accounts assigned to individual persons as well as for non-person entities, such as service accounts used for external application integration. 
Reserve any local accounts, such as the default “admin” account, for emergency access or “break glass” scenarios where the external authentication mechanism isn't available.

* Google OAuth

Choose an authentication mechanism that adheres to your organization's authentication policies and refer to {LinkCentralAuth} to understand the prerequisites for the relevant authentication mechanism. 
The authentication mechanism used must ensure that the authentication-related traffic between {PlatformNameShort} and the authentication back-end is encrypted when the traffic occurs on a public or non-secure network (for example, LDAPS or LDAP over TLS, HTTPS for OAuth2 and SAML providers, etc.).

In the {PlatformNameShort} UI, any “system administrator” account can edit, change, and update any inventory or automation definition. Restrict these account privileges to the minimum set of users possible for low-level automation controller configuration and disaster recovery.

[NOTE]
====
{platformNameShort} {PlatformVers} introduces a new central authentication mechanism used by all of the platform components: 

* {ControllerNameStart}
* {PrivateHubNameStart}
* {EDAcontroller} 

Before {PlatformVers}, each of these components had their own authentication configuration.
