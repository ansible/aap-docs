= Fapolicyd on managed RHEL nodes

When an {PlatformNameShort} job runs against a RHEL managed node, most tasks are executed by copying Python code to the managed node and then executing it locally. 
The job will fail if the `fapolicyd` service is enabled on the managed node, because the default set of rules that come with RHEL prevents this Python code from running. 

To prevent this issue from occurring, use one of the following methods:

* Option 1: Set the fapolicyd service to permissive mode
* Option 2: Create custom fapolicyd rules
