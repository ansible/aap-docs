= Disaster recovery and continuity of operations

[role="_abstract"]

Taking regular backups of {PlatformNameShort} is a critical part of disaster recovery planning. Both backups and restores are performed using the {Installer}, so these actions should be performed from the dedicated installation host. Refer to link:{URLControllerAdminGuide}/controller-backup-and-restore[Back up and restore] for further details on how to perform these operations.

An important aspect of backups is that they contain a copy of the database as well as the secret key used to decrypt credentials stored in the database, so the backup files should be stored in a secure encrypted location.  Otherwise, credentials stored in the backup file may be at risk of being disclosed. Access to backups should be limited only to {PlatformNameShort} administrators who have root shell access to the infrastructure nodes and the dedicated installation host.

The two main reasons an {PlatformNameShort} administrator needs to back up their {PlatformNameShort} environment are:

* To save a copy of the data from your {PlatformNameShort} environment, so you can restore it if needed.
* To use the backup to restore the environment into a different set of servers if you're creating a new {PlatformNameShort} cluster or preparing for an upgrade.

In all cases, the recommended and safest process is to always use the same versions of PostgreSQL and {PlatformNameShort} to back up and restore the environment.
