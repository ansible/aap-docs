= Securing sensitive variables with ansible vault

The installation inventory file for {PlatformNameShort} contains a number of sensitive variables, such as default administrative and database passwords. 
By default, these are stored in plain text. 
By securing sensitive values with Ansible Vault, both RPM-based and containerized {PlatformNameShort} installations benefit from improved security, password hygiene, and maintainability. 

To create an Ansible vault file, use the following procedure: 

.Procedure

. Navigate to the install directory by using the following command:
+
`cd /path/to/ansible-automation-platform-setup-bundle-2.5-<version>`
. Create a vault file by using the following command:
+
`ansible-vault create vault.yml`
. When prompted, enter a vault password
This password is required to access or modify the vault and is required for day-two operations such as backups and reconfigurations. 
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Passwords with special characters must be in double quotes.
====
. Store the vault password securely, in accordance with your organizations security policy, for example, using a password manager or vault service.
. Add your sensitive variables to the vault and ensure they are not also defined in the inventory file.

To edit your vault file use:

`ansible-vault edit <file>`
