= Install an RPM-based {PlatformNameShort} deployment using an external vault file

To use the new Ansible vault with the {Installer}, run it with the command 

`./setup.sh -e @vault.yml -- --ask-vault-pass`.

This instructs the installer to load encrypted variables from the specified Ansible vault file and prompts the user for the vault password at runtime.
