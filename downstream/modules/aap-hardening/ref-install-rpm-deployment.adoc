= Using an external vault file with an RPM-based {PlatformNameShort} deployment

For RPM-based installations, you can provide the Ansible Vault at runtime when executing the setup script.

Sensitive variables used are as follows:

----
admin_password: <secure_password>
pg_password: <secure_password>
automationgateway_admin_password: <secure_password>
automationgateway_pg_password: <secure_password>
automationhub_admin_password: <secure_password>
automationhub_pg_password: <secure_password>
automationedacontroller_admin_password: <secure_password>
automationedacontroller_pg_password: <secure_password>
----
To use the new Ansible vault with the {Installer}, ensure the file, for example, `vault.yml`, contains all required sensitive variables and run it with the following command: 

`./setup.sh -e @vault.yml â€“ask-vault-pass`

Ensure that the vault file is located in the working directory, or provide the full path. Do not duplicate the encrypted variables in the plaintext inventory file.

This ensures that the installer reads encrypted variables from the vault and prompts for the vault password.
