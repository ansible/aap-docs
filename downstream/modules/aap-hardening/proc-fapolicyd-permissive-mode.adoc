= Option 1: Set the fapolicyd service to permissive mode

The fapolicyd service can be set to "permissive" mode, meaning that it only logs fapolicyd rule violations, rather than enforcing them. 

To configure permissive mode for fapolicyd, use the following procedure: 

.Procedure
. Edit the file `/etc/fapolicyd/fapolicyd.conf`, and set "permissive = 1".  
. Restart the `fapolicy` service by running `systemctl restart fapolicyd.service`.

In environments where this configuration might not meet a required compliance profile or local policy, discuss waiving the relevant security control with your security auditor.
