= Patch automation with {PlatformNameShort}

[role="_abstract"]

Software patching is a fundamental activity of security and IT operations teams everywhere.
Keeping patches up to date is critical to remediating software vulnerabilities and meeting compliance requirements, but patching systems manually at scale can be time-consuming and error-prone.
Organizations should put thought into patch management strategies that meet their security, compliance, and business objectives, in order to prioritize the types of patches to apply (known exploits, critical or important vulnerabilities, optimizations, routine updates, new features, and so on) against the IT assets available across the enterprise.

Once you have defined policies and priorities and established a patching plan, you can automate the manual patch management tasks using the {PlatformNameShort}.
Automating the tasks improves patch deployment speed and accuracy, reduces human error, and limits downtime.
