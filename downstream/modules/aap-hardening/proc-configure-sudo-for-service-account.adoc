[id="proc-configure-sudo-for-service-account"]

= Configure sudo privileges for service account 

The service account requires sufficient privileges to run any current or future automation job on the managed node. This section describes the use of `sudo`, though other privilege escalation methods are available.

Since {PlatformNameShort} defaults to using the `ansible.builtin.sudo` link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/become.html[become plugin] on Linux-based managed nodes, the service account must be permitted to run any command on the RHEL managed node using the sudo command. 

.Procedure
. Create the file `/etc/sudoers.d/ansible`, and include the following content:
+
----
# Rules for the ansible service account
ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
----
. Set restrictive permissions on the file:
+
`sudo chmod 600 /etc/sudoers.d/ansible``

. Verify the file uses the proper syntax:
+
`sudo visudo -cf /etc/sudoers.d/ansible`
