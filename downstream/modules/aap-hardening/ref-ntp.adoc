= NTP

[role="_abstract"]

Configure each server in the {PlatformNameShort} infrastructure to synchronize time with an NTP pool or your organization's NTP service. This ensures that logging and auditing events generated by {PlatformNameShort} have an accurate time stamp, and that any scheduled jobs running from the {ControllerName} execute at the correct time.

For information on configuring the chrony service for NTP synchronization, see link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/configuring_basic_system_settings/configuring-time-synchronization_configuring-basic-system-settings#using-chrony_configuring-time-synchronization[Using Chrony] in the {RHEL} documentation.
