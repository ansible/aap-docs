[role="_abstract"]

Configure each server in the {PlatformNameShort} (AAP) infrastructure to synchronize time with an NTP pool or your organization's NTP service. This ensures that logging and auditing events generated by AAP have an accurate time stamp, and that any scheduled jobs running from the {ControllerName} execute at the correct time.

For information on configuring the chrony service for NTP synchronization, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/configuring_basic_system_settings/using-chrony_configuring-basic-system-settings#doc-wrapper[Using Chrony] in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux documentation.
