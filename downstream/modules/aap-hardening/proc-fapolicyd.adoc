= Fapolicyd

[role="_abstract"]

A compliance policy might requires the fapolicyd daemon to be running. 
However, {PlatformNameShort} is not currently supported when fapolicyd enforcing policy, as this causes failures during both installation and operation of {PlatformNameShort}. 
Because of this, the installer runs a pre-flight check that halts installation if it discovers that fapolicyd is enforcing policy. 
This guide recommends setting fapolicyd to permissive mode on {PlatformNameShort} using the following steps:

. Edit the file `/etc/fapolicyd/fapolicyd.conf` and set "permissive = 1".
. Restart the service with the command 
+
`sudo systemctl restart fapolicyd.service`.


[NOTE]
====
If this security control is also applied to the installation host, the default `fapolicyd` configuration causes the {PlatformNameShort} installer to fail. In this case, the recommendation is to set fapolicyd to permissive mode on the installation host.
