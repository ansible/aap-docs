= Fapolicyd

[role="_abstract"]

A compliance policy might require the `fapolicyd` daemon to be running. 
However, {PlatformNameShort} is not currently supported when `fapolicyd` is enforcing policy, as this causes failures during both installation and operation of {PlatformNameShort}. 
Because of this, the installation program runs a pre-flight check that halts installation if it discovers that `fapolicyd` is enforcing policy. 
This guide recommends setting `fapolicyd` to permissive mode on {PlatformNameShort} using the following steps:

.Procedure
. Edit the file `/etc/fapolicyd/fapolicyd.conf` and set "permissive = 1".
. Restart the service with the command 
+
`sudo systemctl restart fapolicyd.service`
+

[NOTE]
====
If this security control is also applied to the installation host, the default `fapolicyd` configuration causes the {PlatformNameShort} installation program to fail. In this case, the recommendation is to set `fapolicyd` to permissive mode on the installation host.
