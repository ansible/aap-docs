= Using an external vault file with an RPM-based {PlatformNameShort} deployment

For RPM-based installations, you can provide the Ansible vault at runtime when executing the setup script.

Add the following sensitive variables to the vault file:

----
admin_password: <secure_password>
pg_password: <secure_password>
automationgateway_admin_password: <secure_password>
automationgateway_pg_password: <secure_password>
automationhub_admin_password: <secure_password>
automationhub_pg_password: <secure_password>
automationedacontroller_admin_password: <secure_password>
automationedacontroller_pg_password: <secure_password>

*In the case of a connected installation:

registry_password: <secure_cdn_password>
----

To use the vault during installation, use the following procedure:

.Procedure

. Ensure the vault file, for example, `vault.yml`, contains all required sensitive variables.
. Run the installation using the following command: 
+
`./setup.sh -e @vault.yml â€“ask-vault-pass`

Using this procedure ensures that the installer reads encrypted variables from the vault and prompts for the vault password.
