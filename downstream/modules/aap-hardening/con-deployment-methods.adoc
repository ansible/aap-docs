= {PlatformName} deployment methods

[role="_abstract"]
There are three different installation methods for {PlatformNameShort}: 

* RPM-based on {RHEL}
* Container-based on {RHEL}
* Operator-based on {OCP}  

Guidance is provided for hardening {PlatformNameShort} when using RPM-based or container-based installation.  

Using the container-based installation method for new deployments is recommended, as the RPM-based {Installer} has been deprecated. 

Hardening guidance for operator-based deployments is not provided.
