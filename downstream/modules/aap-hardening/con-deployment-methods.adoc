= {PlatformName} deployment methods

There are three different installation methods for {PlatformNameShort}: 

* RPM-based on {RHEL}
* Container-based on {RHEL}
* Operator-based on {OCP}  

This document offers guidance on hardening {PlatformNameShort} when installed using either of the first two installation methods (RPM-based or container-based).  
This document further recommends using the container-based installation method for new deployments, as the RPM-based installer will be deprecated in a future release. 

For further information, see link:{URLReleaseNotes}/aap-2.5-deprecated-features#aap-2.5-deprecated-features[Deprecated features].

Operator-based deployments are out of scope for this document.
