= {PlatformNameStart} deployment methods

There are three different installation methods for {PlatformNameShort}: 

* RPM-based on {RHEL}
* Container-based on {RHEL}
* Operator-based on {OCP}  

This document offers guidance on hardening {PlatformNameShort} when installed using either of the first two installation methods (RPM-based or container-based).  
This document further recommends using the container-based installation method for new deployments, as the RPM-based installer is deprecated in the 2.5 release. 
Operator-based deployments are out of scope for this document.
