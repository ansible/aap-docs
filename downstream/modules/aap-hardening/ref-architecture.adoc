= {PlatformNameShort} deployment topologies

[role="_abstract"]

Install {PlatformNameShort} {PlaformVers} based on one of the documented tested deployment topologies defined in link:{LinkTopologies}. 
Enterprise organizations should use one of the enterprise topologies for production deployments to ensure the highest level of uptime, performance, and continued scalability. 
Organizations or deployments that are resource constrained can use a "growth" topology.
Review the Tested deployment models document to determine the topology that best suits your requirements. 
The topology chosen will include planning information such as a topology diagram, the number of {RHEL} servers required, the network ports and protocols used by the deployment, and load balancer information for enterprise topologies.

It is possible to install the {PlatformNameShort} on different infrastructure topologies and with different environment configurations. 
Red Hat does not fully test topologies outside of published deployment models.

The following diagram is a tested container enterprise topology:

//{EDAName} is a new feature of {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers} that was not available when the reference architecture detailed in Figure 1: Reference architecture overview was originally written. Currently, the supported configuration is a single {ControllerName}, single {HubName}, and single {EDAController} node with external (installer managed) database. For an organization interested in {EDAName}, the recommendation is to install according to the configuration documented in the link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_installation_guide/assembly-platform-install-scenario#ref-single-controller-hub-eda-with-managed-db[{PlatformNameShort} Installation Guide]. This document provides additional clarifications when {EDAName} specific hardening configuration is required.

//For smaller production deployments where the full reference architecture may not be needed, this guide recommends deploying {PlatformNameShort} with a dedicated PostgreSQL database server whether managed by the installer or provided externally.
