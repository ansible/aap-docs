= {PlatformNameShort} reference architecture

[role="_abstract"]

For large-scale production environments with availability requirements, this guide recommends deploying the components described in section 2.1 of this guide using the instructions in the xref:ref-architecture_{context}[reference architecture] documentation for {PlatformName} on {RHEL}. While some variation may make sense for your specific technical requirements, following the reference architecture results in a supported production-ready environment.

{EDAName} is a new feature of {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers} that was not available when the reference architecture detailed in Figure 1: Reference architecture overview was originally written. Currently, the supported configuration is a single {ControllerName}, single {HubName}, and single {EDAController} node with external (installer managed) database. For an organization interested in {EDAName}, the recommendation is to install according to the configuration documented in the link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_installation_guide/assembly-platform-install-scenario#ref-single-controller-hub-eda-with-managed-db[{PlatformNameShort} Installation Guide]. This document provides additional clarifications when {EDAName} specific hardening configuration is required.

For smaller production deployments where the full reference architecture may not be needed, this guide recommends deploying {PlatformNameShort} with a dedicated PostgreSQL database server whether managed by the installer or provided externally.
