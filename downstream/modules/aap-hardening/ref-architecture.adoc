= {PlatformNameShort} deployment topologies

[role="_abstract"]

Install {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers} based on one of the documented tested deployment reference architectures defined in {LinkTopologies}. 
Enterprise organizations should use one of the enterprise reference architectures for production deployments to ensure the highest level of uptime, performance, and continued scalability. 
Organizations or deployments that are resource constrained can use a "growth" reference architecture.
Review the {LinkTopologies} document to determine the reference architecture that best suits your requirements. 
The reference architecture chosen will include planning information such as an architecture diagram, the number of {RHEL} servers required, the network ports and protocols used by the deployment, and load balancer information for enterprise architectures.

It is possible to install {PlatformNameShort} on different infrastructure reference architectures and with different environment configurations. Red Hat does not fully test architectures outside of published reference architectures. Red Hat recommends using a tested reference architecture for all new deployments and provides commercially reasonable support for deployments that meet minimum requirements. 

//This diagram might need updating.
The following diagram is a tested container enterprise architecture:
