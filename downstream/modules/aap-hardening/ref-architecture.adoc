= {PlatformNameShort} deployment topologies

[role="_abstract"]

Install {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers} based on one of the documented tested deployment reference architectures defined in link:{LinkTopologies}. 
Enterprise organizations should use one of the enterprise reference architectures for production deployments to ensure the highest level of uptime, performance, and continued scalability. 
Organizations or deployments that are resource constrained can use a "growth" reference architecture.
Review the link:{LinkTopologies} document to determine the reference architecture that best suits your requirements. 
The reference architecture chosen will include planning information such as an architecture diagram, the number of {RHEL} servers required, the network ports and protocols used by the deployment, and load balancer information for enterprise architectures.

It is possible to install {PlatformNameShort} on different infrastructure reference architectures and with different environment configurations. Red Hat does not fully test architectures outside of published reference architectures. Red Hat recommends using a tested reference architecture for all new deployments and provides commercially reasonable support for deployments that meet minimum requirements. 

//This diagram might need to be updated.
The following diagram is a tested container enterprise architecture:

//{EDAName} is a new feature of {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers} that was not available when the reference architecture detailed in Figure 1: Reference architecture overview was originally written. Currently, the supported configuration is a single {ControllerName}, single {HubName}, and single {EDAController} node with external (installer managed) database. For an organization interested in {EDAName}, the recommendation is to install according to the configuration documented in the link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_installation_guide/assembly-platform-install-scenario#ref-single-controller-hub-eda-with-managed-db[{PlatformNameShort} Installation Guide]. This document provides additional clarifications when {EDAName} specific hardening configuration is required.

//For smaller production deployments where the full reference architecture may not be needed, this guide recommends deploying {PlatformNameShort} with a dedicated PostgreSQL database server whether managed by the installer or provided externally.
