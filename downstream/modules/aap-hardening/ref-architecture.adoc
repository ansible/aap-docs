= {PlatformNameShort} reference architecture

[role="_abstract"]

Red Hat recommends that customers always deploy all components of {PlatformNameShort} so that all features and capabilities are available for use without the need to take further action.
Red Hat tests and recommends installing {PlatformNameShort} {PlaformVers} based on a defined set of infrastructure topologies or reference architectures. 
Enterprise organizations should use one of the enterprise topologies for production deployments to ensure the highest level of uptime, performance, and continued scalability. 
Organizations or deployments that are resource constrained can use a "growth" topology.
It is possible to install the {PlatformNameShort} on different infrastructure topologies and with different environment configurations. 
Red Hat does not fully test topologies outside of published reference architectures, and recommends that all new deployments use a tested topology.

The following diagram is a tested container enterprise topology:

//{EDAName} is a new feature of {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers} that was not available when the reference architecture detailed in Figure 1: Reference architecture overview was originally written. Currently, the supported configuration is a single {ControllerName}, single {HubName}, and single {EDAController} node with external (installer managed) database. For an organization interested in {EDAName}, the recommendation is to install according to the configuration documented in the link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_installation_guide/assembly-platform-install-scenario#ref-single-controller-hub-eda-with-managed-db[{PlatformNameShort} Installation Guide]. This document provides additional clarifications when {EDAName} specific hardening configuration is required.

//For smaller production deployments where the full reference architecture may not be needed, this guide recommends deploying {PlatformNameShort} with a dedicated PostgreSQL database server whether managed by the installer or provided externally.
