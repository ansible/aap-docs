For large-scale production environments with availability requirements, this guide recommends deploying the above-mentioned components as described in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/reference_architectures/2021/html-single/deploying_ansible_automation_platform_2.1/index#overview[reference architecture] documentation for {PlatformName} on RHEL. While some variation may make sense for your specific technical requirements, following the reference architecture results in a supported production-ready environment.

{EDAName} (EDA) is a new feature of AAP {PlatformVers} that was not available when the reference architecture detailed in Figure 1: Reference architecture overview was originally written. Currently, the supported configuration for EDA is a single {EDAcontroller} with a dedicated internal database. For an organization interested in EDA, the recommendation is to install according to the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.4/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_installation_guide/assembly-platform-install-scenario#ref-single-eda-controller-with-internal-db_platform-install-scenario[documented configuration]. This document will provide additional clarifications when EDA specific hardening configuration is required.

For smaller production deployments where the full reference architecture may not be needed, this guide recommends deploying AAP with a dedicated PostgreSQL database server whether managed by the installer or provided externally.
