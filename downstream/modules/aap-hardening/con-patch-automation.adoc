= Benefits of patch automation

[role="_abstract"]

Automating the patching process provides a number of benefits:

* Reduce error-prone manual effort.
* Decrease time to deploy patches at scale.
* Consistency of patches across similar systems.  Manual patching of similar systems could result in human error (forgetting one or more, patching using different versions) that impacts consistency.
* Orchestration of complex patching scenarios where an update may require taking a system snapshot before applying a patch or may require additional configuration changes once the patch is applied.
