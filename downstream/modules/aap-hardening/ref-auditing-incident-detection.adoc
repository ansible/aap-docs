= Auditing and incident detection

[role="_abstract"]

{PlatformNameShort} should be used to fulfill security policy requirements by applying the NIST Cybersecurity Framework for common use cases, such as:

* Requiring HTTPS for web servers on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
* Requiring TLS encryption for internal communication between web servers and database servers on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
* Generating reports showing that the policy is properly deployed.
* Monitoring for drift that violates the policy.
* Automating correction of any policy violation.

This can be done through 5 steps of the cybersecurity framework:

* IDENTIFY- Define the requirements to be implemented according to the security policy.
* PROTECT - Implement and apply the requirements as an Ansible playbook.
* DETECT - Monitor for drift and generate an audit report.
* RESPOND - Explore actions that could be taken when an incident is detected.
* RECOVER - Use Ansible to restore the systems to the known good configuration.
