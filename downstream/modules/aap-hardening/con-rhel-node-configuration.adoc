= {RHEL} managed node configuration

[role="_abstract"]

Guidance is provided for _{RHEL}_ (RHEL) managed nodes, but the concepts might be applicable to other Linux distributions as well.

Examples are provided for manual configuration of RHEL managed nodes. 
These steps can also be automated with {PlatformNameShort}, or they can be added to a _Standard Operating Environment_ (SOE) or "golden image" created with a tool such as the {RHLightspeed} image builder.
