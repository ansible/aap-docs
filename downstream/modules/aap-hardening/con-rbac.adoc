= RBAC considerations

[role="_abstract"]

As an administrator, you can use the Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC) built into {ControllerName} to delegate access to server inventories, organizations, and more. Administrators can also centralize the management of various credentials, allowing end users to leverage a needed secret without ever exposing that secret to the end user. RBAC controls allow the controller to help you increase security and streamline management.

RBAC is the practice of granting roles to users or teams. RBACs are easiest to think of in terms of Roles which define precisely who or what can see, change, or delete an “object” for which a specific capability is being set.

There are a few main concepts that you should become familiar with regarding {ControllerName}'s RBAC design–roles, resources, and users. Users can be members of a role, which gives them certain access to any resources associated with that role, or any resources associated with “descendant” roles.

A role is essentially a collection of capabilities. Users are granted access to these capabilities and the controller’s resources through the roles to which they are assigned or through roles inherited through the role hierarchy.

Roles associate a group of capabilities with a group of users. All capabilities are derived from membership within a role. Users receive capabilities only through the roles to which they are assigned or through roles they inherit through the role hierarchy. All members of a role have all capabilities granted to that role. Within an organization, roles are relatively stable, while users and capabilities are both numerous and may change rapidly. Users can have many roles.

For further detail on Role Hierarchy, access inheritance, Built in Roles, permissions, personas, Role Creation, and so on see link:https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/userguide/security.html#role-based-access-controls[Role-Based Access Controls].

The following is an example of an organization with roles and resource permissions:

User access is based on managing permissions to system objects (users, groups, namespaces) rather than by assigning permissions individually to specific users. You can assign permissions to the groups you create. You can then assign users to these groups. This means that each user in a group has the permissions assigned to that group.

Groups created in Automation Hub can range from system administrators responsible for governing internal collections, configuring user access, and repository management to groups with access to organize and upload internally developed content to Automation Hub. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/getting_started_with_automation_hub/index#ref-permissions[Automation Hub permissions] for consistency.

View-only access can be enabled for further lockdown of the {PrivateHubName}. By enabling view-only access, you can grant access for users to view collections or namespaces on your {PrivateHubName} without the need for them to log in. View-only access allows you to share content with unauthorized users while restricting their ability to only view or download source code, without permissions to edit anything on your {PrivateHubName}. Enable view-only access for your {PrivateHubName} by editing the inventory file found on your {PlatformName} installer.
