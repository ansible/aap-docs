= Keeping everything up to date

[role="_abstract"]

For some RHEL servers, such as a lab or other non-production systems, there may be a desire to install all available patches on a regular cadence.  The following example playbook might be used in a job template that is scheduled to run weekly, and will update the system with all of the latest RPMs.

-----
---
- name: Install all available RPM updates
  hosts: target_hosts
  become: true

  tasks:
    - name: Install latest RPMs
      ansible.builtin.dnf:
        name: '*'
        state: latest
