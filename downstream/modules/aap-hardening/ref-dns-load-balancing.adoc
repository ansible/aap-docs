= DNS and load balancing

[role="_abstract"]

When using a load balancer with {PlatformNameShort} as described in the reference architecture, an additional FQDN is needed for each load-balanced component ({ControllerName} and {PrivateHubName}).

For example, if the following hosts are defined in the {PlatformNameShort} installer inventory file:

-----
[automationcontroller]
controller0.example.com
controller1.example.com
controller2.example.com

[automationhub]
hub0.example.com
hub1.example.com
hub2.example.com
-----

Then the load balancer can use the FQDNs `controller.example.com` and `hub.example.com` for the user-facing name of these {PlatformNameShort} services.

When a load balancer is used in front of the {PrivateHubName}, the installer must be aware of the load balancer FQDN. Before installing {PlatformNameShort}, in the installation inventory file set the `automationhub_main_url` variable to the FQDN of the load balancer. For example, to match the previous example, you would set the variable to `automationhub_main_url = hub.example.com`.
