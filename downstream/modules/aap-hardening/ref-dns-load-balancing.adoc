= DNS and load balancing

[role="_abstract"]

When using a load balancer with {PlatformNameShort} as described in the deployment topology, an additional FQDN is needed for the load-balancer.
For example, an FQDN such as `aap.example.com` might be used for the load balancer which in turn directs traffic to each of the {Gateway} components defined in the installation inventory.
