= Protect sensitive data with no_log

[role="_abstract"]
If you save Ansible output to a log, you expose any secret data in your Ansible output, such as passwords and usernames. 
To keep sensitive values out of your logs, mark tasks that expose them with the `no_log: True` attribute. 

However, the `no_log` attribute does not affect debugging output, so be careful not to debug playbooks in a production environment.
