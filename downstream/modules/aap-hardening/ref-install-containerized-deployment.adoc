= Install a Containerized deployment of {PlatformNameShort} with an external vault file

For containerized installations of Ansible Automation Platform, use the following playbook invocation:

`ansible-playbook ansible.containerized_installer.install -e @vault.yml \ --ask-become-pass`

Ensure the vault file is present in the directory where the playbook is invoked, and only include the variables in the vault. 

Do not define the variables in the inventory file.

This modular approach to handling sensitive variables provides a secure and flexible method for both RPM-based and container-based {PlatformNameShort} deployments.
