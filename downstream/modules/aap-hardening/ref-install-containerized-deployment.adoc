= Using an external vault file with a Containerized deployment of {PlatformNameShort}

For containerized installations of Ansible Automation Platform, use the provided automation execution playbook with the external vault file.

Use the following sensitive variables:

postgresql_admin_password:  <secure_password>
gateway_admin_password:  <secure_password>
gateway_pg_password:  <secure_password>
controller_admin_password:  <secure_password>
controller_pg_password:  <secure_password>
hub_admin_password:  <secure_password>
hub_pg_password:  <secure_password>
eda_admin_password:  <secure_password>
eda_pg_password: <secure_password>

To use the new Ansible vault with the {Installer}, ensure the file, for example, `vault.yml`, contains all required sensitive variables and run it with the command 

`ansible-playbook ansible.containerized_installer.install -e @vault.yml â€“ask-become-pass`.

Ensure that the vault file is located in the working directory, or provide the full path. Do not duplicate the encrypted variables in the plaintext inventory file.

By securing sensitive values with ansible vault, both RPM-based and containerized installations of {PlatformNameShort} benefit from improved security, password hygiene, and maintainability.
