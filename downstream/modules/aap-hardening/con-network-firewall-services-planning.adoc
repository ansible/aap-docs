= Network, firewall, and network services planning for {PlatformNameShort}

[role="_abstract"]

When planning firewall or cloud network security group configurations related to {PlatformNameShort}, see the 
"Network Ports" section of your chosen topology in {LinkTopologies} to understand what network ports need to be opened on a firewall or security group.

//For more information on using a load balancer, and for outgoing traffic requirements for services compatible with {PlatformNameShort}. Consult the Red Hat Knowledgebase article link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6756251[What ports need to be opened in the firewall for {PlatformNameShort} 2 Services?]. For internet-connected systems, this article also defines the outgoing traffic requirements for services that {PlatformNameShort} can be configured to use, such as {HubNameMain}, {InsightsName}, {Galaxy}, the registry.redhat.io container image registry, and so on.

For internet-connected systems, the link:{URLPlanningGuide}/ref-network-ports-protocols_planning[Networks and Protocols] section of {TitlePlanningGuide} defines the outgoing traffic requirements for services that {PlatformNameShort} can be configured to use, such as Red Hat {HubName}, {InsightsShort}, {Galaxy}, the registry.redhat.io container image registry, and so on.

Restrict access to the ports used by the {PlatformNameShort} components to protected networks and clients. The following restrictions are highly recommended:

* Restrict the PostgreSQL database port (5432) on the database servers so that only the other {PlatformNameShort} component servers ({ControllerName}, {HubName}, {EDAcontroller}) are permitted access.
* Restrict SSH access to the {PlatformNameShort} servers from the xref:con-install-secure-host_{context}[installation host] and other trusted systems used for maintenance access to the {PlatformNameShort} servers.
* Restrict HTTPS access to the {ControllerName}, {HubName}, and {EDAcontroller} from trusted networks and clients.
