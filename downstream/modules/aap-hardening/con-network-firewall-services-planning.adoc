= Network, firewall, and network services planning for {PlatformNameShort}

[role="_abstract"]

{PlatformNameShort} requires access to a network to integrate to external auxiliary services and to manage target environments and resources such as hosts, other network devices, applications, cloud services. The link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.4/html-single/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_planning_guide/index#ref-network-ports-protocols_planning[network ports and protocols] section of the {PlatformNameShort} planning guide describes how {PlatformNameShort} components interact on the network as well as which ports and protocols are used, as shown in the following diagram:

When planning firewall or cloud network security group configurations related to {PlatformNameShort}, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.4/html-single/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_planning_guide/index#ref-network-ports-protocols_planning[Network ports and protocols] section of the {PlatformNameShort} Planning Guide to understand what network ports need to be opened on a firewall or security group.

For internet-connected systems, this article also defines the outgoing traffic requirements for services that {PlatformNameShort} can be configured to use, such as Red Hat {HubName}, {InsightsShort}, {Galaxy}, the `registry.redhat.io` container image registry, and so on.

Restrict access to the ports used by the {PlatformNameShort} components to protected networks and clients. The following restrictions are highly recommended:

* Restrict the PostgreSQL database port (5432) on the database servers so that only the other {PlatformNameShort} component servers ({ControllerName}, {HubName}, {EDAcontroller}) are permitted access.
* Restrict SSH access to the {PlatformNameShort} servers from the (INERT INTERNAL LINK HERE installation host) and other trusted systems used for maintenance access to the {PlatformNameShort} servers.
* Restrict HTTPS access to the {ControllerName}, {HubName}, and {EDAcontroller} from trusted networks and clients.
