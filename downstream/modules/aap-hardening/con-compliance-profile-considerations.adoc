= Compliance profile considerations

In many environments, {PlatformNameShort} might need to be installed on {RHEL} systems where security controls have been applied to meet the requirements of a compliance profile such as CIS Critical Security Controls, _Payment Card Industry/Data Security Standard_ (PCI/DSS), the DISA STIG, or a similar profile. 
In these environments, there are a specific set of security controls that might need to be modified for {PlatformNameShort} to run properly. 
Apply any compliance profile controls to the {RHEL} servers being used for {PlatformNameShort} before installation, and then modify the following security controls as required.

In environments where these controls are required, discuss waiving the controls with your security auditor.
