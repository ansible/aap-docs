= Compliance profile considerations

[role="_abstract"]
You can use {PlatformNameShort} to manage systems where security controls have been applied to managed RHEL nodes to meet the requirements of a compliance profile such as CIS, PCI/DSS, the DISA STIG, or similar. 

In these environments, there are a specific set of security controls that might need to be modified for {PlatformNameShort} to run properly. 
Apply any compliance profile controls to the {RHEL} servers being used for {PlatformNameShort} before installation, and then modify the following security controls as required.

In environments where these controls are required, discuss waiving the controls with your security auditor.
