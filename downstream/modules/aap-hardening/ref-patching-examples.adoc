= Patching examples

[role="_abstract"]

The following playbooks are provided as patching examples, and should be modified to fit the target environment and tested thoroughly before being used in production.
These examples use the `ansible.builtin.dnf` module for managing packages on RHEL and other operating systems that use the `dnf` package manager.
Modules for patching other Linux distributions, Microsoft Windows, and many network devices are also available.
