= User authentication planning

[role="_abstract"]

When planning user authentication for {PlatformNameShort}, consider both infrastructure-level and application-level authentication requirements.    

There are two types of user accounts to consider in an {PlatformNameShort} environment:

* Infrastructure accounts: user accounts on the RHEL servers that run the {PlatformNameShort} services.
* Application accounts: user accounts for the {PlatformNameShort} web UI and API.
