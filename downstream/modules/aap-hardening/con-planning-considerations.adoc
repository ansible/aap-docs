{PlatformName} is composed of the following primary components:

* {ControllerNameStart}
* {AutomationMeshStart}
* {PrivateHubNameStart}
* {EDAcontroller}

A PostgreSQL database is also provided, although a user-provided PostgreSQL database can be used as well.
Red Hat recommends that customers always deploy all components of {PlatformNameShort} so that all features and capabilities are available for use without the need to take further action.
