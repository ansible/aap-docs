{PlatformName} is composed of the following primary components:

* {ControllerNameStart}
* {AutomationMeshStart}
* {PrivateHubNameStart}
* {EDAcontroller}

Although a PostgreSQL database can be installed as part of the {PlatformNameShort} deployment, use a user-provided PostgreSQL database.
Red Hat recommends that customers always deploy all components of {PlatformNameShort} so that all features and capabilities are available for use without the need to take further action.
