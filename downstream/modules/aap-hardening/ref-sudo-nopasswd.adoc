= Sudo and NOPASSWD

[role="_abstract"]

The Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 STIG requires that all users with sudo privileges must provide a password (that is, the "NOPASSWD" directive must not be used in a sudoers file). The {PlatformNameShort} (AAP) installer runs many tasks as a privileged user, and by default expects to be able to elevate privileges without a password. To provide a password to the installer for elevating privileges, append the following options when launching the installer script: `./setup.sh <setup options> -- â€“-ask-become-pass`.

This also applies when running the installer script for day-two operations such as backup and restore.
