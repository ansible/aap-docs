= Sudo and NOPASSWD

A compliance profile might require that all users with sudo privileges must provide a password (that is, the `NOPASSWD` directive must not be used in a sudoers file). 
The {PlatformNameShort} installation program runs many tasks as a privileged user, and by default expects to be able to elevate privileges without a password. 
To provide a password to the {Installer} for elevating privileges, append the following options when launching the RPM installer script: 

`./setup.sh <setup options> --ask-become-pass`.

For the container-based {Installer}: 

`ansible-playbook ansible.containerized_installer.install --ask-become-pass`

When the {Installer} is run, you are prompted for the user's password to elevate privileges.

[NOTE]
====
Using the `--ask-become-pass` option also applies when running the {Installer} for day-two operations such as backup and restore.
