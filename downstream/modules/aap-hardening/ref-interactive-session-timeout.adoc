=  Interactive session timeout

[role="_abstract"]
A compliance profile might require that an interactive session timeout be enforced. 
For example, the DISA STIG requires that all users be automatically logged out after 15 minutes of inactivity. 
The installation process often requires an hour or more to complete, and this control can stop the installation process and log out the user before installation is complete. 
The same also applies to day two operations such as backup and restore, which in production environments often take longer than the recommended interactive session timeout. 
During these operations, increase the interactive session timeout to ensure the operation is successful.

There are multiple ways in which this control can be enforced, including shell timeout variables, setting the idle session timeout for `systemd-logind`, or setting SSH connection timeouts, and different compliance profiles can use one or more of these methods. 
The one that most often interrupts the installation and day two operations is the idle session timeout for `systemd-logind`, which was introduced in the DISA STIG version V2R1 ({RHEL} 8) and V2R2 ({RHEL} 9). To increase the idle session timeout for `systemd-logind`, as the root user:

* Edit the file `/etc/systemd/logind.conf`.
* If the `StopIdleSessionSec` setting is set to zero, no change is needed.
* If the `StopIdleSessionSec` setting is non-zero, this indicates that the session will be terminated after that number of seconds. 
+
Change `StopIdleSessionSec=7200` to increase the timeout, then run `systemctl restart systemd-logind` to apply the change.
* Log out of the interactive session entirely and log back in to ensure the new setting applies to the current login session.

[NOTE]
====
This change only needs to be made on the installation host, or if an installation host is not used, the host where the {PlatformNameShort} {Installer} is run.
