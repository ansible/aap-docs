= Configuring {PlatformNameShort} to communicate with HashiCorp vault

In an enterprise environment, having externally managed secrets is a convenient way to manage sensitive data across multiple services. 
One of the most common and recommended authentication methods for the HashiCorp vault is to use AppRoles with policies and login requirements that must be satisfied before a token is issued.
To configure {PlatformNameShort} to use secrets stored in HashiCorp vault, set up a new credential with the type of HashiCorp Vault Secret Lookup. 
For information on how to do this, see link:{URLControllerAdminGuide}/assembly-controller-secret-management#ref-hashicorp-vault-lookup[Hashicorp vault secret lookup]. 

Enter relevant information such as an identifiable credential name, organization, and the URL of the vault server, for example, https://vault.domain.com:8200.

Populate the necessary fields with your information such as Token, AppRole role_id, and AppRole secret_id, then select v2 for the API version.

To test the credential to test for functionally and operation, use the following procedure: 

.Procedure
. Before clicking on *Create Credential*, click btn:[Test]. 
. In the pop-up box, enter the *Path to Secret* and the *Key Name*. 
+
[NOTE]
====
The *Path to Secret* will be prefixed by `kv` if storing a key-value pair, for example, `kv/key_name`.
==== 

. Click btn:[Run]. 
. When the test is successful, click btn:[Create Credential]. 
. When complete, {PlatformNameShort} is properly configured to use HashiCorp Vault as an external secret source.
