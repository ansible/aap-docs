Granting access to certain parts of {PlatformNameShort} increases security risk. 

Apply the following practices to help secure access:

* Minimize access to system administrative accounts. 
There is a difference between the user interface (web interface) and access to the infrastructure nodes that {PlatformNameShort} is running on. 
A system administrator or super user can access, edit, and disrupt any system application. 
Anyone with root access to {PlatformNameShort} infrastructure nodes has the potential ability to decrypt stored credentials, so minimizing access to system administrative accounts is crucial for maintaining a secure system.
* Minimize local system access. {PlatformNameShort} infrastructure nodes should not require local user access except for administrative purposes. 
Non-administrator users should not have access to the {PlatformNameShort} infrastructure nodes.
* Enforce separation of duties. 
Different components of automation might need to access a system at different levels. 
Use different keys or credentials for each component so that the effect of any one key or credential vulnerability is minimized.
* In the {PlatformNameShort} UI, any account with “system administrator” privileges can edit, change, and update any inventory or automation resource. Restrict these account privileges to the minimum set of users necessary for {PlatformNameShort} administration and maintenance.
