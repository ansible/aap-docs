= Use a configuration as code paradigm

[role="_abstract"]

The Red Hat Community of Practice has created a set of automation content available through collections to manage {PlatformNameShort} infrastructure and configuration as code. 
This enables automation of the platform itself through _Configuration as Code_ (CaC). 
While many of the benefits of this approach are clear, there are security implications to consider.

The following Ansible content collections are available for managing {PlatformNameShort} components using an infrastructure as code methodology, all of which are found on the link:https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub[Ansible Automation Hub]:

.Ansible content collections
|===
| *Validated Collection* | *Collection Purpose*
| `infra.aap_utilities` | Ansible content for automating day 1 and day 2 operations of {PlatformNameShort}, including installation, backup and restore, certificate management, and more.

| `infra.aap_configuration` | A collection of roles to manage the creation of {PlatformNameShort} components, including users and groups (RBAC), projects, job templates and workflows, credentials, and more. This collection includes functionality from the older `infra.controller_configuration`, `infra.ah_configuration` and `infra.eda_configuration` and should be used in their place with {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers}.

| `infra.ee_utilities` | A collection of roles for creating and managing {ExecEnvShort} images, or migrating from the older Ansible Tower virtualenvs to execution environments.
|===

Many organizations use CI/CD platforms to configure pipelines or other methods to manage this type of infrastructure. 
However, using {PlatformNameShort} natively, a webhook can be configured to link a git-based repository natively. 
In this way, {PlatformNameShort} can respond to git events to trigger Job Templates directly. 
This removes the need for external CI components from this overall process and thus reduces the attack surface.

These practices enable version control of all infrastructure and configuration. 
Apply git best practices to ensure proper code quality inspection before being synchronized into {PlatformNameShort}. Relevant git best practices include the following: 

* Creating pull requests and review new code before merging.
* Ensuring that inspection tools are in place.
* Ensuring that no plain text secrets are committed.
* Ensuring that pre-commit hooks and any other policies are followed.

CaC also encourages using external credential management systems which removes the need to store any sensitive data in the repository, or deal with having to individually vault files as needed. 
This is particularly important when storing {PlatformNameShort} configuration in a source code repository, as {ControllerName} credentials and {EDAName} credentials must be provided to the collection variables in plain text which should not be committed to a source repository.
