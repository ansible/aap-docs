= Implement security control for each host

[role="_abstract"]
{ControllerNameStart}'s log files must be accessible by explicitly defined privilege. 
A failure of the confidentiality of {ControllerName} log files would enable an attacker to identify key information about the system that they might not otherwise be able to obtain that would enable them to enumerate more information to enable escalation or lateral movement. 

To implement the security control on RPM deployments, use the following procedure:

.Procedure
. As a system administrator for each {ControllerName} host, set the permissions and owner of the {ControllerName} NGINX log directory:

* `chmod 770 /var/log/nginx`
* `chown nginx:root /var/log/nginx`

. Set the permissions and owner of the {ControllerName} log directory:

* `chmod 770 /var/log/tower`
* `chown awx:awx /var/log/tower`

. Set the permissions and owner of the {controllerName} supervisor log directory:

* `chmod 770 /var/log/supervisor/`
* `chown root:root /var/log/supervisor/`
