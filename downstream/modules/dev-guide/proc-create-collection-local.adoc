= Creating a collection locally

[role="_abstract"]
The following steps describe the process for developing a new collection locally, using tools available in the Ansible VSCode extension.

The `ansible-creator` tool helps you write your own collections. You create the collection using Ansible Creator in the Ansible VSCode extension.
You can run playbooks from VSCode with either the ansible-playbook or ansible-navigator tool.

.Procedure

. Install the Ansible VSCode extension.
. Create a workspace in VSCode.
. Create a virtual environment to develop your collection locally. >>>>> Aine CHECK THIS
. Open your workspace in VSCode.
. Click the Ansible icon in the VSCode activity bar to open the Ansible extension in VSCode.
. In the *ANSIBLE CREATOR* section of the Ansible extension, click btn:[Get started].
. Check that the system requirements are met.
All requirements that are satisfied have green ticks next to them.
You can check your installed versions of the Ansible components by running `pip freeze | grep ansible` in a terminal.
. Scroll past the system requirements and click btn:[Initialize Ansible collection].
. In the *Ansible Creator: Init* tab, enter a namespace and collection name for your new collection. 
The collection is created in the default location, which is specified in the *Init path*. 
Modify this path if you want your collection to be created in another location.

. Click btn:[Create]
. When your new collection has been created, the following message is displayed in the *Ansible Content Creator* tab in VSCode:

```
    Note: collection sample_ns.devtools_demo created at
          /Users/username/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections
   Debug: exiting ansible-creator

Process exited with status: success and code: 0
```

Your new collection is located in the `/<namespace>/<collection_name>/` subdirectory that you specified before you initialized the collection.
To check that your collection has been created, run `ansible-galaxy collection list | grep <namespace>`.
. Click btn:[Open Collection] to view your new collection. This action also adds your new collection to your workspace. 
You can view the content that Ansible Content Creator has created by clicking the *File Explorer* icon in the VSCode activity bar.
