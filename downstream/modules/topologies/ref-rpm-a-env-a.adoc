= RPM {GrowthTopology}

[role="_abstract"]
The RPM-based {GrowthTopology} provides a smaller footprint deployment without redundancy for organizations getting started with {PlatformNameShort}. 
Included are the tested infrastructure topology, system requirements, network port configurations, and an example inventory file for installation.

== Infrastructure topology
The Red{nbsp}Hat tested infrastructure topology for this deployment model:

Red Hat tests each VM with these requirements:

.Infrastructure topology components
[options="header"]
|====
| VM count | Purpose | Example VM group names
| 1 | {GatewayStart} with colocated Redis | `automationgateway` 
| 1 | {ControllerNameStart} | `automationcontroller`
| 1 | {PrivateHubNameStart} | `automationhub`
| 1 | {EDAName} | `automationedacontroller`
| 1 | {AutomationMeshStart} execution node | `execution_nodes`
| 1 | {PlatformNameShort} managed database | `database`
|====

== Tested system configurations

Red{nbsp}Hat has tested these configurations to install and run {PlatformName}:

include::snippets/rpm-env-a-tested-system-config.adoc[]

== Network ports

{PlatformName} uses several ports to communicate with its services. 
These ports must be open and available for {PlatformName} to work. 
Ensure that these ports are available and are not blocked by a firewall.
