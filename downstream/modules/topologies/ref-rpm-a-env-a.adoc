= RPM {GrowthTopology}

[role="_abstract"]
The RPM-based {GrowthTopology} is designed for organizations getting started with {PlatformNameShort} and provides a smaller footprint deployment without redundancy. Included are the tested infrastructure topology, system requirements, network port configurations, and an example inventory file for installation.

== Infrastructure topology
The following diagram shows the Red{nbsp}Hat tested infrastructure topology for this deployment model:

Each VM has been tested with the following component requirements:

|====
| VM count | Purpose | Example VM group names
| 1 | {GatewayStart} with colocated Redis | `automationgateway` 
| 1 | {ControllerNameStart} | `automationcontroller`
| 1 | {PrivateHubNameStart} | `automationhub`
| 1 | {EDAName} | `automationedacontroller`
| 1 | {AutomationMeshStart} execution node | `execution_nodes`
| 1 | {PlatformNameShort} managed database | `database`

== Tested system configurations

Red{nbsp}Hat has tested the following configurations to install and run {PlatformName}:

== Network ports

{PlatformName} uses several ports to communicate with its services. These ports must be open and available for incoming connections to the {PlatformName} server for it to work. Ensure that these ports are available and are not blocked by the server firewall.
