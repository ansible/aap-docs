== Tested system configurations

Red{nbsp}Hat has tested the following configurations to install and run {PlatformName}:

== Network ports

{PlatformName} uses several ports to communicate with its services. These ports must be open and available for incoming connections to the {PlatformName} server for it to work. Ensure that these ports are available and are not blocked by the server firewall.
