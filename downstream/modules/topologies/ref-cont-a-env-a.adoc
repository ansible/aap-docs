= Container growth topology

The growth topology is intended for organizations that are getting started with {PlatformNameShort} and do not require redundancy or higher compute for large volumes of automation. This topology allows for smaller footprint deployments.

== Infrastructure topology
The following diagram outlines the infrastructure topology that Red{nbsp}Hat has tested with this deployment model that customers can use when self-managing {PlatformNameShort}:

.Infrastructure topology diagram
image::cont-a-env-a.png[Container growth topology diagram]

A single VM has been tested with the following component requirements: 16 GB RAM, 4 CPUs, 60 GB local disk, and 3000 IOPS. Resources, such as storage, can be increased based on the needs of the deployment.

If performing a bundled installation with `hub_seed_collections=true`, then 32 GB RAM is recommended. Note that with this configuration, install times can take 45 minutes or more to complete.

| Type | Description 
| Subscription 
a| 
* Valid {PlatformName} subscription
* Valid {RHEL} subscription (to consume the BaseOS and AppStream repositories)
| Operating system | {RHEL} 9.2 or later
| CPU architecture | x86_64, AArch64, s390x (IBM Z), ppc64le (IBM Power)
| Ansible-core | Ansible-core version {CoreInstVers} or later

| Database | {PostgresVers}
|====

== Network ports

{PlatformName} uses several ports to communicate with its services. These ports must be open and available for incoming connections to the {PlatformName} server for it to work. Ensure that these ports are available and are not blocked by the server firewall.

== Example growth inventory file
Use the example inventory file to perform an installation for this topology: 

include::snippets/inventory-cont-a-env-a.adoc[]

SSH keys are only required when installing on remote hosts. If doing a self contained local VM based installation, you can use `ansible_connection=local`.
