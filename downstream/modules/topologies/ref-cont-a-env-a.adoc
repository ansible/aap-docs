= Container {GrowthTopology}

[role="_abstract"]
The container-based {GrowthTopology} provides a smaller footprint deployment without redundancy for organizations getting started with {PlatformNameShort}. 
Included are the tested infrastructure topology, system requirements, network port configurations, and an example inventory file for installation.

== Infrastructure topology
The Red{nbsp}Hat tested infrastructure topology for this deployment model:

Red Hat tests a single VM with these requirements: 

include::snippets/cont-tested-vm-config.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
If performing a bundled installation of the {GrowthTopology} with `hub_seed_collections=true`, then 32 GB RAM is recommended. With this configuration, the install time will increase. Seeding the collections can take 45 or more minutes.

| Purpose | Example group names
| All {PlatformNameShort} components 
a| 
* `automationgateway` 
* `automationcontroller` 
* `automationhub` 
* `automationeda`
* `database`

== Tested system configurations

Red{nbsp}Hat has tested these configurations to install and run {PlatformName}:

== Network ports

{PlatformName} uses several ports to communicate with its services. 
These ports must be open and available for {PlatformName} to work. 
Ensure that these ports are available and are not blocked by a firewall.

| 27199 | TCP | Receptor | {ControllerNameStart} | Execution container | Mesh nodes connect directly to controllers. Allows two-way communication for job distribution.
| 8080/8443 | TCP | HTTP/HTTPS | {GatewayStart} | {ControllerNameStart} | {ControllerNameStart} NGINX ports. You can configure these ports with the following inventory variables: `controller_nginx_http_port`, `controller_nginx_https_port`.
| 8081/8444 | TCP | HTTP/HTTPS | {GatewayStart} | {HubNameStart} | {HubNameStart} NGINX ports. You can configure these ports with the following inventory variables: `hub_nginx_http_port`, `hub_nginx_https_port`.
| 8082/8445 | TCP | HTTP/HTTPS | {GatewayStart} | {EDAName} | {EDAName} NGINX ports. You can configure these ports with the following inventory variables: `eda_nginx_http_port`, `eda_nginx_https_port`.
| 8083/8446 | TCP | HTTP/HTTPS | {GatewayStart} | {GatewayStart} | {GatewayStart} NGINX ports. You can configure these ports with the following inventory variables: `gateway_nginx_http_port`, `gateway_nginx_https_port`.

[NOTE]
====
If you change any port values by using inventory variables, refer to link:{URLContainerizedInstall}/appendix-inventory-files-vars[Inventory file variables] to review all default port values and ensure there are no port conflicts.
====

== Example inventory file
Use the example inventory file to perform an installation: 

include::snippets/inventory-cont-a-env-a.adoc[]

SSH keys are only required when installing on remote hosts. If doing a self contained local VM based installation, you can use `ansible_connection=local`.
