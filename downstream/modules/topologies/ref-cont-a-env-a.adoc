= Container growth topology

The growth topology is intended for organizations that are getting started with {PlatformNameShort} and do not require redundancy or higher compute for large volumes of automation. This topology allows for smaller footprint deployments.

== Infrastructure topology
The following diagram outlines the infrastructure topology that Red{nbsp}Hat has tested with this deployment model that customers can use when self-managing {PlatformNameShort}:

.Infrastructure topology diagram
image::cont-a-env-a.png[Container growth topology diagram]

A single VM has been tested with the following component requirements: 16 GB RAM, 4 CPUs, 60 GB local disk, and 3000 IOPS. Resources, such as storage, can be increased based on the needs of the deployment.

If performing a bundled installation with `hub_seed_collections=true`, then 32 GB RAM is recommended. Note that with this configuration the install time is going to increase and can take 45 or more minutes alone to complete seeding the collections.

| Type | Description 
| Subscription 
a| 
* Valid {PlatformName} subscription
* Valid {RHEL} subscription (to consume the BaseOS and AppStream repositories)
| Operating system | {RHEL} 9.2 or later

| Database | {PostgresVers}
|====

== Network ports

{PlatformName} uses several ports to communicate with its services. These ports must be open and available for incoming connections to the {PlatformName} server for it to work. Ensure that these ports are available and are not blocked by the server firewall.

== Example growth inventory file
Use the example inventory file to perform an installation for this topology: 

include::snippets/inventory-cont-a-env-a.adoc[]

SSH keys are only required when installing on remote hosts. If doing a self contained local VM based installation, you can use `ansible_connection=local`.
