== Infrastructure topology
The following diagram outlines the infrastructure topology that Red{nbsp}Hat has tested with this deployment model that customers can use when self-managing {PlatformNameShort}:

A single VM has been tested with the following component requirements: 

include::snippets/cont-tested-vm-config.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
If performing a bundled installation of the {GrowthTopology} with `hub_seed_collections=true`, then 32 GB RAM is recommended. Note that with this configuration the install time is going to increase and can take 45 or more minutes alone to complete seeding the collections.

== Tested system configurations

Red{nbsp}Hat has tested the following configurations to install and run {PlatformName}:

include::snippets/cont-tested-system-config.adoc[]


== Network ports

{PlatformName} uses several ports to communicate with its services. These ports must be open and available for incoming connections to the {PlatformName} server for it to work. Ensure that these ports are available and are not blocked by the server firewall.

== Example inventory file
Use the example inventory file to perform an installation for this topology: 

include::snippets/inventory-cont-a-env-a.adoc[]

SSH keys are only required when installing on remote hosts. If doing a self contained local VM based installation, you can use `ansible_connection=local`.
