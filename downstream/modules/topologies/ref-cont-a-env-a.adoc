= Container growth topology

The growth topology is intended for organizations that do not require {PlatformNameShort} to be deployed with redundancy or higher compute for large volumes of automation.

== Infrastructure topology

Each VM has been tested with the following component requirements: 16 GB RAM, 4 CPU, 60 GB local disk, and 3000 IOPS. Resources, such as storage, can be increased based on the needs of the deployment.
