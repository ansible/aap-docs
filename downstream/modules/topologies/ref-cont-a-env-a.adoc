= Container {GrowthTopology}

[role="_abstract"]
The container-based {GrowthTopology} provides a smaller footprint deployment without redundancy for organizations getting started with {PlatformNameShort}. 
Included are the tested infrastructure topology, system requirements, network port configurations, and an example inventory file for installation.

== Infrastructure topology
The Red{nbsp}Hat tested infrastructure topology for this deployment model:

Red Hat tests a single VM with these requirements: 

include::snippets/cont-tested-vm-config.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
If performing a bundled installation of the {GrowthTopology} with `hub_seed_collections=true`, then 32 GB RAM is recommended. With this configuration, the install time will increase. Seeding the collections can take 45 or more minutes.

| Purpose | Example group names
| All {PlatformNameShort} components

* `automationgateway` 
* `automationcontroller` 
* `automationhub` 
* `automationeda`
* `database`

== Tested system configurations

Red{nbsp}Hat has tested these configurations to install and run {PlatformName}:

== Network ports

{PlatformName} uses several ports to communicate with its services. 
These ports must be open and available for {PlatformName} to work. 
Ensure that these ports are available and are not blocked by a firewall.

== Example inventory file
Use the example inventory file to perform an installation: 

include::snippets/inventory-cont-a-env-a.adoc[]

SSH keys are only required when installing on remote hosts. If doing a self contained local VM based installation, you can use `ansible_connection=local`.
