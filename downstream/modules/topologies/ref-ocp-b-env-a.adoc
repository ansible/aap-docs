= Operator {EnterpriseTopology}

[role="_abstract"]
The Operator-based {EnterpriseTopology} provides redundancy and higher compute for large volumes of automation on {OCP}. 
The {SaaSonAWSShort} is an example of an OpenShift Operator based enterprise topology. 
Included are the tested infrastructure topology, system requirements, network port configurations, and an example custom resource file for installation.

== Infrastructure topology

The Red{nbsp}Hat tested infrastructure topology for this deployment model:

.Infrastructure topology diagram
image::ocp-b-env-a.png[Operator {EnterpriseTopology} diagram]

[IMPORTANT]
====
While Redis and PostgreSQL can be installed as part of the operator-based installation process, the topology diagram represents a Red Hat supported topology where both Redis and PostgreSQL are external to {PlatformNameShort}.
====

This infrastructure topology describes an OpenShift Cluster with 3 primary nodes and 2 worker nodes.

Red Hat tests each OpenShift Worker node with these requirements: 16 GB RAM, 4 CPUs, 128 GB local disk, and 3000 IOPS.

== Example custom resource file 

For example CR files, see the link:https://github.com/ansible/test-topologies/blob/aap-2.5/ocp-b.env-a/README.md[ocp-b.env-a] directory in the `test-topologies` GitHub repository.

== Nonfunctional requirements

{PlatformNameShort}'s performance characteristics and capacity depend on its resource allocation and configuration. 
With OpenShift, each {PlatformNameShort} component deploys as a pod. You can specify resource requests and limits for each pod. 

Use the {PlatformNameShort} custom resource to configure resource allocation for OpenShift installations. 
Each configurable item has default settings. 
These settings are the exact configuration used in this reference deployment architecture. 
This configuration assumes deployment and management by an Enterprise IT organization for production purposes.

By default, each component's deployments use minimum resource requests but no resource limits. 
OpenShift only schedules pods with available resource requests. However, pods can consume unlimited RAM or CPU as long as the OpenShift worker node is not under node pressure.

In the Operator {EnterpriseTopology}, {PlatformNameShort} runs on a Red Hat OpenShift on AWS (ROSA) Hosted Control Plane (HCP) cluster. 
The cluster has 2 t3.xlarge worker nodes spread across 2 AWS availability zones within a single region. 
This is not a shared environment so {PlatformNameShort} pods have full access to all compute resources of the ROSA HCP cluster. 

The capacity calculation for {ControllerName} task pods comes from the underlying HCP worker node running the pod. 
It does not have access to the CPU or memory resources of the entire node. 
This capacity calculation influences how many concurrent jobs {ControllerName} can run.

OpenShift manages storage distinctly from VMs. 
This impacts how {HubName} stores its artifacts. 
In the Operator {EnterpriseTopology}, {HubName} uses S3 storage. 
{HubName} requires `ReadWriteMany` type storage, which is not a default storage type in OpenShift. 

This topology specifies externally provided Redis, PostgreSQL, and object storage for {HubName}. 
This provides additional scalability and reliability features for the {PlatformNameShort} deployment. 
These features include specialized backup, restore, and replication services, as well as scalable storage.


== Network ports

{PlatformName} uses several ports to communicate with its services. 
These ports must be open and available for {PlatformName} to work. 
Ensure that these ports are available and are not blocked by a firewall.
