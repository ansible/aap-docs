= Container enterprise topology

The enterprise topology is intended for organizations that require {PlatformNameShort} to be deployed with redundancy or higher compute for large volumes of automation.

== Infrastructure topology

Each VM has been tested with the following component requirements: 16 GB RAM, 4 CPUs, 60 GB local disk, and 3000 IOPS.

| Type | Description 
| Subscription 
a| 
* Valid {PlatformName} subscription
* Valid {RHEL} subscription (to consume the BaseOS and AppStream repositories)
| Operating system | {RHEL} 9.2 or later 64-bit (x86_64)
| Ansible-core | Ansible-core version 2.15 or later
| Browser | A currently supported version of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.
| Database | PostgreSQL version 15

== Network ports

{PlatformName} uses several ports to communicate with its services. These ports must be open and available for incoming connections to the {PlatformName} server in order for it to work. Ensure that these ports are available and are not blocked by the server firewall.

== Storage requirements
* Execution environments are pulled into {ControllerName} hybrid nodes and execution nodes that run jobs. The size of these containers influences the storage requirements for `$PATH_WHERE_PODMAN_PUTS_CONTAINER_IMAGES`.

* The primary determining factors for the size of the database and its storage volume, which defaults to `$POSTGRES_DEFAULT_DATA_DIR`, are:
** The quantity of job events (lines of output from {ControllerName} jobs) 
** The quantity of days of job data that are retained

* On execution nodes and {ControllerName} control and hybrid nodes, job output is buffered to the disk in `$NAME_OF_RECEPTOR_DIR_VAR`, which defaults to `/tmp`.

* The size and quantity of collections synced to {HubName} influence the storage requirements of `$PATH_WHERE_PULP_STORES_COLLECTIONS`.
