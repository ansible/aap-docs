= Container enterprise topology

The enterprise topology is intended for organizations that require {PlatformNameShort} to be deployed with redundancy or higher compute for large volumes of automation.

== Infrastructure topology
The following diagram outlines the infrastructure topology that Red{nbsp}Hat has tested with this deployment model that customers can use when self-managing {PlatformNameShort}:

.Infrastructure topology diagram

Each VM has been tested with the following component requirements: 16 GB RAM, 4 CPUs, 60 GB local disk, and 3000 IOPS.

[options="header"]
|====
| Type | Description 
| Subscription 
a| 
* Valid {PlatformName} subscription
* Valid {RHEL} subscription (to consume the BaseOS and AppStream repositories)
| Operating system | {RHEL} 9.2 or later
| CPU architecture | x86_64, AArch64, s390x (IBM Z), ppc64le (IBM Power)
| Ansible-core | Ansible-core version {CoreInstVers} or later

== Network ports

{PlatformName} uses several ports to communicate with its services. These ports must be open and available for incoming connections to the {PlatformName} server for it to work. Ensure that these ports are available and are not blocked by the server firewall.

== Example enterprise inventory file
Use the example inventory file to perform an installation for this topology: 

include::snippets/inventory-cont-b-env-a.adoc[]

== Storage requirements
* Execution environments are pulled into {ControllerName} hybrid nodes and execution nodes that run jobs. The size of these containers influences the storage requirements for `$PATH_WHERE_PODMAN_PUTS_CONTAINER_IMAGES`.

* The primary determining factors for the size of the database and its storage volume, which defaults to `$POSTGRES_DEFAULT_DATA_DIR`, are:
** The quantity of job events (lines of output from {ControllerName} jobs) 
** The quantity of days of job data that are retained

* On execution nodes and {ControllerName} control and hybrid nodes, job output is buffered to the disk in `$NAME_OF_RECEPTOR_DIR_VAR`, which defaults to `/tmp`.

* The size and quantity of collections synced to {HubName} influence the storage requirements of `$PATH_WHERE_PULP_STORES_COLLECTIONS`.
