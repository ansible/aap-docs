= Container {EnterpriseTopology}

[role="_abstract"]
The container-based {EnterpriseTopology} is designed for organizations that require {PlatformNameShort} to be deployed with redundancy or higher compute for large volumes of automation. Included are the tested infrastructure topology, system requirements, network port configurations, and an example inventory file for installation.

== Infrastructure topology
The following diagram shows the Red{nbsp}Hat tested infrastructure topology for this deployment model:

Each VM has been tested with the following component requirements:

| 2 | {PrivateHubNameStart} with colocated Redis | `automationhub`
| 2 | {EDAName} with colocated Redis | `automationeda`
| 1 | {AutomationMeshStart} hop node | `execution_nodes`
| 2 | {AutomationMeshStart} execution node | `execution_nodes`

== Tested system configurations

Red{nbsp}Hat has tested the following configurations to install and run {PlatformName}:

include::snippets/cont-tested-system-config.adoc[]

== Network ports

{PlatformName} uses several ports to communicate with its services. These ports must be open and available for incoming connections to the {PlatformName} server for it to work. Ensure that these ports are available and are not blocked by the server firewall.

== Example inventory file
Use the example inventory file to perform an installation: 

include::snippets/inventory-cont-b-env-a.adoc[]

// Michelle: Removing this section until documentation can be improved - See AAP-42854
// == Storage requirements
// * Execution environments are pulled into {ControllerName} hybrid nodes and execution nodes that run jobs. The size of these containers influences the storage requirements for `$PATH_WHERE_PODMAN_PUTS_CONTAINER_IMAGES`.

// * The primary determining factors for the size of the database and its storage volume, which defaults to `$POSTGRES_DEFAULT_DATA_DIR`, are:
// ** The quantity of job events (lines of output from {ControllerName} jobs) 
// ** The quantity of days of job data that are retained

// * On execution nodes and {ControllerName} control and hybrid nodes, job output is buffered to the disk in `$NAME_OF_RECEPTOR_DIR_VAR`, which defaults to `/tmp`.

// * The size and quantity of collections synced to {HubName} influence the storage requirements of `$PATH_WHERE_PULP_STORES_COLLECTIONS`.
