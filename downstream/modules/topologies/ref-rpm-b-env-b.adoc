= RPM mixed enterprise topology

The enterprise topology is intended for organizations that require {PlatformNameShort} to be deployed with redundancy or higher compute for large volumes of automation. The mixed topology has different versions of {PlatformNameShort} intended for configuring a new installation of {EDAcontroller} 1.1 with {ControllerName} 4.4 or 4.5.

== Infrastructure topology

Each VM has been tested with the following component requirements: 16 GB RAM, 4 CPU, 60 GB local disk, and 3000 IOPS.
