= Operator growth topology

The growth topology is intended for organizations that are getting started with {PlatformNameShort} and do not require redundancy or higher compute for large volumes of automation. This topology allows for smaller footprint deployments.

== Infrastructure topology
The following diagram outlines the infrastructure topology that Red{nbsp}Hat has tested with this deployment model that customers can use when self-managing {PlatformNameShort}:

A Single Node OpenShift (SNO) cluster has been tested with the following requirements: 32 GB RAM, 16 CPUs, 128 GB local disk, and 3000 IOPS.

== Example custom resource file 

Use the following example custom resource (CR) to add your {PlatformNameShort} instance to your project:

====
----
apiVersion: aap.ansible.com/v1alpha1
kind: AnsibleAutomationPlatform
metadata:
  name: <aap instance name>
spec:
  eda:
    automation_server_ssl_verify: 'no'
  hub:
    storage_type: 's3'
    object_storage_s3_secret: '<name of the Secret resource holding s3 configuration>'
----

== Nonfunctional requirements

{PlatformNameShort}'s performance characteristics and capacity are impacted by its resource allocation and configuration. With OpenShift, each {PlatformNameShort} component is deployed as a pod. You can specify resource requests and limits for each pod. 

Use the {PlatformNameShort} Custom Resource (CR) to configure resource allocation for OpenShift installations. Each configurable item has default settings. These settings are the minimum requirements for an installation, but might not meet your production workload needs. 

By default, each component's deployments are set for minimum resource requests but no resource limits. OpenShift only schedules the pods with available resource requests, but the pods are allowed to consume unlimited RAM or CPU provided that the OpenShift worker node itself is not under node pressure.

In the Operator growth topology, {PlatformNameShort} is deployed on a Single Node OpenShift (SNO) with 32 GB RAM, 16 CPUs, 128 GB Local disk, and 3000 IOPS. This is not a shared environment, so {PlatformNameShort} pods have full access to all of the compute resources of the OpenShift SNO. In this scenario, the capacity calculation for the {ControllerName} task pods is derived from the underlying {OCPShort} node that runs the pod. It does not have access to the entire node. This capacity calculation influences how many concurrent jobs {ControllerName} can run. 

OpenShift manages storage distinctly from VMs. This impacts how {HubName} stores its artifacts. In the Operator growth topology, we use S3 storage because {HubName} requires a `ReadWriteMany` type storage, which is not a default storage type in OpenShift.

== Network ports

{PlatformName} uses several ports to communicate with its services. These ports must be open and available for incoming connections to the {PlatformName} server for it to work. Ensure that these ports are available and are not blocked by the server firewall.
