= {AutomationMeshStart} nodes

[role="_abstract"]
{AutomationMeshStart} is an overlay network that distributes automation work across large and dispersed collections of workers through peer-to-peer node connections. Included are the tested system configurations and network port requirements for mesh nodes. 

== Tested system configurations
Each {AutomationMesh} VM has been tested with the following component requirements: 16 GB RAM, 4 CPUs, 60 GB local disk, and 3000 IOPS.

== Network ports
{AutomationMeshStart} uses several ports to communicate with its services. These ports must be open and available for incoming connections to the {PlatformName} server for it to work. Ensure that these ports are available and are not blocked by the server firewall.
