= RPM enterprise topology

The enterprise topology is intended for organizations that require {PlatformNameShort} to be deployed with redundancy or higher compute for large volumes of automation.

== Infrastructure topology

Each virtual machine (VM) has been tested with the following component requirements: 16 GB RAM, 4 CPUs, 60 GB local disk, and 3000 IOPS.
