== Infrastructure topology
The following diagram outlines the infrastructure topology that Red{nbsp}Hat has tested with this deployment model that customers can use when self-managing {PlatformNameShort}:

.Infrastructure topology diagram
image::rpm-b-env-a.png[RPM {EnterpriseTopology} diagram]

Each virtual machine (VM) has been tested with the following component requirements: 16 GB RAM, 4 CPUs, 60 GB local disk, and 3000 IOPS.

[options="header"]
|====
| VM count | Purpose | Example VM group names
| 2 | {GatewayStart} with colocated Redis | `automationgateway` 
| 2 | {ControllerNameStart} | `automationcontroller`
| 2 | {PrivateHubNameStart} with colocated Redis | `automationhub`
| 2 | {EDAName} with colocated Redis | `automationedacontroller`
| 1 | {AutomationMeshStart} hop node | `execution_nodes`
| 2 | {AutomationMeshStart} execution node | `execution_nodes`
| 1 | Externally managed database service | N/A
| 1 | HAProxy load balancer in front of {Gateway} (externally managed) | N/A
|====

[NOTE]
====
6 VMs are required for a Redis high availability (HA) compatible deployment. Redis can be colocated on each {PlatformNameShort} component VM except for {ControllerName}, execution nodes, or the PostgreSQL database.

| Type | Description 
| Subscription | Valid {PlatformName} subscription
| Operating system 
a| 
* {RHEL} 8.8 or later minor versions of {RHEL} 8.

== Network ports

{PlatformName} uses several ports to communicate with its services. These ports must be open and available for incoming connections to the {PlatformName} server for it to work. Ensure that these ports are available and are not blocked by the server firewall.
