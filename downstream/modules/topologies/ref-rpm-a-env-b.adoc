= RPM mixed growth topology

The growth topology is intended for organizations that are getting started with {PlatformNameShort} and do not require redundancy or higher compute for large volumes of automation. This topology allows for smaller footprint deployments. The mixed topology has different versions of {PlatformNameShort} intended for configuring a new installation of {EDAcontroller} 1.1 with {ControllerName} 4.4 or 4.5.

== Infrastructure topology
The following diagram outlines the infrastructure topology that Red{nbsp}Hat has tested with this deployment model that customers can use when self-managing {PlatformNameShort}:

Each virtual machine (VM) has been tested with the following component requirements: 16 GB RAM, 4 CPUs, 60 GB local disk, and 3000 IOPS.

== Tested system configurations

Red{nbsp}Hat has tested the following configurations to install and run {PlatformName}:

.Tested system configurations
[options="header"]
|====
| Type | Description 
| Subscription | Valid {PlatformName} subscription
| Operating system | {RHEL} 8.8 or later, or {RHEL} 9.2 or later
| CPU architecture | x86_64, AArch64
| Ansible-core | Ansible-core version {CoreInstVers} or later
| Browser | A currently supported version of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome
| Database | {PostgresVers}
|====

== Network ports

{PlatformName} uses several ports to communicate with its services. These ports must be open and available for incoming connections to the {PlatformName} server for it to work. Ensure that these ports are available and are not blocked by the server firewall.
