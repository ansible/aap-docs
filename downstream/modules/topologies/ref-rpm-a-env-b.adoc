== Infrastructure topology
The following diagram outlines the infrastructure topology that Red{nbsp}Hat has tested with this deployment model that customers can use when self-managing {PlatformNameShort}:

.Infrastructure topology diagram

[NOTE]
====
Here, {ControllerName} and {HubName} are at 2.4x while the {EDAName} and {Gateway} components are at {PlatformVers}
====

Each virtual machine (VM) has been tested with the following component requirements: 16 GB RAM, 4 CPUs, 60 GB local disk, and 3000 IOPS.

== Tested system configurations

Red{nbsp}Hat has tested the following configurations to install and run {PlatformName}:

.Tested system configurations
[options="header"]
|====
| Type | Description 
| Subscription | Valid {PlatformName} subscription
| Operating system 
a| 
* {RHEL} 8.8 or later minor versions of {RHEL} 8. 
* {RHEL} 9.2 or later minor versions of {RHEL} 9.
| CPU architecture | x86_64, AArch64
| Ansible-core | Ansible-core version {CoreInstVers} or later

== Network ports

{PlatformName} uses several ports to communicate with its services. These ports must be open and available for incoming connections to the {PlatformName} server for it to work. Ensure that these ports are available and are not blocked by the server firewall.
