= Building {ExecEnvShort}s with environment variables for Galaxy configuration

[role="_abstract"]
{Builder} schema 3 enables you to perform complex scenarios such as specifying custom Galaxy configurations. 

You can use this approach to pass sensitive information, such as authentication tokens, into the {ExecEnvShort} build without leaking them into the final execution environment image.

The following example uses {Galaxy} Server environment variables.

additional_build_steps:
  prepend_galaxy:
    # Environment variables used for Galaxy client configurations
    - ENV ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_LIST=automation_hub
    - ENV ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_AUTOMATION_HUB_URL=https://console.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/content/xxxxxxx-synclist/
    - ENV ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_AUTOMATION_HUB_AUTH_URL=https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token
    # define a custom build arg env passthru - we still also have to pass
    # `--build-arg ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_AUTOMATION_HUB_TOKEN` to get it to pick it up from the env
    - ARG ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_AUTOMATION_HUB_TOKEN

options:
  package_manager_path: /usr/bin/microdnf  # downstream images use non-standard package manager

You can provide environment variables such as `ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_LIST`, `ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_AUTOMATION_HUB_URL` and `ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_AUTOMATION_HUB_AUTH_URL` using the `ENV` directive. 
//Commenting out as no downstream alternative [AAP-57435]
//For more information, see the link:https://docs.ansible.com/projects/ansible/latest/galaxy/user_guide.html#configuring-the-ansible-galaxy-client[Galaxy User Guide] in the Ansible documentation.

For security reasons, you must not store sensitive information in `ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_AUTOMATION_HUB_TOKEN`. 
You can use the ARG directive to receive sensitive information from the user as input.

`–build-args` can be used to provide this information while invoking the ansible-builder command.
