[role="_abstract"]
The `python` entry in the definition file points to a valid requirements file or to an inline list of Python requirements in link:https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/builder/en/latest/porting_guides/porting_guide_v3.1/#pep-508-standard[PEP508] format for the `pip install -r ...` command.

The entry `requirements.txt` is a file that installs extra Python requirements on top of what the Collections already list as their Python dependencies. 
It might be listed as a relative path from the directory of the {ExecEnvNameSing} definition's folder, or an absolute path. The contents of a `requirements.txt` file should be formatted as the following example, similar to the standard output from a `pip freeze` command.

The content might look like the following:
