= Building the {ExecEnvNameSing} image

After you create a definition file, you can proceed to build an {ExecEnvNameSing} image.

.Prerequisites
* You have created a definition file.

.Procedure
To build an {ExecEnvNameSing} image, run the following from the command line:
----
$ ansible-builder build
----

By default, {Builder} looks for a definition file named `execution-environment.yml` but a different file path can be specified as an argument with the `-f` flag:
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ ansible-builder build -f _definition-file-name_.yml
----

where _definition-file-name_ specifies the name of your definition file.
