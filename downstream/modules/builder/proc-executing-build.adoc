= Building the {ExecEnvNameSing} image

[role="_abstract"]
When you have created a definition file, you can proceed to build an {ExecEnvNameSing} image.

[NOTE]
====
When building an {ExecEnvShort} image, it must support the architecture that {PlatformNameShort} is deployed with.
====

.Prerequisites
* You have created a definition file.

.Procedure

. To build an {ExecEnvNameSing} image, run the following from the command line:
+
----
$ ansible-builder build
----
+
By default, {Builder} looks for a definition file named `execution-environment.yml` but a different file path can be specified as an argument with the `-f` flag:
+
For example:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ ansible-builder build -f _definition-file-name_.yml
----
+
where _definition-file-name_ specifies the name of your definition file.
