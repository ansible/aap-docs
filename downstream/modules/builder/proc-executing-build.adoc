= Building the {ExecEnvNameSing} image

After you create a definition file, you can proceed to build an {ExecEnvNameSing} image.

[NOTE]
====
When building an {ExecEnvShort} image, it must support the architecture that {PlatformNameShort} is deployed with.
====

.Prerequisites
* You have created a definition file.

.Procedure
To build an {ExecEnvNameSing} image, run the following from the command line:
----
$ ansible-builder build
----

By default, {Builder} looks for a definition file named `execution-environment.yml` or `execution-environment.yaml`,
but you can specify a different file path with the `-f` or `--file` flag:
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ ansible-builder build -f <_definition-file-name_>.yml
----

Replace <_`definition-file-name`_> with the name of your definition file.
