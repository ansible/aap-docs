= Suitable prompts for the GitHub MCP server

[role="_abstract"]
When using the GitHub MCP server, certain prompts can help you get the most out of your interactions with GitHub repositories. Here are some suitable prompts to consider:

Deploy an execution environment with the GitHub MCP server to automate GitHub operations through Ansible playbooks for:

* *Repository Management*: Browse and query code, search files, analyze commits, and understand project structure across any repository you have access to.
* *Issue and PR Automation*: Create, update, and manage issues and pull requests. Let AI help triage bugs, review code changes, and maintain project boards.
* *CI/CD and Workflow Intelligence*: Monitor GitHub Actions workflow runs, analyze build failures, manage releases, and get insights into your development pipeline.
* *Code Analysis*: Examine security findings, review Dependabot alerts, understand code patterns, and get comprehensive insights into your codebase.
* *Team Collaboration*: Access discussions, manage notifications, analyze team activity, and streamline processes for your team.

To run the playbook locally with the EE, use:

`ansible-navigator run github-playbook.yml --eei localhost/my-mcp-ee:latest --ce podman --pp never -m stdout'

The GitHub MCP server requires a GitHub token for authentication, which should be set in the `MCP_BEARER_TOKEN` environment variable and can be passed as a parameter when invoking the MCP server modules.
