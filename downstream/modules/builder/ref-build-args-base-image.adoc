= Build arguments

The `build_arg_defaults` section of the definition file is a dictionary whose keys can provide default values for arguments to {Builder}. 

The following table lists values that can be used in `build_arg_defaults`:

[cols="a,a"]
|===
| Value | Description

| `ANSIBLE_GALAXY_CLI_COLLECTION_OPTS` | Enables the user to pass arbitrary arguments to the ansible-galaxy CLI during the collection installation phase. 

For example, the `–pre` flag to enable the installation of pre-release collections, or `-c` to disable verification of the server's SSL certificate.

| `ANSIBLE_GALAXY_CLI_ROLE_OPTS` | Enables the user to pass any flags, such as `–no-deps`, to the role installation.

[NOTE]
====
It is generally easier (especially in a pipeline context) to customize the base image into a custom base image using podman first, and then call `ansible-builder` on this custom image.
====

The values given inside `build_arg_defaults` will be hard-coded into the `Containerfile`, so these values will persist if `podman build` is called manually.

[NOTE]
====
If the same variable is specified in the CLI `--build-arg` flag, the CLI value takes higher precedence.
