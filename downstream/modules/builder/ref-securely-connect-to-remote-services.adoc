= Securely connecting to remote services

[role="_abstract"]
The MCP architecture supports both local process execution and remote connections.

* *Remote HTTP Connections*: To connect to a remote, hosted MCP server through HTTP, use the `{role_name}_mode` variable and set it to remote. To change the accessed URL, provide it using the `{role_name}_registry.path` variable.

Currently, only the github_mcp_server role supports this.
* *Authentication Tokens*: When running a server that requires authentication (such as the GitHub MCP server), pass credentials as environment variables in your automation job configuration.
