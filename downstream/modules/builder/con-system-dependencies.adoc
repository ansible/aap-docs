= System

[role="_abstract"]
The `system` entry in the definition points to a link:https://docs.opendev.org/opendev/bindep/latest/readme.html[bindep] requirements file or to an inline list of bindep entries, which install system-level dependencies that are outside of what the collections already include as their dependencies. 

The `system` entry can be listed as a relative path from the directory of the {ExecEnvNameSing} definition's folder, or as an absolute path. 
At a minimum, the the collections must specify necessary requirements for `[platform:rpm]`.

To demonstrate this, the following is an example `bindep.txt` file that adds the `libxml2` and `subversion` packages to a container.

The content might look like the following:

----
libxml2-devel [platform:rpm]
subversion [platform:rpm]
----

Entries from multiple collections are combined into a single file. This is processed by `bindep` and then passed to `dnf`. Only requirements with no profiles or no runtime requirements will be installed to the image.
