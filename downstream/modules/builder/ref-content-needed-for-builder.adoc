[id="ref-content-needed-for-builder"]

= Content needed for an execution environment 

Ansible-builder is used to create an {ExecEnvShort}.

An {ExecEnvShort} must contain:

* Ansible
* Ansible Runner
* Ansible Collections
* Python and system dependencies of:
** modules or plugins in collections
** content in ansible-base
**custom user needs

Building a new {ExecEnvShort} involves a definition that specifies which content you want to include in your {ExecEnvShort}, such as collections, Python requirements, and system-level packages. 
The definition must be a `.yml` file
The content from the output generated from migrating to {ExecEnvShort}s has some of the required data that can be piped to a file or pasted into this definition file.
