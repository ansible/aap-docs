= Example YAML file to build an image 

The 'ansible-builder' build command takes an {ExecEnvShort} definition as an input. 
It outputs the build context necessary for building an {ExecEnvShort} image, and then builds that image. 
The image can be re-built with the build context elsewhere, and produces the same result. 
By default, the builder searches for a file named `execution-environment.yml` in the current directory.
The following example `execution-environment.yml` file can be used as a starting point:

----
version: 3
dependencies:
  galaxy: requirements.yml
The content of requirements.yml:
---
collections:
  - name: awx.awx
To build an execution environment using the preceding files and run the following command:
ansible-builder build
...
STEP 7: COMMIT my-awx-ee

09c930f5f6ac329b7ddb321b144a029dbbfcc83bdfc77103968b7f6cdfc7bea2
Complete! The build context can be found at: context
----

In addition to producing a ready-to-use container image, the build context is preserved. 
This can be rebuilt at a different time or location with the tools of your choice, such as docker build or podman build.
