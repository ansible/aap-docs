= GitHub MCP server

[role="_abstract"]
The GitHub MCP Server connects AI tools directly to GitHub's platform. This gives AI agents, assistants, and chatbots the ability to read repositories and code files, manage issues and PRs, analyze code, and automate workflows.

The remote GitHub MCP Server is hosted by GitHub and provides the easiest method for getting up and running. You can use the local version of the GitHub MCP Server instead.
