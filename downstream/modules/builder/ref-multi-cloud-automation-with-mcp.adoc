= Multi-cloud automation with MCP servers

[role="_abstract"]
Combine multiple MCP servers for comprehensive cloud and version control automation. For example, deploy an {ExecEnvShort} with GitHub MCP (Go binary or remotely hosted), Azure MCP (npm package), and AWS Core MCP (PyPI package) to manage resources across different platforms from a single Ansible workflow.

*Example prompts* 

Create a deployment pipeline that:

* Performs operations using the AWS Core MCP server's available proxy servers.
* Configures Azure resources using the Azure MCP server.
* Updates GitHub repository settings and creates deployment issues using the GitHub MCP server.
+
All of these operations can be orchestrated from a single Ansible playbook running in your custom {ExecEnvShort}.
