= Build {ExecEnvShort}s with environment variables

[role="_abstract"]
The following example file specifies environment variables that might be required for the build process. 

To achieve this functionality it uses the `ENV` variable definition in the `prepend_base` step of the additional_build_steps section.

[example]
====
----
-
additional_build_steps:
  prepend_base:
    - ENV FOO=bar
    - RUN echo $FOO > /tmp/file1.txt
----
====
The same environment variables can be used in the later stage of the build process.
