= Updating the {HubName} CA certificate


[role="_abstract"]
Use this example to customize the default definition file to include a CA certificate to the `additional-build-files` section, move the file to the appropriate directory and, finally, run the command to update the dynamic configuration of CA certificates to allow the system to trust this CA certificate.

.Prerequisites
* A custom CA certificate, for example `rootCA.crt`.

[NOTE]
====
Customizing the CA certificate using `prepend_base` means that the resulting CA configuration appears in all other build stages and the final image, because all other build stages inherit from the base image.

-----
additional_build_files:
  # copy the CA public key into the build context, we will copy and use it in the base image later
  - src: files/rootCA.crt
    dest: configs

additional_build_steps:
  prepend_base:
    # copy a custom CA cert into the base image and recompute the trust database
    # because this is in "base", all stages will inherit (including the final EE)
    - COPY _build/configs/rootCA.crt /usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/anchors
    - RUN update-ca-trust

options:
  package_manager_path: /usr/bin/microdnf  # downstream images use non-standard package manager
