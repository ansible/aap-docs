= Additional custom build steps

You can specify custom build commands for any build phase in the `additional_build_steps` section of the definition file. 
This allows fine-grained control over the build phases.

Use the `prepend_` and `append_` commands to add directives to the `Containerfile` that run either before or after the main build steps are executed. 
The commands must conform to any rules required for the runtime system.

See the following table for a list of values that can be used in `additional_build_steps`:

[cols="a,a"]
|===
| Value | Description

| `prepend_base` | Allows you to insert commands before building the base image.

| `append_base` | Allows you to insert commands after building the base image.

| `prepend_galaxy` | Allows you to insert before building the galaxy image.

| `append_galaxy` | Allows you to insert after building the galaxy image.

| `prepend_builder` | Allows you to insert commands before building the Python builder image.

| `append_builder` | Allows you to insert commands after building the Python builder image.

| `prepend_final` | Allows you to insert before building the final image.

| `append_final` | Allows you to insert after building the final image.

|===

The syntax for `additional_build_steps` supports both multi-line strings and lists. 
See the following examples:

.A multi-line string entry
[example]
====
----
prepend_final: |
   RUN whoami
   RUN cat /etc/os-release
----
====

.A list entry
[example]
====
----
append_final:
- RUN echo This is a post-install command!
- RUN ls -la /etc

== Copying arbitrary files to {ExecEnvShort}s

{Builder} version 3 schema provides the option to copy files to an execution environment image. 
The following example file copies arbitrary files to an execution environment.

[example]
====
----
additional_build_files:
  # copy arbitrary files next to this EE def into the build context - we can refer to them later...
  - src: files/rootCA.crt
    dest: configs

additional_build_steps:
  prepend_base:
    # copy a custom CA cert into the base image and recompute the trust database
    # because this is in "base", all stages will inherit (including the final EE)
    - COPY _build/configs/rootCA.crt /usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/anchors
    - RUN update-ca-trust
----
====
The `additional_build_files` section enable you to add `rootCA.crt` to the build context directory. 
When this file is copied to the build context directory, it can be used in the build process. 
To use the file, copy it from the build context directory using the COPY directive specified in the prepend_base step of the additional_build_steps section.
You can perform any action based upon the copied file, such as in this example updating dynamic configuration of CA certificates by running RUN update-ca-trust.


== Building {ExecEnvShort}s with environment variables

{Builder} version 3 schema provides the option to specify environment variables that can be used in the build process.
The following example file specifies environment variables that might be required for the build process. 
To achieve this functionality it uses the `ENV` variable definition in the `prepend_base` step of the additional_build_steps section.

[example]
====
----
—
additional_build_steps:
  prepend_base:
    - ENV FOO=bar
    - RUN echo $FOO > /tmp/file1.txt
----
====
The same environment variables can be used in the later stage of the build process.

.Building {ExecEnvShort}s with environment variables for Galaxy configuration

{Builder} schema 3 enables you to perform complex scenarios such as specifying custom Galaxy configurations. 
You can use this approach to pass sensitive information, such as authentication tokens, into the {ExecEnvShort} build without leaking them into the final execution environment image.

The following example uses {Galaxy} Server environment variables.

[example]
====
----
additional_build_steps:
  prepend_galaxy:
    # Environment variables used for Galaxy client configurations
    - ENV ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_LIST=automation_hub
    - ENV ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_AUTOMATION_HUB_URL=https://console.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/content/xxxxxxx-synclist/
    - ENV ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_AUTOMATION_HUB_AUTH_URL=https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token
    # define a custom build arg env passthru - we still also have to pass
    # `--build-arg ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_AUTOMATION_HUB_TOKEN` to get it to pick it up from the env
    - ARG ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_AUTOMATION_HUB_TOKEN

options:
  package_manager_path: /usr/bin/microdnf  # downstream images use non-standard package manager
----
====

You can provide environment variables such as `ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_LIST `, `ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_AUTOMATION_HUB_URL` and `ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_AUTOMATION_HUB_AUTH_URL` using the `ENV` directive. For more information, see the link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/galaxy/user_guide.html#configuring-the-ansible-galaxy-client[Galaxy User Guide] in the Ansible documentation.

For security reasons, you must not store sensitive information in `ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_AUTOMATION_HUB_TOKEN`. 
You can use the ARG directive to receive sensitive information from the user as input.

`–build-args` can be used to provide this information while invoking the ansible-builder command.
