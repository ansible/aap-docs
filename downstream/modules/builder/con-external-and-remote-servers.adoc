= External and remote MCP server connection

[role="_abstract"]
When building an {ExecEnvShort} with MCP servers, you can choose to include external or remote servers instead of embedding them directly into the environment.

The MCP architecture supports connecting to a remote, hosted MCP server through HTTP. To configure a remote connection, you must set the role-specific variable `<role_name>_mode` to remote.

The accessed URL for the remote server can be changed by providing it through the `<role_name>_registry.path` variable.
