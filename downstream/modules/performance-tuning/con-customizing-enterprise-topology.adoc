= Motivations for customizing {EnterpriseTopologyPlural}

[role="_abstract"]
Enterprise topologies provide a pattern for scalability and resilience.
Organizations typically evolve the tested deployment models into custom deployments, tailoring service configurations and scaling to their specific workflows and performance needs within {PlatformName}.

An organization's unique use of {PlatformNameShort} determines which components require scaling, moving from a generic {EnterpriseTopology} to a workload-tuned deployment.

Workloads such as infrequent {HubName} use or API-heavy integrations necessitate different scaling priorities.
This includes components such as the API service or execution plane.

Motivations for customizing the documented enterprise deployment models include the following:

* Achieving high availability
* Enabling independent scaling of components, such as {ControllerName} API compared to execution capacity
* Supporting workload growth or specific SLAs

This requires custom resource allocation and performance tuning based on identified needs, rather than adherence to a general pattern.

Before customizing and scaling, you must identify specific bottlenecks within your {PlatformNameShort} environment, such as:

* API response
* Job processing
* Database performance
* {EDAName} event handling.

Use platform monitoring tools and analytics to identify bottlenecks.
After bottlenecks are identified, you can approach scaling each component vertically or horizontally.
