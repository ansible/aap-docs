= Considerations for scaling the {EDAName} APIs

[role="_abstract"]
Scaling {EDAName} involves considerations for each of its service types:

* API and WebSocket service
* EventStream service

API requests routed to `/api/eda` and `/api/eda-event-stream` are handled by two separate `Gunicorn` deployments.
In {OCPShort}, these services must be scaled independently.
For {VMBase} and {ContainerBase}, you can scale these services together by increasing the number of hybrid nodes.

== {EDAName} API and WebSocket service

The {EDAName} API service handles `HTTP` requests to the application, including information about user roles in {EDAName}, creating projects, creating activations, and checking results.
Key performance indicators for the API service include the following:

* High API latency for requests under `/api/eda`
* High CPU utilization on the API pods/nodes
* {GatewayStart} returning `503` errors because the service is too busy to respond to health checks

A WebSocket service is deployed alongside the API service to manage the output of the rulebook activations.
Each activation maintains a persistent WebSocket connection to this service to communicate status and receive instructions.
A large number of activations or a large amount of output from activations can overwhelm the WebSocket server, leading to failures.

Consider the following strategies to scale the {EDAName} API and WebSocket service:

* {OCPShort}: The WebSocket server (Daphne) runs within the `eda-api` pod.
Horizontally scale the `eda-api` deployment to scale this service.
[NOTE]
====
Ensure that you scale the `eda-api` deployment in proportion to the number of activations being run.
====
* {VMBase} or {ContainerBase}: Horizontally scale the WebSocket service alongside the API service by adding more hybrid nodes.
This increases capacity for all {EDAName} components simultaneously.

To identify whether your deployment experienced a bottleneck in the WebSocket service, check the activation logs for the following errors:

[source]
----
ansible_rulebook.websocket - WARNING - websocket aborted by <class 'websockets.exceptions.InvalidMessage'>: did not receive a valid HTTP response
ansible_rulebook.cli - ERROR - Terminating: did not receive a valid HTTP response
----

== {EDAName} EventStream service

The Event Stream API, which handles POST requests to `/api/eda-event-stream`, is a separate `Gunicorn` service designed to ingest events from external sources.
If this service's performance degrades, with high latency, low throughput, or availability issues, you must scale it.
The {Gateway} returns `503` errors for this service when a pod is too busy to respond to health checks in time.

Consider the following strategies to scale the {EDAName} EventStream service:

* {OCPShort}: Horizontally scale up the dedicated `eda-event-stream` worker deployment, because it is managed separately from the main `eda-api deployment`.
* {VMBase} or {ContainerBase}: Horizontally scale up this service by adding more hybrid nodes, which increases capacity for all {EDAName} components simultaneously.
