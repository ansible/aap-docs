= Scaling and management considerations by installer type

[role="_abstract"]
Considerations for scaling and managing each {PlatformNameShort} component differ based on the installer type.
The following table provides information on scaling and management operations for each installer type, as well as other common operations to consider when planning your deployment:

[NOTE]
====
{OCP}-based deployments provide the most flexibility and customizability, which enables you to adapt the deployment as needs change.
{OCPShort} also provides fine-grained observability through its built-in metrics capabilities and integrations, with log aggregation tools that capture all logs from all pods in the {PlatformNameShort} deployment.

|Containerized Deployments (Podman based)

|Horizontally scale up
|Scale control, execution, {HubName}, and {EDAName} components independently by adjusting replicas. Expanding total capacity by adding worker nodes to {OCPShort} does not disrupt {PlatformNameShort} operation.
|Requires updating inventory file and re-running entire installation, which restarts and requires halting use of the platform.
|Requires updating inventory file and re-running entire installation, which restarts and requires halting use of the platform.

|Horizontally scale down
|Reduces replicas handled by operator. For scaling down {ControllerName} task pods, usage of `termination_grace_period_seconds` allows the scale down to occur after jobs are drained from the task pod.
|Requires updating the inventory file and re-running the entire installation. This restarts the platform, halting use.
|Requires updating the inventory file and re-running the entire installation. This restarts the platform, halting use.

|Vertically scaling up or down
|Increases or decreases requests and limits on individual deployment types. The operator deploys a new pod with these resources, and previous pods scale down. For {ControllerName} task pods, usage of `termination_grace_period_seconds allows` the old replicas to scale down after jobs are drained from task pods.
|Depending on your virtualization provider, the virtual machine may require shutdown to resize. Attaining the full benefit of vertical scaling requires re-running the installer, which restarts and halts use of the platform. Running the installer adapts any settings that were tuned based on the number of available cores and RAM.

|Installation
|Utilizes {OCPShort} Operators for automated deployment and management.
|Ansible Playbook-based installer installs RPMs and configures the platform.
|Ansible Playbook-based installer that configures platform services in podman containers, which are managed by `systemd`.

|Upgrade
|Handled by {OCPShort} Operators with automated rolling updates. Usage of `termination_grace_period_seconds` allows upgrades without downtime and without halting job execution.
|Requires running the installer and restarting services, which halts use of the platform.
|Requires running the installer and restarting services, which halts use of the platform.

|Aggregating Application Logs
|Centralized logging through {OCPShort}'s built-in logging stack or integrations with external aggregators.
|Requires external log aggregation solutions (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk) to collect logs from individual nodes.
|Requires external log aggregation solutions (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk) to collect logs from container instances.

|Monitoring Resource Utilization
|Comprehensive monitoring with {OCPShort}'s built-in Prometheus and Grafana dashboards, providing detailed pod and node metrics.
|Requires external monitoring tools to collect and visualize resource metrics from nodes.
