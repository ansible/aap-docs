= Considerations for scaling the {Gateway} proxy and authentication service

[role="_abstract"]
Scaling the {Gateway} proxy and authentication service may be appropriate if the volume of requests to proxy or authenticate exceeds existing {Gateway} service capabilities.
Horizontal scaling is preferred in this case, as vertical scaling does not automatically adjust all worker pool values for the gRPC, Envoy, Nginx, and WSGI services.

[NOTE]
====
Additional {Gateway} service pods or instances can increase the necessary database connections for WSGI web service workers and gRPC authentication service workers.
====

If you observe a bottleneck in CPU utilization, then scaling the gRPC authentication service can improve throughput.
However, if external authentication providers are the source of high latency, then horizontal scaling of the gRPC service has minimal benefits.
You can determine the gRPC authentication latency for requests by observing the difference between the upstream service time and the total request latency.

The most performant authentication methods are:

* Token authentication
* Session authentication
* Basic authentication must not be used for high-frequency API automation because CPU-intensive password hashing introduces significant request latency.
If basic authentication is used in combination with LDAP authentication, reaching out to the LDAP service can introduce significant latency, especially if the LDAP service has limited availability.
For this reason, we recommend creating OAuth Tokens to perform automation against the API.

Horizontally scaling the {Gateway} service pods also increases the number of health checks to each component’s API, because each Envoy tracks this separately.
You can observe these in logs with the user agent `Envoy/HC`.
Since health checks flow through the same services and queues as user-initiated requests, if overall request times slow due to overload, health checks can also timeout.
When this occurs, Envoy stops forwarding requests to these service nodes until they pass their health check again.

== Special considerations for scaling the {Gateway} proxy and authentication service on {OCPShort}

It is particularly important that the service is horizontally scaled sufficiently in {OCPShort}, because if more than 100 requests are backlogged, then these requests are then dropped by uWSGI.
This results in clients receiving a timeout for dropped requests.
The following log text provides the corresponding error for this event:

[source]
----
*** uWSGI listen queue of socket ":8000" (fd: 3) full !!! (101/100) ***
----

This error occurs due to a limitation of uWSGI tying its backlog length to the kernel parameter `somaxconn`.
It is possible to raise this kernel parameter in {OCPShort}, but doing so requires allowing “unsafe sysctls”.
