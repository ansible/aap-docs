= {EDAName} activations

[role="_abstract"]
Activations are used by {EDAName} to run instances of `ansible-rulebook`.
These activations can either connect to external event sources or listen to an event stream for incoming payloads.

Activation and output management uses {EDAName} hybrid nodes, the {Gateway} for event stream handling, the WebSocket server in each API node or pod, and the database for audit event storage.

Activations process discrete payloads called events.
The activation's resource usage is affected by the event arrival rate and the complexity of the rulebook's rules.
When events match rules, they trigger actions, which launch jobs in {ControllerName}.
Event auditing stores audit events in the database and is enabled by default.

Each event is sent from the activation to the websocket server to be serialized and written to the database.
This process stresses the server and can cause performance issues.
Selecting *Skip audit events* in the UI for a given activation eliminates this workload.
When *Skip audit events* is selected, rules are still fired, but the fire count in the API and UI is updated at a periodic interval (default 300 seconds) rather than immediately.
