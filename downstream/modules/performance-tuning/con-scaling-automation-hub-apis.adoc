= Considerations for scaling the {HubName} APIs

[role="_abstract"]
Scaling {HubName} involves considerations for each of its service types:

* API service: manages `HTTP` requests through the API
* Pulp workers service: manages syncs and content uploads
* Content service: manages content delivery after content has been processed and stored

Separate `Gunicorn` deployments back these services and handle different types of requests.
In {OCPShort}, these services must be scaled independently.
In {VMBase} and {ContainerBase}, a standard {HubName} node hosts all services, and scaling is achieved by adding more nodes.

== {HubNameStart} API service

The {HubName} API service handles metadata-driven requests for the application, including UI interactions, searches, and remote repository configuration.
Key performance indicators for the {HubName} API service include:

* High API latency for requests under `/api/galaxy`
* High CPU utilization on the API pods or nodes
* {GatewayStart} returning `503` errors because the service is too busy to respond to health checks

Consider the following strategies to scale the automaton {HubName} API service:

* {OCPShort}: Horizontally scale the API pods by increasing the `hub.api.replicas` attribute on the `AnsibleAutomationPlatform` Custom Resource (CR).
* {VMBase} or {ContainerBase}: Horizontally scale the API service by adding more {HubName} nodes, which simultaneously scales all other {HubName} services.

== {HubNameStart} Pulp worker and content services

The Pulp worker and content services manage all operations related to content syncs, uploads and downloads.
Key performance indicators for the Pulp worker and content services include:

* High Content sync rates: Frequent or large synchronization operations from external repositories demanding significant worker processing.
* High Content upload or download rates: Frequent pushing or pulling of {ExecEnvName} by {ControllerName}, {EDAName}, or large Collection uploads or downloads by automation clients.
* Disk I/O bottlenecks: Performance issues related to read/write operations on the underlying content storage (`/var/lib/pulp`), often shown as high disk I/O wait times.
* Pulp worker saturation: High CPU utilization or queuing within pulp processes, indicating an inability to keep up with content processing and serving.

To scale your Pulp worker and content services, consider the following scaling strategies:

* In {OCPShort}: Scale the deployment of these services by increasing the `hub.content.replicas` and `hub.worker.replicas` attributes on the `AnsibleAutomationPlatform` Custom Resource.
* For {VMBase} or {ContainerBase}: Horizontally scale all services by adding more {HubName} nodes.
