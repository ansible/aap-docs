= Horizontal scaling for performance

[role="_abstract"]
Horizontal scaling involves increasing the number of replicas (pods or virtual machines) for a given service.
Like vertical scaling, this approach is useful for high resource utilization or workload scaling.

== Benefits of horizontal scaling

* Improved availability: Distributes load across more instances to reduce the impact of a single slow or failing node.
* Redundancy: Provides extra capacity, allowing individual service nodes to recover or cool-off without impacting overall availability.
* Increased authentication capacity: Each {Gateway} pod includes its own authentication service, so scaling the {Gateway} directly increases the platform's authentication throughput.
* Repeatable scaling procedure: After the instance size and configuration are verified for your environment, deploy identical instances to scale.

== Drawbacks and other considerations for horizontal scaling

* Database limitations: Scaling the application increases the maximum potential number of database connections from worker processes, and the overall memory, I/O, and CPU utilization of the PostgreSQL instance.
As you scale past the tested deployment models, deploy your separate Postgres instances per component ({Gateway}, {EDAName}, {ControllerName}, {HubName}).
* Health Check Overhead: In a mesh architecture, each Envoy proxy sends health checks to every other cluster member.
Horizontal scaling increases this baseline traffic, adding to system overhead.
