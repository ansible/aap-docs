= Collection synchronization

[role="_abstract"]
{PrivateHubNameStart} can synchronize collections from remote `ansible-galaxy` repositories, such as `galaxy.ansible.com` or {HubName} on `console.redhat.com`.

Pulp content workers and the database synchronize the repositories.
The {ControllerName} can download these collections during project updates, or use them to build {ExecEnvName}.
Collections are also available for any other client by using the `ansible-galaxy` CLI to download and use.

The performance of collection synchronization is impacted by the following:

* The number of collections listed in the `requirements.yml`
* The number of versions synced
* The number of versions retained

Synchronization uses memory in direct proportion to the number of collections and versions synchronized.
Using a targeted `requirements.yml` with specific versions can limit this impact.

Hosting collections uses storage space.
Manage the storage space that collections use by specifying the retained number of versions on the repository.
