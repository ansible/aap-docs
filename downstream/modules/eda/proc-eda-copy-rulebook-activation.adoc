= Copying a rulebook activation

When setting up a new rulebook activation with field inputs that are similar one of your existing rulebook activations, you can use the *Copy rulebook activation* feature instead of manually entering input into each field. While setting up rulebook activations can be a lengthy process, the ability to copy the required fields from an existing activation saves time and, in some cases, reduces the possibility of human error.

.Procedure

. On the Rulebook Activations page, click the *More Actions* icon *{MoreActionsIcon}* on the row of the activation you want to copy. The More Actions list is displayed with three options:
** *Restart rulebook activation*
** *Copy rulebook activation*
** *Delete rulebook activation*
. Click btn:[Copy rulebook activation] in the upper right of the Details tab.
