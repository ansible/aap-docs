= Author event filters

[role="_abstract"]
You can create custom Python event filters to clean, normalize, or enrich incoming event data, ensuring it meets the format and quality required for rulebook condition evaluation.

The basic structure follows:

----
   # my_namespace.my_collection/extensions/eda/plugins/event_filter/my_filter.py
    def main(event: dict, arg1, arg2):
        # Process event data here
        return event
----

You can use this filter in a rulebook by adding it to the filters list in an event source:

----
  sources:
    - name: azure_service_bus
      ansible.eda.azure_service_bus:
        conn_str: "{{connection_str}}"
        queue_name: "{{queue_name}}"
      filters:
        - my_namespace.my_collection.my_filter:
            arg1: hello
            arg2: world
----
