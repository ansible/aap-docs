= Author event filters

Event filters are functions in a python module that perform transformations on the event data. 
They can remove, add, change, or move any data in the event data structure. 
Event filters take the event as the first argument and additional keyword arguments are provided by the configuration in the rulebook.

The basic structure follows:

----
   # my_namespace.my_collection/extensions/eda/plugins/event_filter/my_filter.py
    def main(event: dict, arg1, arg2):
        # Process event data here
        return event
----

You can use this filter in a rulebook by adding it to the filters list in an event source:

----
  sources:
    - name: azure_service_bus
      ansible.eda.azure_service_bus:
        conn_str: "{{connection_str}}"
        queue_name: "{{queue_name}}"
      filters:
        - my_namespace.my_collection.my_filter:
            arg1: hello
            arg2: world
