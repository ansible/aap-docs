= Setting up a rulebook activation

.Prerequisites
// [ddacosta] I'm not sure whether there will be an EDA specific dashboard in the gateway. Step 1 might need to change to something like "Log in to AAP".
* You are logged in to the {EDAcontroller} Dashboard as a Content Consumer.
* You have set up a project.
* You have set up a decision environment.
* You have set up an {ControllerName} token.

.Procedure
// [ddacosta] I'm not sure whether there will be an EDA specific dashboard in the gateway. Step 1 might need to change to something like "Log in to AAP".
. Navigate to the {EDAcontroller} Dashboard.
. From the navigation panel, select {MenuADRulebookActivations}.
. Insert the following:
+
Name:: Insert the name.
Description:: This field is optional.
Project:: Projects are a logical collection of rulebooks.
Rulebook:: Rulebooks are shown according to the project selected.
Decision environment:: Decision environments are a container image to run Ansible rulebooks.
+
[NOTE]
====
In {EDAcontroller}, you cannot customize the pull policy of the decision environment.
By default, it follows the behavior of the *always* policy.
Every time an activation is started, the system tries to pull the most recent version of the image.
====
Restart policy:: This is a policy to decide when to restart a rulebook.
*** Policies:
... Always: Restarts when a rulebook finishes
... Never: Never restarts a rulebook when it finishes
... On failure: Only restarts when it fails
Rulebook activation enabled?:: This automatically enables the rulebook activation to run.
Variables:: The variables for the rulebook are in a JSON/YAML format.
The content would be equivalent to the file passed through the `--vars` flag of ansible-rulebook command.

. Click btn:[Create rulebook activation].

Your rulebook activation is now created and can be managed on the *Rulebook Activations* page.

After saving the new rulebook activation, the rulebook activation's details page is displayed.
From there or the *Rulebook Activations* list view, you can edit or delete it.

[NOTE]
====
Occasionally, when a source plugin shuts down, it causes a rulebook to exit gracefully after a certain amount of time. When a rulebook activation shuts down, any tasks that are waiting to be performed will be canceled, and an info level message will be sent to the activation log. For more information, see link:https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/rulebook/en/stable/rulebooks.html#[Rulebooks].
