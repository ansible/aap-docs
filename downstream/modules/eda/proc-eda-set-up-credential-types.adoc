.Procedure

. From the navigation panel, select {MenuADCredentialType}.
. Click btn:[Create credential type].
. Insert the following:
+
Name:: Insert the name.
Description:: This field is optional.
. In the *Input Configuration* field, specify an input schema that defines a set of ordered fields for that type. The format can be in YAML or JSON:
+

. In the *Injector Configuration* field, enter environment variables or extra variables that specify the values a credential type can inject.
The format can be in YAML or JSON (see examples in the previous step).

{
    "extra_vars": {
      "some_extra_var": "{{ username }}:{{ password }}"
  }
}
----

. Click btn:[Create credential type].

Your newly created credential type is displayed in the list of credential types:

//[JMS] Replace image with EDA version

. Click the btn:[Edit credential type] image:leftpencil.png[Edit,15,15] icon to modify the credential type options.
+
[NOTE]
====
On the *Edit* page, you can modify the details or delete the credential.
If the *Delete* option is disabled, this means that the credential type is being used by a credential, and you must delete the credential type from all the credentials that use it before you can delete it. 
====

.Verification

* Verify that the newly created credential type can be selected from the *Credential Type* selection window when creating a new credential:
+
image:credential-types-new-listed-verify.png[Verify new credential type]
//[JMS] Replace this image with up to date one, maybe?
