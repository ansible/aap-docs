= Copying a credential

When setting up a new credential that requires similar field inputs as your existing credentials, you can use the *Copy credential* feature in the Details tab to copy required field selections and input. While setting up credentials can be a lengthy process, the ability to duplicate those required fields saves time and, in some cases, eliminates the possibility of errors.

.Procedure

. Click btn:[Copy credential] button at the top of the Details tab. A message is displayed confirming that your selected credential has been copied: "<Name of credential> copied."
. Click the btn:[Back to credentials] tab and select the credential you just copied.

The credential you copied is displayed with the same name as the credential you copied with a time stamp in 24-hour format.
