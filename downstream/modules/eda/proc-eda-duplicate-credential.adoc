= Duplicating a credential

[role="_abstract"]
When setting up a new credential with field inputs that are similar to your existing credentials, you can use the *Duplicate credential* feature in the Details tab to duplicate information instead of manually entering it. While setting up credentials can be a lengthy process, the ability to duplicate the required fields from an existing credential saves time and, in some cases, reduces the possibility of human error.

.Procedure

. On the Credentials list page, click the name of the credential that you want to duplicate. This takes you to the *Details* tab of the credential.
. Click btn:[Duplicate credential] in the top right of the Details tab.

[NOTE]
====
You can also click the btn:[Duplicate credential] icon next to the desired credential on the Credentials list page.
====
A message is displayed confirming that your selected credential has been duplicated: "<Name of credential> duplicated." 
. Click the btn:[Back to credentials] tab to view the credential you just duplicated. 
+
The duplicated credential is displayed with the same name as the original credential followed by a time stamp in 24-hour format (for example, *<Name of credential> @ 17:26:30*). 
. Edit the details you prefer for your duplicated credential.
. Click btn:[Save credential].
