= Copying a credential

When setting up a new credential with field inputs that are similar to your existing credentials, you can use the *Copy credential* feature in the Details tab to duplicate information instead of manually entering it. While setting up credentials can be a lengthy process, the ability to copy the required fields from an existing credential saves time and, in some cases, reduces the possibility of human error.

.Procedure

. On the Credentials list page, click the name of the credential that you want to copy. This takes you to the *Details* tab of the credential.
. Click btn:[Copy credential] in the upper right of the Details tab.

The copied credential is displayed with the same name as the original credential followed by a time stamp in 24-hour format (for example, *<Name of credential> @ 17:26:30*). 
. Edit the details you prefer for your copied credential.
. Click btn:[Save credential].
