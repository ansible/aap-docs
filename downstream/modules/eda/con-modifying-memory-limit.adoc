=  Modifying the default memory limit for each rulebook activation

[role="_abstract"]
Memory usage is based on the number of events that {EDAcontroller} has to process.
Each rulebook activation container has a 200MB memory limit.
For example, with 4 CPU and 16GB of RAM, one rulebook activation container with an assigned 200MB memory limit can not handle more than 150,000 events per minute.
If the number of parallel running rulebook activations is higher, then the maximum number of events each rulebook activation can process is reduced.
If there are too many incoming events at a very high rate, the container can run out of memory trying to process the events.
This will kill the container, and your rulebook activation will fail with a status code of 137. 

To address this failure, you can increase the amount of memory allocated to rulebook activations in order to process a high number of events at a high rate by using one of the following procedures:

* Modifying the default memory limit for each rulebook activation during installation
* Modifying the default memory limit for each rulebook activation after installation
