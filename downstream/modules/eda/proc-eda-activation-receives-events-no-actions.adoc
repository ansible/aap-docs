= Actions not triggering despite receiving events

[role="_abstract"]
If your rulebook activation is *Running* and successfully receiving events, but no actions are being executed, the issue is likely within the logic of your rulebook.

.Procedure

. *Check rule conditions:* Review the rulebook YAML to confirm that the conditions (the when statements) are accurately written and precisely match the structure and values of the incoming event payload.
. *Verify indentation and syntax:* Ensure all rulebook syntax and indentation are correct, as a simple error can prevent the rule engine from evaluating conditions.
. *Validate actions:* Confirm that the specified action is a recognized and correctly configured action (for example, `run_job_template` with the proper arguments).
