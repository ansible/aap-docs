= Supported event sources

[role="_abstract"]
Event sources are the foundation of {EDAName}, as they define where your rulebooks receive incoming signals. 

Selecting a compatible source is critical for successful deployment, as some are exclusive to the web-based {EDAcontroller} and others only work with the `ansible-rulebook` command-line interface (CLI).

The following list includes event sources currently supported for use directly within the web-based {EDAcontroller}:

* `alertmanager`
* `aws_cloudtrail`
* `aws_sqs_queue` 
* `azure_service_bus`
* `kafka`
* `pg_listener` 
* `webhook`
