= Supported event sources

Event sources are a fundamental component of {EDAName} because they determine where a rulebook can receive events from. The effectiveness of a rulebook activation depends on selecting an event source that is compatible with your automation environment. Certain event sources are designed for use with the web-based {EDAcontroller}, while others, due to their reliance on local host functionality, are exclusive to the `ansible-rulebook` command-line interface (CLI). Understanding this distinction is crucial for successful rulebook activations.

The following list includes currently supported event sources for use with the web-based {EDAcontroller}. You can decide which event sources provide the desired outcome for your rulebook activations.

* `alertmanager`
* `aws_cloudtrail`
* `aws_sqs_queue` 
* `azure_service_bus`
* `kafka`
* `pg_listener` 
* `webhook`
