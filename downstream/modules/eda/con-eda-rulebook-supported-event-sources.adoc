= Supported event sources

Event sources are a fundamental component of {EDAName} because they determine where a rulebook can receive events from. The effectiveness of a rulebook activation depends on selecting an event source that is compatible with your automation environment. Certain event sources are designed for use with the web-based Event-Driven Ansible controller, while others, due to their reliance on local host functionality, are exclusive to the `ansible-rulebook`command-line interface (CLI). Understanding this distinction is crucial for successful rulebook activations.
