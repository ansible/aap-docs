= Modifying the number of simultaneous rulebook activations 

[role="_abstract"]
By default, {EDAcontroller} allows 12 rulebook activations per node. For example, with two worker or hybrid nodes, it results in a limit of 24 activations in total to run simultaneously.
If more than 24 rulebook activations are created, the expected behavior is that subsequent rulebook activations wait until there is an available rulebook activation worker.
In this case, the rulebook activation status is displayed as *Pending* even if there is enough free memory and CPU on your {EDAcontroller} instance.
To change this behavior, you must change the default maximum number of running rulebook activations.

[NOTE]
====
* The value for `MAX_RUNNING_ACTIVATIONS` does not change when you modify the instance size, so it needs to be adjusted manually.
* If you are installing {EDAName} on {OCPShort}, the 12 rulebook activations per node is a global limit for the application since there is no concept of worker or hybrid nodes in {OCPShort}.
