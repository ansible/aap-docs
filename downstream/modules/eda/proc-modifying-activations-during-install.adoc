= Modifying the number of simultaneous rulebook activations during {EDAcontroller} installation 

[role="_abstract"]
By default, {EDAcontroller} allows 12 rulebook activations per node. For example, with two worker or hybrid nodes, it results in a limit of 24 activations in total to run simultaneously. You can modify this default value during installation by using the following procedure:

.Procedure
Provide a variable to the VM installer:

. Navigate to the setup inventory file. 
. Add `automationedacontroller_max_running_activations` in the [all:vars] section.
For example, `automationedacontroller_max_running_activations=16`.
. Run the setup.
