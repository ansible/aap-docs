= Projects list view

[role="_abstract"]
The Projects list view provides a quick dashboard to verify rulebook sync status, track content via the Git hash, and manage repository access.

[NOTE]
====
If a rulebook changes in source control, you can re-sync a project by selecting the sync icon next to the project from the *Projects* list view. 
The *Git hash* updates represent the latest commit on that repository. 
An activation must be restarted or recreated if you want to use the updated project.
