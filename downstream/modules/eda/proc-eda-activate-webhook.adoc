= Activate webhook-based automation in Openshift

[role="_abstract"]
In Openshift environments, you can activate webhooks by creating a route to expose the activation's service, enabling external systems to send events and trigger automation.

.Prerequisites

* You have created a rulebook activation.

[NOTE]
====
The following is an example of rulebook with a given webhook:
-----
- name: Listen for storage-monitor events
  hosts: all
  sources:
    - ansible.eda.webhook:
        host: 0.0.0.0
        port: 5000
  rules:
    - name: Rule - Print event information
    condition: event.meta.headers is defined
    action:
      run_job_template:
        name: StorageRemediation
        organization: Default
        job_args:
          extra_vars:
             message: from eda
             sleep: 1
-----
====

.Procedure

. Create a Route (on {OCPShort}) to expose the service. 
The following is an example Route for an ansible-rulebook source that expects POST's on port 5000 on the decision environment pod:
+
-----
kind: Route
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
  name: test-sync-bug
  namespace: dynatrace
  labels:
    app: eda
    job-name: activation-job-1-5000
spec:
  host: test-sync-bug-dynatrace.apps.aap-dt.ocp4.testing.ansible.com
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: activation-job-1-5000
    weight: 100
  port:
    targetPort: 5000
  tls:
    termination: edge
    insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect
  wildcardPolicy: None 
-----
+
. When you create the Route, test it with a *Post to the Route URL*:
+
[NOTE]
====
You do not need the port as it is specified on the Route (targetPort).

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST 
test-sync-bug-dynatrace.apps.aap-dt.ocp4.testing.ansible.com -d
