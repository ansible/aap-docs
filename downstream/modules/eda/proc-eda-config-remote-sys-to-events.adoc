= Configuring your remote system to send events

After you have created your event stream, you must configure your remote system to send events to {EDAcontroller}. The method used for this configuration varies, depending on the vendor for the event stream credential type you select.

.Prerequisites

* The URL that was generated when you created your event stream
* Secrets or passwords that you set up in your event stream credential

.Procedure

The following example demonstrates how to configure webhooks in a remote system like GitHub to send events to {EDAcontroller}. Each vendor will have unique methods for configuring your remote system to send events to {EDAcontroller}.

. Log in to your GitHub repository.
. Click *Your profile name â†’ Your repositories*.

[NOTE]
====
If you do not have a repository, click *New* to create a new one, select an owner, add a *Repository name*, and click *Create repository*.
====

. Navigate to *Settings* (tool bar).
. In the *General* navigation pane, select *Webhooks*.
. Click *Add webhook*.
. In the *Payload URL* field, paste the URL you saved when you created your event stream.
. Select *application/json* in the *Content type* list.
. Enter your *Secret*.
. Click *Add webhook*.

After the webhook has been added, it attempts to send a test payload to ensure there is connectivity between the two systems (GitHub and {EDAcontroller}). If it can successfully send the data you will see a green check mark next to the *Webhook URL* with the message, *Last delivery was successful*.
