= Setting up a new project

You can set up projects to manage and store your rulebooks in {EDAcontroller}. 

.Prerequisites
// [ddacosta] I'm not sure whether there will be an EDA specific dashboard in the gateway. Step 1 might need to change to something like "Log in to AAP".
* You are logged in to the {PlatformNameShort} Dashboard as a Content Consumer.
* You have set up a credential, if necessary.
For more information, see the xref:eda-set-up-credential[Setting up credentials] section.
* You have an existing repository containing rulebooks that are integrated with playbooks contained in a repository to be used by {ControllerName}.

.Procedure

====
This field accepts SSH private key or private key phrase. To enable the use of these private keys, your project URL must begin with `git@`.
====
Proxy:: This is used to access access HTTP or HTTPS servers. This field is optional.
Source control branch/tag/commit:: This is the branch to checkout. In addition to branches, you can input tags, commit hashes, and arbitrary refs. Some commit hashes and refs may not be available unless you also provide a custom refspec. This field is optional.
Source control refspec:: A refspec to fetch (passed to the Ansible git module). This parameter allows access to references via the branch field not otherwise available. This field is optional.
