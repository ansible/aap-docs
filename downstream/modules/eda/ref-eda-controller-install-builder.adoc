[role="_abstract"]
To build images, you must have Podman or Docker installed, along with the `ansible-builder` Python package. 

The `--container-runtime` option must correspond to the Podman or Docker executable you intend to use.

When building a decision environment image, it must support the architecture that {PlatformNameShort} is deployed with.
