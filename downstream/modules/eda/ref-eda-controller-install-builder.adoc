= Installing ansible-builder

[role="_abstract"]
To build images, install `ansible-builder` Python package (along with Podman or Docker) to build the custom decision environments required for rulebooks. 

The `--container-runtime` option must correspond to the Podman or Docker executable you intend to use.

When building a decision environment image, it must support the architecture that {PlatformNameShort} is deployed with.

For more information, see link:https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/builder/en/latest/#quickstart-for-ansible-builder[Quickstart for Ansible Builder] or {LinkBuilder}.
