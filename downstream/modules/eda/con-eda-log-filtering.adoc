= {EDAName} log filtering

[role="_abstract"]
{EDAName} includes tracking identifiers in all log output to significantly improve troubleshooting. These identifiers help track user actions and activation processes across multiple services and log files.

.{EDAName} log tracking IDs
[cols="a,a,a,a"]
|===
| Identifier | Abbreviation | Purpose | Location

h| X-REQUEST-ID | `rid` | Tracks HTTP requests from the Platform Gateway through the entire {EDAName} request lifecycle. Use this to correlate UI actions or API calls with backend processing. | Included in the HTTP response headers and {EDAName} log entries.

h| Log Tracking ID | `tid` | Tracks the *activation lifecycle* from creation through completion, persisting across restarts and multiple log files. | Included in all activation-related log entries. It can be obtained from the activation *History* tab in the UI.

h| Activation Instance ID | `aiid` | Identifies the logs specific to a single execution instance of a rulebook activation, allowing you to view `ansible-rulebook` output for that run. | Included in activation logs.

[NOTE]
====
Not all processes originate from a user or external client. When an {EDAName} orchestrator internally triggers a process (for example, a monitor request), the `rid` UUID is generated internally to track that process lifecycle and will not be present in the {Gateway} logs.
====

The enhanced log format places these identifiers at the start of the message, making them easy to filter:

`[rid: <UUID>] [tid: <UUID>] [aiid: <ID>] aap_eda.tasks.orchestrator Processing request...``
