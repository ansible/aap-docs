= Building a custom decision environment for {EDAName}

[role="_abstract"]
Decision Environments are {ExecEnvShort}s tailored towards running Ansible Rulebooks.

Similar to {ExecEnvShort}s that run Ansible playbooks for {ControllerName}, decision environments are designed to run rulebooks for {EDAcontroller}.

You can create a custom decision environment for {EDAName} that provides a custom maintained or third-party event source plugin that is not available in the default decision environment.

.Prerequisites

* {PlatformNameShort} > = 2.5
* {EDAName}
* {Builder} > = 3.0

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Use the correct {EDAcontroller} decision environment in {PlatformNameShort} to prevent rulebook activation failure.

** If you want to connect {EDAcontroller} to {PlatformNameShort} 2.4, you must use `registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-24/de-minimal-rhel9:latest` (recommended) or `registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-24/de-minimal-rhel8:latest`
** If you want to connect {EDAcontroller} to {PlatformNameShort} 2.5, you must use `registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-25/de-minimal-rhel9:latest` (recommended) or `registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-25/de-minimal-rhel8:latest`
** If you want to connect {EDAcontroller} to {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers}, you must use `registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-26/de-minimal-rhel9:latest`

.Procedure

. Use `de-minimal` as the base image with {Builder} to build your custom decision environments. 
This image is built from a base image provided by Red Hat at link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/ansible-automation-platform-25/de-minimal-rhel9/650a5672a370728c710acaab[{PlatformNameShort} minimal decision environment].  
+
The following is an example of the {Builder} definition file that uses `de-minimal` as a base image to build a custom decision environment with the ansible.eda collection:
