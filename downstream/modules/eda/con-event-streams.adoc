= Event streams

[role="_abstract"]
Event streams can send events from remote systems to {EDAcontroller}. In a typical set-up, a server sends data to an event stream over the internet to an {EDAName} event stream receiver. When the data comes over the internet, the request must be authenticated. Depending on the webhook vendor or remote system, the authentication method could differ.

Event-Driven controller supports 7 different event stream types.
