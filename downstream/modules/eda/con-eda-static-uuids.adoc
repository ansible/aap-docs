= Static Unique Universal Identifiers (UUIDs) for event streams

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure an event stream with a static Unique Universal Identifier (UUID) to ensure its webhook URL remains consistent, even if the event stream service is recreated. 

This feature is relevant for disaster recovery scenarios where external systems, like firewalls or third-party webhooks, cannot be easily reconfigured to use a new URL. Here are key concepts when considering using static UUIDs:

Disaster recovery support::
A static UUID ensures that the external webhook URL, which follows the format, `https://your-eda-server.com/api/eda/v1/external_event_stream/{uuid}/`, does not change upon service recreation. 

Uniqueness::
The UUID you provide must be unique across all existing event streams in the system.

Security warning::
Static UUIDs make your webhook URLs predictable and, therefore, could reduce security. Only use this feature when URL consistency is critical and you have implemented strong additional security measures (like strong authentication and network restrictions). For normal operations, always use autogenerated (dynamic) UUIDs.

You must ensure that additional security measures are in place, such as robust credential types (HMAC, mTLS) and network restrictions.
