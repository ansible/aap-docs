= External secret management credential types

[role="_abstract"]
In addition to the built-in credential types, {EDAName} supports a variety of external secret management credential types. These credential types allow rulebooks to securely retrieve sensitive information (API keys, and similar) directly from your organization's centralized secret vault. 

The following external credential types are available for use in {EDAcontroller}:

* AWS Secrets Manager
* Azure Key Vault
* Centrify Vault Credential Provider
* CyberArk Central Credential Provider
* CyberArk Conjur Secrets Manager
* HashiCorp Vault Secret
* HashiCorp Vault Signed SSH
* Thycotic DevOps Secrets Vault
* Thycotic Secret Server
* GitHub App Installation Access Token

The process for using these credentials in a rulebook activation is consistent with how they are used in {ControllerName}.
