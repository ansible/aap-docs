=  System level monitoring for {EDAcontroller}

[role="_abstract"]
After characterizing your workload to determine how many rulebook activations you are running in parallel and how many events you are receiving at any given point, conduct system-level monitoring to ensure the host environment can sustain the resource demands of the event-driven workload.

Using system level monitoring to review information about {EDAName}’s performance over time helps when diagnosing problems or when considering capacity for future growth.

System level monitoring includes the following information:

* Disk I/O
* RAM utilization
* CPU utilization
* Network traffic 

Higher CPU, RAM, or Disk utilization can affect the overall performance of {EDAcontroller}. 

For example, a high utilization of any of these system level resources indicates that either the {EDAcontroller} is running too many rulebook activations, or some of the individual rulebook activations are using a high volume of resources. In this case, you must increase your system level resources to support your workload.
