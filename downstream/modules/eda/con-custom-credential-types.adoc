= Custom credential types

As a system administrator, you can define a custom credential type that works in ways similar to existing credential types in a standard format using a YAML or JSON-like definition. 

Each credential type displays its own unique configurations in the Input Configuration field and the Injector Configuration field, if applicable. Custom credentials support Ansible extra variables as a means of injecting their authentication information. 

You can attach one or more cloud, vault, and {PlatformName} credentials to a rulebook activation. 

[NOTE]
====
* When creating a new credential type, you must avoid collisions in the `extra_vars`.
* Extra variable names must not start with *EDA_* because they are reserved.
* You must have System administrator (superuser) permissions to be able to create and edit a credential type and to be able to view the *Injector configuration* field.
====

When you customize your own credential types, they will display on the Credential Types page along with a list of built-in credential types.

Each credential type displays its own unique configurations in the Input Configuration and the Injector Configuration fields, if applicable. Both YAML and JSON formats are supported in the configuration fields.
//Note from J. Self: REVIEWERS, please confirm the Note above along with the paragraph about attachning one SSH and multiple clouds to a job template. I copied this from automation controller content, but not entirely sure it's relevant to EDA.

== Input Configuration

The Input configuration has two attributes:

* fields - a collection of properties for a credential type.
* required - a list of required fields.

Fields can have multiple properties, depending on the credential type you select.

.Input Configuration Field Properties
[cols="a,a,a"]
|===
| Fields | Description | Mandatory (Y/N)

h| id | Unique id of the field; must be a string type and stores the variable name | Yes

h| type | Can be string or boolean type | No, default is string

h| label | Used by the UI when rendering the UI element | Yes

h| secret | Will be encrypted | No, default false

h| multiline | If the field contains data from a file the multiline can be set to True | No, default false

h| help_text | The help text associated with this field | No

== Injector Configuration

You can use Injector configuration to extract information from Input configuration fields and map them into injector types that can be sent to ansible-rulebook when running a rulebook activation. {EDAName} supports the following types of injectors: 

* Environment variables (`env`) - Used in source plugins for the underlying package or shared library.
* Ansible extra variables (`extra_vars`) - Used for substitution in the rulebook conditions, actions or source plugin parameters.
* File-based templating (`file`) - Used to create file contents from the credential inputs such as certificates and keys, which might be required by source plugins. File injectors provide a way to deliver these certificates and keys to ansible-rulebook at runtime without having to store them in decision environments. As a result, ansible-rulebook creates temporary files and the file names can be accessed using `eda.filename` variables, which are automatically created for you after the files have been created (for instance,  "{{eda.filename.my_cert}}‚Äù).

[IMPORTANT]
====
When creating `extra_vars` in rulebook activations and credential type injectors, avoid using `eda` or `ansible` as key names since that conflicts with internal usage and might cause failure in both rulebook activations and credential type creation.
====

Injectors enable you to adjust the fields so that they can be injected into a rulebook as one of the above-mentioned injector types, which cannot have duplicate keys at the top level. If you have two sources in a rulebook that both require parameters such as username and password, the injectors, along with the rulebook, help you adapt the arguments for each source.
