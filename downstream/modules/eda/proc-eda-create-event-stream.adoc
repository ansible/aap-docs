= Creating an event stream

[role="_abstract"]
Create a dedicated stream endpoint to simplify how external systems send events, making it easier to route data to multiple rulebook activations. 

.Prerequisites

* If you will be attaching your event stream to a rulebook activation, ensure that your activation has a decision environment and project already set up.
* If you plan to connect to {ControllerName} to run your rulebook activation, ensure that you have created a {PlatformName} credential type in addition to the decision environment and project. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/using_automation_decisions/eda-set-up-rhaap-credential-type#eda-set-up-rhaap-credential[Setting up a {PlatformName} credential].

.Procedure

. Log in to {PlatformNameShort}.
. From the navigation panel, select {MenuADEventStreams}.
. Click btn:[Create event stream].
. Insert the following:
+
Name:: Insert the name.
Organization:: Click the list to select an organization or select *Default*.
Event stream type:: Select the event stream type you prefer.
+
[NOTE]
====
This list displays at least 10 default event stream types that can be used to authenticate the connection coming from your remote server.
====
Credentials:: Select a credential from the list, preferably the one you created for your event stream.
Headers:: Enter HTTP header keys, separated by commas, that you want to include in the event payload.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If your automation relies on HTTP headers being present in the event payload, you must explicitly define them to avoid unintentional exposure of sensitive information. For more information about HTTP headers and how to securely configure them, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/using_automation_decisions/simplified-event-routing#eda-http-headers[HTTP headers] and link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/using_automation_decisions/simplified-event-routing#eda-configure-http-headers[Configuring HTTP headers securely for event streams].
====
+
Forward events to rulebook activation:: Use this option to enable or disable the capability of forwarding events to rulebook activations.
+
[NOTE]
====
The event stream's event forwarding can be disabled for testing purposes while diagnosing connections and evaluating the incoming data. Disabling the *Forward events to rulebook activation* option allows you to test the event stream connection with the remote system, analyze the header and payload, and if necessary, diagnose credential issues. This ensures that events are not be forwarded to rulebook activations causing rules and conditions to be triggered inadvertently while you are in test mode. Some enterprises might have policies to change secrets and passwords at regular cadence. You can enable/disable this option anytime after the event stream is created.
====

. Click btn:[Create event stream].

.Results
After creating your event stream, the following outputs occur:

* The Details page is displayed. From there or the Event Streams list view, you can edit or delete it. Also, the Event Streams page shows all of the event streams you have created and the following columns for each event: *Events received*, *Last event received*, and *Event stream type*. As the first two columns receive external data through the event stream, they are continuously updated to let you know they are receiving events from remote systems.
* If you disabled the event stream, the Details page is displayed with a warning message, *This event stream is disabled*. 
+
[NOTE]
====
After an event stream is created, the associated credential cannot be deleted until the event stream it is attached to is deleted.
====
* Your new event stream generates a URL that is necessary when you configure the webhook on the remote system that sends events.
