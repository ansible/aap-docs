= Configuring HTTP headers securely for event streams

[role="_abstract"]
To enhance event stream security, you must explicitly define which HTTP headers are passed. These headers carry the critical context and authentication data required for processing.

.Procedure

. To include all HTTP headers, enter an asterisk (*) in the Headers field. This allows all HTTP headers with the exception of a few headers:
* *Excluded:* Headers that begin with `X-Envoy`, `X-Trusted-Proxy`, `X-Forwarded-For`, and `X-Real-Id`
* *Redacted:* Authorization header (for example, `Authorization: Redacted`)
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If the *Headers* field is empty, none of the HTTP headers will be added to the event payload in Production and Test mode.
====
+
. To include a specific set of HTTP headers, enter the names of the desired headers as a comma-delimited string (for example, `Host,Authorization,X-Request-ID`).
