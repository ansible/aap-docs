= Replacing sources and attaching event streams to activations

When you create rulebook activations, you can use event streams to swap out source mappings in rulebook activations and simplify routing from external sources to {EDAcontroller}. 

There are several key points to keep in mind regarding source mapping:

. An event stream can only be used once in a rulebook source swap. If you have multiple sources in the rulebook, you can only replace each source once.
. The source mapping happens only in the current rulebook activation. You must repeat this process for any other activations using the same rulebook.
. The source mapping is valid only if the rulebook doesn't get modified. If the rulebook gets modified during the source mapping process, the source mapping would fail and it would  have to be repeated.
. If the rulebook is modified after the source mapping has been created and a *Restart* happens, the rulebook activation fails.


.Procedure

. Log in to {PlatformNameShort}.
. From the navigation panel, select {MenuADRulebookActivations}.
. Click btn:[Create rulebook activation].
. Insert the following:
+
Name:: Insert the name.
Description:: This field is optional.
Organization:: Enter your organization name or select Default from the list.
Project:: Projects are a logical collection of rulebooks. This field is optional.
+
[NOTE]
====
Although this field is optional, selecting a project helps refine your list of rulebooks choices. 
====

Rulebook:: Rulebooks are shown according to the project selected. Select a rulebook.
+
[NOTE]
====
After you have selected a rulebook, the Event streams field is enabled. You can click the gear icon to display the Event streams mapping form.   
====

Event streams:: All the event streams available and set up to forward events to rulebook actiavtions are displayed. If you have not created any event streams, this field remains disabled.
+
Click the gear icon to display the Event streams mapping UI. 
+

+
Complete the following fields:
+
Rulebook source::: A rulebook can contain multiple sources across multiple rulesets. You can map the same rulebook in multiple activations to multiple event streams. While managing event streams, unnamed sources are assigned temporary names (__SOURCE {n}) for identification purposes.
+
Select __SOURCE_1 from the list.
+
Event stream::: Select your event stream name from the list.
+
Click btn:[Save].
+
Event streams can replace matching sources in a rulebook, and are server-side webhooks that enable you to connect various event sources to your rulebook activations. Source types that can be replaced with the event stream's source of type ansible.eda.pg_listener include ansible.eda.webhook and other compatible webhook source plugins. Replacing selected sources affects this activation only, and modifies the rulebook's source type, source name, and arguments. Filters, rules, conditions, and actions are all unaffected.
+
You can select which source you want to replace with a single event stream. If there are multiple sources in your rulebook, you can choose to replace each one of them with event streams, but you are not required to replace each one. The following image displays which sources can be replaced.
+
image:eda-event-streams-swapping-sources.png[Event streams replacement sources]
+
The items in pink demonstrate the sources that can be replaced: source type, source name, and arguments. The remaining items (filters, rules, and actions) are not replaced. 
+
Credential:: Select 0 or more credentials for this rulebook activation. This field is optional.
+
[NOTE]
====
The credentials that display in this field are customized based on your rulebook activation and only include the following credential types: Vault, {PlatformName}, or any custom credential types that you have created. For more information on credentials, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.5/html-single/using_automation_decisions/index#eda-credentials[Credentials].
====
+
Decision environment:: A decision environment is a container image used to run Ansible rulebooks.
+
[NOTE]
====
In {EDAcontroller}, you cannot customize the pull policy of the decision environment. By default, it follows the behavior of the always policy. Every time an activation is started, the system tries to pull the most recent version of the image.
====
Restart policy:: This is the policy that determines how an activation should restart after the container process running the source plugin ends.
*** Policies:
... *Always*: This restarts the rulebook activation immediately, regardless of whether it ends successfully or not, and occurs no more than 5 times.
... *Never*: This never restarts a rulebook activation when the container process ends.
... *On failure*: This restarts the rulebook activation after 60 seconds by default, only when the container process fails, and occurs no more than 5 times.
Log level:: This field defines the severity and type of content in your logged events. 
*** Levels:
... *Error*: Logs that contain error messages that are displayed in the *History* tab of an activation. 
... *Info*: Logs that contain useful information about rulebook activations, such as a success or failure, triggered action names and their related action events, and errors.
... *Debug*: Logs that contain information that is only useful during the debug phase and might be of little value during production. 
This log level includes both error and log level data. 
Service name:: This defines a service name for Kubernetes to configure inbound connections if the activation exposes a port. This field is optional.
Rulebook activation enabled?:: This automatically enables the rulebook activation to run.
Variables:: The variables for the rulebook are in a JSON or YAML format.
The content would be equivalent to the file passed through the `--vars` flag of ansible-rulebook command.
Options:: Check the *Skip audit events* option if you do not want to see your events in the Rule Audit.
. Click btn:[Create rulebook activation].
+
After you create your rulebook activation, the *Details* page is displayed. 
+
You can navigate to the Event streams page to confirm your events have been received.
