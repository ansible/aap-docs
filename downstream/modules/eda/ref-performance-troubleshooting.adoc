* My activation status displays as “running”, but it is not processing the events.
** Ensure that you are using the correct event source in the rulebook activation.
If the event you are expecting is coming from a source other than what is in the rulebook, {EDAcontroller} will not process the event.

* My activation status displays as “running”, and {EDAcontroller} is also receiving the events, but no actions are occuring.
** Ensure that you have set the correct conditions for matching the event and taking actions in the rulebook activation.

* My activation keeps restarting in an infinite loop.
** By default, the reset policy for rulebook activations is set to *On Failure*. Change the restart policy using the following procedure:
. Navigate to {MenuADRulebookActivations}.
. Select the *Restart Policy* list to display the options. 
. Select the appropriate value: *On Failure*, *Always*, *Never*.
