=  Performance Troubleshooting for {EDAcontroller}

[role="_abstract"]
Based on the default parameters within {EDAcontroller}, you might encounter scenarios that pose challenges to completing your workload.
The following section provides descriptions of these scenarios and troubleshooting guidance.

* My activation status displays as “running”, but it is not processing the events.
** Ensure that you are using the correct event source in the rulebook activation.
If the event you are expecting is coming from a source other than what is in the rulebook, {EDAcontroller} will not process the event.

* My activation status displays as “running”, and {EDAcontroller} is also receiving the events, but no actions are occuring.
** Ensure that you have set the correct conditions for matching the event and taking actions in the rulebook activation.

* My activation keeps restarting in an infinite loop.
** By default, the reset policy for rulebook activations is set to “on failure”. Change the estart policy using the following procedure:
. Navigate to the Rulebook Activation screen.
. Click the Restart Policy drop down menu. 
. Choose the appropriate value: “On Failure”, “Always”, “Never”.
