= Injector Configuration

You can use Injector configuration to extract information from Input configuration fields and map them into injector types that can be sent to ansible-rulebook when running a rulebook activation. {EDAName} supports the following types of injectors: 

* Environment variables (`env`) - Used in source plugins for the underlying package or shared library.
* Ansible extra variables (`extra_vars`) - Used for substitution in the rulebook conditions, actions or source plugin parameters.
* File-based templating (`file`) - Used to create file contents from the credential inputs such as certificates and keys, which might be required by source plugins. File injectors provide a way to deliver these certificates and keys to ansible-rulebook at runtime without having to store them in decision environments. As a result, ansible-rulebook creates temporary files and the file names can be accessed using `eda.filename` variables, which are automatically created for you after the files have been created (for instance,  "{{eda.filename.my_cert}}‚Äù).

[IMPORTANT]
====
When creating `extra_vars` in rulebook activations and credential type injectors, avoid using `eda` or `ansible` as key names since that conflicts with internal usage and might cause failure in both rulebook activations and credential type creation.
====

Injectors enable you to adjust the fields so that they can be injected into a rulebook as one of the above-mentioned injector types, which cannot have duplicate keys at the top level. If you have two sources in a rulebook that both require parameters such as username and password, the injectors, along with the rulebook, help you adapt the arguments for each source.
