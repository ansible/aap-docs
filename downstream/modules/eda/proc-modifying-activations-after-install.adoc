= Modifying the number of simultaneous rulebook activations after {EDAcontroller} installation

[role="_abstract"]
By default, {EDAcontroller} allows 12 rulebook activations per node. For example, with two worker or hybrid nodes, it results in a limit of 24 activations in total to run simultaneously. 
You can modify this default value after installation by using the following procedure:

.Procedure
. Navigate to the environment file at `/etc/ansible-automation-platform/eda/settings.yaml`.
. Choose the number of maximum running activations that you need.
For example, `MAX_RUNNING_ACTIVATIONS = 16`
. Use the following command to restart {EDAName} services: `automation-eda-controller-service restart`
