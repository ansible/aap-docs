= Verifying your event streams work

[role="_abstract"]
Confirm end-to-end event flow by verifying the event stream receives data from the remote system, validating the webhook URL and authentication setup.

.Procedure
. Log in to {PlatformNameShort}.
. From the navigation panel, select {MenuADEventStreams}.
. Select the event stream that you created to validate connectivity and ensure that the event stream sends data to the rulebook activation. 
. Verify that the events were received. The number of *Events received* is displayed along with a header that contains details about the event.

//[JMS] Replace this image with one that shows a number for the Events received field.

+
If you scroll down in the UI, you can also see the body of the payload with more information about the webhook. 
+
The *Header* and *Body* sections for the event stream are displayed on the Details page. They differ based on the vendor who is sending the event. The header and body can be used to check the attributes in the event payload, which will help you in writing conditions in your rulebook.

//[JMSelf] Hide or maybe replace this image for now.

. Toggle the *Forward events to rulebook activation* option to  enable you to push your events to a rulebook activation.

.Results
This moves the event stream to production mode and makes it easy to attach to rulebook activations. When this option is toggled off, your ability to forward events to a rulebook activation is disabled and the *This event stream is disabled* message is displayed.
