= Rulebook activation list view

[role="_abstract"]
Use the *Rulebook Activations* list view to quickly monitor the operational status, event fire count, and restart frequency of all your deployed automation services.

If the *Status* is *Running*, it means that the rulebook activation is running in the background and executing the required actions according to the rules declared in the rulebook.

You can view more details by selecting the activation from the *Rulebook Activations* list view.
