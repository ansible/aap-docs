= Rulebook activation list view

[role="_abstract"]
On the *Rulebook Activations* page, you can view the rulebook activations that you have created along with the *Status*, *Number of rules* with the rulebook, the *Fire count*, and *Restart count*.

If the *Status* is *Running*, it means that the rulebook activation is running in the background and executing the required actions according to the rules declared in the rulebook.

You can view more details by selecting the activation from the *Rulebook Activations* list view.
