= Replacing sources and attaching event streams to activations

You can create a new rulebook activation, select a project and rulebook for it, and crucially, update its event source to subscribe to a desired event stream (in this case, *Repo Event Stream* that you created earlier).

.Prerequisites
* Ensure that your Projects have been set up properly. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.6/html-single/using_automation_decisions/index#eda-set-up-new-project[Setting up a new project].

.Procedure

. From the {PlatformNameShort} navigation panel, select {MenuADRulebookActivations}.
. Click btn:[Create rulebook activation] to create a rulebook for events on an application repository for Linux servers.
. In the *Name* field, enter `Repo Events - RHEL`.
. For your *Organization*, select *Default* from the list.
//. From the *Project* list, select *GitOps EventStream*.
//. Select *gitops-rhel.yml* for your *Rulebook*.
. In the *Event streams* field, click the gear icon to select which event stream the rulebook needs to subscribe to. The Event streams window is displayed.
. Replace an ansible.eda.webhook or compatible custom source with the desired event stream. This modifies the activation only, while leaving your filters intact.
. Select *Repo Event Stream* from the list of event streams that you created.
. Click *Save* to save your event stream.
. Next to the *Credential* field, click the *Search* icon to access {ControllerName} and connect with job templates and workflows. The *Select credential* message is displayed.
//. Select the *AAP* credential and click *Confirm*.
. Select the *Decision Environment* from the list.
. Click *Create rulebook activation*. The activation status is displayed (if successful, the *Running* status displays).
. Repeat the following steps to create an additional rulebook activation using the same process as your first activation: 
.. In the *Event streams* field, click the gear icon to select which event stream the rulebook needs to subscribe to.
.. Select the *Repo Event Stream* from the list of event streams that you created.
.. Click *Save* to save your event stream.
.. Click *Create rulebook activation* to save the configuration and start the rulebook. 

.Results
Now, there are two rulebook activations running and you can commit some code to one of your repositories. An event has been received and routed to your rulebooks.
