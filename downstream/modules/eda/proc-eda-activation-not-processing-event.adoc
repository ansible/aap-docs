= Resolve event processing failures in rulebook activations

[role="_abstract"]
Troubleshoot why a running rulebook activation is failing to process events, focusing on common causes like source definition mismatches or internal processing errors.

.Procedure

. *Check the rulebook source:* Review the source plugin defined in your rulebook YAML (for example, ansible.eda.webhook, ansible.eda.kafka).
. *Verify event input:* Confirm that the events you are sending to {EDAcontroller} are compatible with the source plugin defined in the rulebook. If the rulebook expects a Kafka message, it cannot process a generic webhook event.
. *Confirm activation mapping:* If you are using event streams, ensure the correct event stream is mapped to the rulebook during the activation setup. A mismatch here will result in the activation receiving no data.
