The `manifest.yml` file serves as the primary metadata document for the migration artifact.
It contains critical versioning and component information from your source environment. 

Structure the manifest as follows:

----
---
aap_version: X.Y # The version being migrated
platform: rpm # The source platform type
components:
  - name: controller
    version: x.y.z
  - name: hub
    version: x.y.z
  - name: gateway
    version: x.y.z
