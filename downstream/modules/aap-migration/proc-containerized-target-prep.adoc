[id="containerized-target-prep"]
= Preparing and assessing the target environment

[role="_abstract"]
To prepare your target environment, perform the following steps.

.Procedure

. Validate the file system home folder size and make sure it has enough space to transfer the artifact.
. Transfer the artifact to the nodes where you will be working by using `scp` or any preferred file transfer method. It is recommended that you work from the {Gateway} node as it will have access to most systems. However, if you have access or file system space limitations due to the PostgreSQL dumps, then work from the database node.
. Download the latest version of containerized {PlatformNameShort} from the link:{PlatformDownloadUrl}[{PlatformNameShort} download page]. 
. Validate the artifact checksum.
. Extract the artifact on the home folder for the user running the containers.
+
----
$ cd ~
----
+
----
$ sha256sum-check artifact.tar.sha256
----
+
----
$ tar xf artifact.tar
----
+
----
$ cd artifact
----
+
----
$ sha256sum-check sha256sum.txt
----

. Generate inventory file for containerized deployment.
+
Configure the inventory file to match the same topology as the source environment. Configure the component database names and the `secret_key` values seen on the `secrets.yml` file from the artifact. You can do this by either setting the extra variables in the inventory file or by using the `secrets.yml` file as an additional variables file when running the installation program.
+
.. Option 1: Extra variables in the inventory file
+
----
$ egrep 'pg_database|_key' inventory
controller_pg_database=<redacted>
controller_secret_key=<redacted>
gateway_pg_database=<redacted>
gateway_secret_key=<redacted>
hub_pg_database=<redacted>
hub_secret_key=<redacted>
__hub_database_fields=<redacted>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `__hub_database_fields` value comes from the `hub_db_fields_encryption_key` value in your secret.
====
+
.. Option 2: Additional variables file
+
----
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory ansible.containerized_installer.install -e @~/artifact/secrets.yml -e "__hub_database_fields='{{ hub_db_fields_encryption_key }}'"
----

. Install and configure the containerized target environment.
. Verify PostgreSQL database version is on version 15.
. Create a backup of the initial containerized environment.
+
----
$ ansible-playbook -i <path_to_inventory> ansible.containerized_installer.backup
----

. Ensure the fresh installation is functional.
