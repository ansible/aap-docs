= Prerequisites for migrating from a container-based deployment to a Managed {PlatformNameShort} deployment

[role="_abstract"]
Before migrating from a container-based deployment to a Managed {PlatformNameShort} deployment, ensure that you meet the following prerequisites:

* You have a source container-based deployment of {PlatformNameShort}.
* The source deployment is on the latest release of the {PlatformNameShort} version you are on.
* You have a target Managed {PlatformNameShort} deployment.
* You have enabled local authentication on the source deployment before the migration.
* A local administrator account must be functional on the source deployment before migration. Verify this by performing a successful login to the source deployment.
* You have a plan to retain a backup throughout the migration process and to ensure that your existing {PlatformNameShort} deployment remains active until your migration has completed successfully.
* You have a plan for any environment changes based on the migration from a self-hosted {PlatformNameShort} deployment to a Managed {PlatformNameShort} deployment:
** Job log retention changes from a customer-configured option to 30 days.
** Network changes occur when moving the control plane to the managed service.
** {AutomationMeshStart} requires reconfiguration.
* You must reconfigure or re-create SSO identity providers post-migration to account for URL changes.
