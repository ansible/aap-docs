= Migration process overview

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can only migrate to a different installation type of the same {PlatformNameShort} version. For example you can migrate from RPM version {PlatformVers} to containerized {PlatformVers}, but not from RPM version 2.4 to containerized {PlatformVers}.
====

The migration between {PlatformNameShort} installation types follows this general workflow:

. Prepare and assess the source environment - Prepare and assess the existing source environment for migration.
. Export the source environment - Extract the necessary data and configurations from the source environment.
. Create and verify the migration artifact - Package all collected data and configurations into a migration artifact.
. Prepare and assess the target environment - Prepare and assess the new target environment for migration.
. Import the migration content to the target environment - Transfer the migration artifact into the prepared target environment.
. Reconcile the target environment post-import - Address any inconsistencies and reconfigure services in the target environment after import.
. Validate the target environment - Confirm the migrated environment is fully operational.
