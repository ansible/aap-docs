= Migration process overview

[role="_abstract"]
Understand the complete migration workflow including preparation, export, artifact creation, import, reconciliation, and validation steps for moving between {PlatformNameShort} installation types.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can only migrate to a different installation type of the same {PlatformNameShort} version. For example, you can migrate from RPM version {PlatformVers} to containerized {PlatformVers}, but not from RPM version 2.4 to containerized {PlatformVers}.
====

The migration between {PlatformNameShort} installation types follows this general workflow:

. Prepare and assess the source environment
. Export the source environment
. Create and verify the migration artifact
. Prepare and assess the target environment
. Import the migration content to the target environment
. Reconcile the target environment post-import
. Validate the target environment
