= Reconciling the target environment post-import

[role="_abstract"]
Perform the following post-import reconciliation steps to ensure your target environment is fully functional and correctly configured.

.Procedure
. Deprovision the {Gateway} configuration.

** Deprovision {Gateway} configuration SSH to the host serving an `automation-gateway` container as the same rootless user from 4.2.6 and run the following to remove the {Gateway} proxy configuration:
+
----
$ podman exec -it automation-gateway bash
$ aap-gateway-manage migrate
$ aap-gateway-manage shell_plus
>>> HTTPPort.objects.all().delete(); ServiceNode.objects.all().delete(); ServiceCluster.objects.all().delete()
----

. Transfer custom configurations and settings.

** Edit the inventory file and apply any relevant `extra_settings` to each component by using the `component_extra_settings`. 

. Update the Resource Server Secret Key for each component.
.. Gather the current Resource Secret values for each component:
+
----
$ podman exec -it automation-gateway bash -c 'aap-gateway-manage shell_plus --quiet -c "[print(cl.name, key.secret) for cl in ServiceCluster.objects.all() for key in cl.service_keys.all()]"'
----

.. Validate the current secret values:
+
----
$ for secret_name in eda_resource_server hub_resource_server controller_resource_server
do
echo $secret_name
podman secret inspect $secret_name --showsecret | grep SecretData
done
----

.. If the secret value does not match the current values, delete the existing secret and re-create it, updating it with the new value:

... Delete the secret:
+
----
$ podman secret rm <SECRET_NAME>
----

... Re-create the secret:
+
----
$ echo "secret_value" | podman secret create <SECRET_NAME> -
----
+
Replace the `<SECRET_NAME>` placeholder in the commands above with the appropriate secret name for each component: `eda_resource_server` ({EDAName}), `hub_resource_server` ({HubName}), and `controller_resource_server` ({ControllerName}).

. Re-run the installation program on the target environment by using the same inventory from the installation.

. Validate instances for automation execution.

.. SSH to the host serving an `automation-controller-task` container as the rootless user, and run the following commands to validate and remove instances that are orphaned from the source artifact:
+
----
$ podman exec -it automation-controller-task bash
----
+
----
$ awx-manage list_instances
----

.. Find nodes that are no longer part of this cluster. A good indicator is nodes with 0 capacity as they have failed their health checks:
+
----
[ungrouped capacity=0]
	[DISABLED] node1.example.org capacity=0 node_type=hybrid version=X.Y.Z heartbeat="..."
	[DISABLED] node2.example.org capacity=0 node_type=execution version=ansible-runner-X.Y.Z heartbeat="..."
----

.. Remove those nodes with `awx-manage`, leaving only the `aap-controller-task` instance:
+
----
awx-manage deprovision_instance --host=node1.example.org
awx-manage deprovision_instance --host=node2.example.org
----

. Repair orphaned {HubName} content links for Pulp.

** Run the following command from any host that has direct access to the {HubName} address:
+
----
$ curl -d '{\"verify_checksums\": true }' -X POST -k https://<gateway url>/api/galaxy/pulp/api/v3/repair/ -u <gateway_admin_user>:<gateway_admin_password>
----

. Reconcile instance groups configuration:
.. Go to {MenuInfrastructureInstanceGroups}. 
.. Select the *Instance Group* and then select the *Instances* tab. 
.. Associate or disassociate instances as required.

. Reconcile decision environments and credentials:
.. Go to {MenuADDecisionEnvironments}.
.. Edit each decision environment which references a registry URL either unrelated or no longer accessible to this new environment. For example, the {HubName} decision environment might require modification for the target {HubName} environment.
.. Select each associated credential to these decision environments and ensure their addresses align with the new environment.

. Reconcile execution environments and credentials:
.. Go to {MenuInfrastructureExecEnvironments}.
.. Check each {ExecEnvShort} image and verify their addresses against the new environment.
.. Go to {MenuAECredentials}.
.. Edit each credential and ensure that all environment specific information aligns with the new environment.

. Verify any further customizations or configurations after the migration, such as RBAC rules with instance groups.
