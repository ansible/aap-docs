= Validating the target environment

[role="_abstract"]
After completing the migration, validate that all components in your target environment function correctly.

.Procedure
. Verify all migrated components function correctly.
.. {GatewayStart}: Access the {PlatformNameShort} URL at `\https://<gateway_hostname>/` and verify that the dashboard loads correctly. Check that the {Gateway} service is running and connected to {ControllerName}.
.. {ControllerNameStart}: Under *Automation Execution*, check that projects, inventories, and job templates are present and configured.
.. {HubNameStart}: Under *Automation Content*, verify that collections, namespaces, and their contents are visible.
.. {EDAName} (if applicable): Under *Automation Execution Decisions*, verify that rule audits, rulebook activations, and projects are accessible.
.. For each component, check the logs to ensure there are no startup errors or warnings:
+
----
podman logs <container_name>
----

. Test workflows and automation processes.
.. Run job templates: Run several key job templates, including those with dependencies on various credential types.
.. Test workflow templates: Run workflow templates to ensure that workflow nodes run in the correct order and that the workflow completes successfully.
.. Verify execution environments: Ensure that jobs run in the appropriate execution environments and can access required dependencies.
.. Check job artifacts: Verify that job artifacts are properly stored and accessible.
.. Validate job scheduling: Test scheduled jobs to ensure they run at the expected times.

. Validate user access and permissions.
.. User authentication: Test login functionality with various user accounts to ensure authentication works correctly.
.. Role-based access controls: Verify that users have appropriate permissions for organizations, projects, inventories, and job templates.
.. Team memberships: Confirm that team memberships and team-based permissions are intact.
.. API access: Test API tokens and ensure that API access is functioning properly.
.. SSO integration (if applicable): Verify that Single Sign-On authentication is working correctly.

. Confirm content synchronization and availability.
.. Collection synchronization: Check that you can synchronize collections from a remote.
.. Collection Upload: Check that you can upload collections.
.. Collection repositories: Verify that {HubName} makes collections available and that execution environments can use them.
.. Project synchronization: Check that projects can sync content from source control repositories.
.. External content sources: Test synchronization from {HubName} and {Galaxy} (if configured).
.. Execution environment availability: Confirm that all required execution environments exist and that execution nodes can access them.
.. Content dependencies: Verify that the system correctly resolves content dependencies when running jobs.
