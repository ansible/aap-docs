= Validating the target environment

[role="_abstract"]
After completing the migration, validate your target environment to ensure all components are functional and operating as expected.

.Procedure
. Verify all migrated components are functional.
+
To ensure that all components have been successfully migrated, verify that each component is operational and accessible:
+
.. {GatewayStart}: Access the {PlatformNameShort} URL at `https://<gateway_hostname>/` and verify that the dashboard loads correctly. Check that the {Gateway} service is running and properly connected to {ControllerName}.
.. {ControllerNameStart}: Under *Automation Execution*, check that projects, inventories, and job templates are present and properly configured.
.. {HubNameStart}: Under *Automation Content*, verify that collections, namespaces, and their contents are visible.
.. {EDAName} (if applicable): Under *Automation Execution Decisions*, verify that rule audits, rulebook activations, and projects are accessible.
+
For each component, check the logs to ensure there are no startup errors or warnings:
+
----
podman logs <container_name>
----

. Test workflows and automation processes.
+
After you have confirmed that all components are functional, test critical automation workflows to ensure they operate correctly in the containerized environment:
+
.. Run job templates: Run several key job templates, including those with dependencies on various credential types.
.. Test workflow templates: Run workflow templates to ensure that workflow nodes run in the correct order and that the workflow completes successfully.
.. Verify execution environments: Ensure that jobs run in the appropriate execution environments and can access required dependencies.
.. Check job artifacts: Verify that job artifacts are properly stored and accessible.
.. Validate job scheduling: Test scheduled jobs to ensure they run at the expected times.

. Validate user access and permissions.
+
Confirm that user accounts, teams, and roles were correctly migrated:
+
.. User authentication: Test login functionality with various user accounts to ensure authentication works correctly.
.. Role-based access controls: Verify that users have appropriate permissions for organizations, projects, inventories, and job templates.
.. Team memberships: Confirm that team memberships and team-based permissions are intact.
.. API access: Test API tokens and ensure that API access is functioning properly.
.. SSO integration (if applicable): Verify that Single Sign-On authentication is working correctly.

. Confirm content synchronization and availability.
+
Ensure that all content sources are properly configured and accessible:
+
** Collection synchronization: Check that you can synchronize collections from a remote.
** Collection Upload: Check that you can upload collections.
** Collection repositories: Verify that collections are available in {HubName} and can be used in execution environments.
** Project synchronization: Check that projects can sync content from source control repositories.
** External content sources: Test synchronization from {HubName} and {Galaxy} (if configured).
** Execution environment availability: Confirm that all required execution environments are available and can be accessed by the execution nodes.
** Content dependencies: Verify that content dependencies are correctly resolved when running jobs.
