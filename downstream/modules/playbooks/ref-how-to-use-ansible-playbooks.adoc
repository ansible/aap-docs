= How do I use Ansible Playbooks

[role="_abstract"]
Ansible Playbooks are files containing a series of instructions that define the required state of a system or application. 
They are written in YAML, a human-readable data serialization format, and are used to automate IT tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration.

You can use YAML to create playbooks without having to learn a complicated coding language.
//Commenting out as no downstream alternative [AAP-57435]
//For more information on YAML, see YAML Syntax and consider installing an add-on for your text editor, see link:https://docs.ansible.com/projects/ansible/latest/community/other_tools_and_programs.html#other-tools-and-programs[Other Tools and Programs] to help you write clean YAML syntax in your playbooks.

There are two ways of using Ansible Playbooks: 

* From the _command line interface_ (CLI) 
* Using {PlatformName}'s push-button deployments.

== From the CLI
After installing the open source Ansible project or {PlatformName} by using

----
$ sudo dnf install ansible
----
in the {RHEL} CLI, you can use the `ansible-playbook` command to run Ansible Playbooks.

== From within the platform
The {PlatformName} user interface offers push-button Ansible Playbook deployments that can be used as part of larger jobs or job templates. 
These deployments come with additional safeguards that are particularly helpful to users who are newer to IT automation, or those without as much experience working in the CLI.
