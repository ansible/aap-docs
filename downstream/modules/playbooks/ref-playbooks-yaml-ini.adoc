= Inventories in INI or YAML format

[role="_abstract"]
You can create inventories by using either INI files or in YAML. 
In most cases, such as the preceding example, INI files are straightforward and easy to read for a small number of managed nodes.
Creating an inventory in YAML format becomes a sensible option as the number of managed nodes increases. 

The following is the same as `inventory.ini` that declares unique names for managed nodes and uses the `ansible_host` field:

myhosts:
  hosts:
    my_host_01:
      ansible_host: 192.0.2.50
    my_host_02:
      ansible_host: 192.0.2.51
    my_host_03:
      ansible_host: 192.0.2.52
