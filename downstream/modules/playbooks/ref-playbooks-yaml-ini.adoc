= Inventories in INI or YAML format

You can create inventories in either INI files or in YAML. 
In most cases, such as the preceding example, INI files are straightforward and easy to read for a small number of managed nodes.
Creating an inventory in YAML format becomes a sensible option as the number of managed nodes increases. 

The following is an equivalent of the `inventory.ini` that declares unique names for managed nodes and uses the `ansible_host` field:

----
myhosts:
  hosts:
    my_host_01:
      ansible_host: 192.0.2.50
    my_host_02:
      ansible_host: 192.0.2.51
    my_host_03:
      ansible_host: 192.0.2.52
