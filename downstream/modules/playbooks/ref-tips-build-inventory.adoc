= Tips for building inventories

[role="_abstract"]
When building inventories for Ansible automation, consider the following best practices to ensure efficient and effective management of your hosts.

* Ensure that group names are meaningful and unique. 
* Group names are also case sensitive.
* Do not use spaces, hyphens, or preceding numbers (use floor_19, not 19th_floor) in group names.
* Group hosts in your inventory logically according to their What, Where, and When:

** What: Group hosts according to the topology, for example: db, web, leaf, spine.
** Where: Group hosts by geographic location, for example: data center, region, floor, building.
** When: Group hosts by stage, for example: development, test, staging, production.
