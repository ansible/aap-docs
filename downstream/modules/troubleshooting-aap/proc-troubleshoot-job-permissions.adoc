= Issue - Jobs failing with insufficient permissions error in {PrivateHubName}

[role="_abstract"]

.Procedure

. Go to {ControllerName}.
. From the navigation panel, select menu:Administration[Execution Environments].
. Click the {ExecEnvShort} assigned to the job template that is failing.
. Click btn:[Edit].
. Assign the appropriate *Registry credential* from your {PrivateHubName} to the {ExecEnvShort}.
