= Troubleshooting SSL/TLS issues

To troubleshoot issues with SSL/TLS, verify the certificate chain, use the correct certificates, and confirm that a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) signed the certificate. 

.Procedure

. Check if the server is reachable over SSL/TLS.
.. Run the following command to confirm whether the server is reachable over SSL/TLS and to see the full certificate chain:
+
----
# true | openssl s_client -showcerts -connect <fqdn_or_ip>:<port>
----
+
.. Replace `<fqdn_or_ip>` and `<port>` with suitable values.
. Verify the certificate details.
.. Run the following command to view the details of a certificate:
+
----
# openssl x509 -in <path_to_certificate> -noout -text
----
+
. Replace `<path_to_certificate>` with the path to the certificate file you want to inspect.
+
The result of the command shows information such as:

* Subject - The entity the certificate has been issued to.
* Issuer - The CA that issued the certificate.
* Validity "Not Before" - The date the certificate was issued.
* Validity "Not After" - The date the certificate expires.
+
. Verify a trusted CA signed the certificate.
.. Run the following command to verify that a specific certificate is valid and was signed by a trusted CA:
+
----
openssl verify -CAfile <path_to_ca_public_certificate> <path_to_server_certificate_file_to_verify>
----
+
.. If the command returns `OK`, it means the certificate file is valid and signed by a trusted CA.
