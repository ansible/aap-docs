= Issue - Jobs are failing with “ERROR! couldn’t resolve module/action” error message

Jobs are failing with the error message “ERROR! couldn't resolve module/action 'module name'. This often indicates a misspelling, missing collection, or incorrect module path”.

This error can happen when the collection associated with the module is missing from the {ExecEnvShort}.

The recommended resolution is to create a custom {ExecEnvShort} and add the required collections inside of that {ExecEnvShort}. For more information about creating an {ExecEnvShort}, see link:{URLBuilder}/assembly-using-builder[Using {Builder}] in _{TitleBuilder}_.
