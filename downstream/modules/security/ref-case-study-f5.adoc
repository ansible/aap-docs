[role="_abstract"]

Event-driven automation provides immediate response to suspicious activity. 
The versatility of {EDAName} is demonstrated by the F5 Application Delivery and Security Platform. 
When unusual or malicious activity is detected within the F5 Application Delivery and Security Platform through event monitoring tools such as Elasticsearch and Kibana, {EDAName} rulebooks respond immediately to stop a potential attack by using F5 solutions such as F5 Advanced WAF and BIG-IP Application Security Manager.

This agentless automation system uses existing transport mechanisms, such as APIs and webhooks, for easier interoperability. 
F5 content collections for {EDAName} are developed by F5 and certified by Red Hat to ensure reliable automation and support. 
Together, F5 and Red Hat help organizations to reduce risk, achieve a faster mean time to resolution, and ultimately free up limited resources to focus on high-value tasks.
