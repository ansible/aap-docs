= Patching examples

[role="_abstract"]
The following playbooks are provided as patching examples, and should be modified to fit the target environment and tested thoroughly before being used in production. 
These examples use the `ansible.builtin.dnf` module for managing packages on RHEL and other operating systems that use the `dnf` package manager. 
Modules for patching other Linux operating systems, Microsoft Windows, and many network devices are also available.
