= Security operations use cases

The following security operations use cases benefit from automation with F5 and {EDAName}:

= Enriched security investigations

Cyberattacks are perpetual threats to organizations, and security tools generate more alerts than understaffed security teams can investigate. Organizations can generate significant savings by enabling their security teams to identify and remediate issues more efficiently through automation. A common first step for security automation is to expedite the investigation phase of potential security incidents by following pre-defined investigation playbooks. When a new security event triggers an Ansible rulebook, automated workflows gather and correlate data from multiple F5 solutions to significantly decrease the amount of time that the security analyst must spend on the investigation, which results in a faster mean time to identify and contain an incident.

= Improved threat hunting

Enterprises manage a large number of endpoint devices.  This attack surface exposes an organization to multiple threat vectors. Many security teams lack the resources to invest in proactive threat hunting, but by using automation to monitor and correlate threat data and produce actionable insights, security teams can prevent security issues more effectively and quickly detect threat exposure. 

= Faster response to security incidents

In the context of automated cyberattacks, immediate threat response is vital. Security teams can use automation that executes pre-built, verified workflows for instant response to contain or prevent security incidents, which reduces  attacker dwell time and damage. Rules determine which workflows to trigger based on specific events. When the event is detected, automation takes effect to remediate the issue, prevent attacker access, quarantine endpoints, or update security policies to prevent future occurrences. For example, if a malicious user is detected trying to access an application, event monitoring can trigger an Ansible Rulebook that instructs F5 Advanced WAF to block the malicious user while continuing to allow application access by legitimate users.
