= Example using F5 and {EDAName}

[role="_abstract"]
Example code using F5 and {EDAName} is available on GitHub. 
This code notes each instance of the watcher finding a match in its filter and then copies the source IP from that code into a CSV list. 
The list is then sent as a variable within the webhook along with the message to execute the code.
 
This high level workflow is described in the following diagram and code workflow example:

The workflow steps are:

. The F5 BIG-IP pushes the monitoring logs to Elastic.
. Elastic takes that data and stores it while using a watcher with its filters and criteria.
. The Watcher detects an event that matches its criteria and sends the webhook with payload to {EDAName}.
. {EDAName}'s rulebook triggers from the event which triggers a job template within {PlatformNameShort}, that sends the payload provided by Elastic.  
. {PlatformNameShort}’s template executes a playbook to secure the F5 BIG-IP using the payload provided by {EDAName} (originally provided by Elastic).
