= Benefits of patch automation

[role="_abstract"]
Automating the patching process provides a number of benefits:

* Reduces error-prone manual effort.
* Decreases time to deploy patches at scale.
* Ensures consistency of patches across similar systems. Manual patching of similar systems can result in human error (forgetting one or more, patching using different versions) that impacts consistency.
* Enables orchestration of complex patching scenarios where an update might require taking a system snapshot before applying a patch, or might require additional configuration changes when the patch is applied.
