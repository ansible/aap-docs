= Validate content with the AI assistant

[role="_abstract"]
Ask the AI assistant to analyze the current playbook without modifying it. This identifies specific rule violations and potential errors.
If errors are found, `ansible_lint` has autofix functionality, enabling it to suggest changes, and, with your permission, implement those changes in your code.

.Procedure
. Open the playbook file in the {VSCode} editor.
. Open the Copilot Chat window.
. In the chat window, enter a natural language prompt such as:
* _Validate my webserver playbook to check for any issues_.
+
This triggers the `ansible-lint` tool in check-only mode. The assistant displays a list of the issues it found, including Rule IDs, line numbers, and descriptions of the errors (for example, missing FQCN, or YAML formatting issues).
+
The assistant will ask "_Would you like ansible-lint to apply automatic fixes?_” You must grant the AI assistant permission to make any changes to your code.
+
. Enter “yes” or “no” depending on whether you want the assistant to apply the suggested changes.
. Select the option to *allow* or *skip* to grant the assistant permission to make changes.
.. If you select *allow*, the agent will update your code.
.. If you select *skip*, the agent will output a list of issues and the suggested fix for each.
