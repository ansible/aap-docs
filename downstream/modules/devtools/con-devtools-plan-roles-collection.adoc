[id="plan-roles-collection_{context}"]
= Planning your collection

Organize smaller bundles of curated automation into separate collections for specific functions, rather than creating one big general collection for all of your roles.

For example, you could store roles that manage the networking for an internal system called `myapp` in a `company_namespace.myapp_network` collection,
and store roles that manage and deploy networking in AWS in a collection called `company_namespace.aws_net`.
