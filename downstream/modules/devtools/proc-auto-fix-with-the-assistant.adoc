[id="auto-fix-with-the-assistant_{context}"]
= Auto-fixing errors with the AI assistant

[role="_abstract"]
You can also prompt the AI agent to auto-fix errors that `ansible_lint` finds. 

.Procedure
. In the GitHub Copilot chat window, enter the following prompt:
* _Run ansible-lint on my webserver playbook and apply automatic fixes_.
+
The AI triggers the `ansible_lint`` tool with the `fix: true` parameter.
+
. The tool then processes the file and applies corrections for issues such as:

* Converting short module names to fully qualified ones.
* Correcting YAML indentation and Jinja2 expression spacing.
* Fixing key ordering within tasks.

.Verification
When the AI agent completes the auto fixes, confirm the updates by taking the following steps.

* Either verify in the chat window that the AI  has displayed the fixed content, or confirm that the file has been updated.
* Review your open file in the editor. Changes (such as updated module names) should be reflected immediately in the code.
