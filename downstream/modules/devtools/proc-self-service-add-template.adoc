= Adding a template to {SelfServiceShort}

You can add a custom self-service template to the *Templates* view of your {SelfServiceShort} instance.
Custom self-service templates are stored in git repositories.
{SelfServiceShort} supports GitLab and GitHub Source Control Management (SCM).

[NOTE]
====
Names for custom self-service templates must be unique. 
Custom self-service templates must have a different name to auto-generated job templates and also to other custom self-service templates.

.Prerequisites

* You have created repositories in your Git SCM for the templates that you want to use.
* In the git repository for your custom templates, ensure that the `metadata.name` field is unique and does not match an existing auto-generated template or another custom self-service template.
For example, append `*-custom` to the value of the `metadata.name` key.

metadata:
  name: provision-database-custom
