= Adding a template to {SelfServiceShort}

You can add a tile for a custom self-service template to the *Templates* view of your {SelfServiceShort} instance.
The custom self-service template is defined in a git repository. 

[NOTE]
====
Names for custom self-service templates must be unique. 
Custom self-service templates must have a different name to auto-generated job templates and also to other custom self-service templates.

.Prerequisites

* You have created repositories in your Git SCM for the templates that you want to use.
* In the git repository for your custom templates, ensure that the `metadata.name` field is unique and does not match an existing auto-generated template or another custom self-service template.
For example, append `*-custom` to the value of the `metadata.name` key.
----
metadata:
  name: provision-database-custom
----
* You must be logged in to {SelfServiceShort} as an {PlatformNameShort} platform administrator.

.Procedure
. In a browser, navigate to your {SelfServiceShort} instance and sign in with your {PlatformNameShort} credentials.
. Navigate to the *Templates* Page.
. Click btn:[Add template].
. Enter a valid Git SCM URL for the template that you want to add.
. Click btn:[Analyze] to fetch the template.
. After the template has been fetched, review the list of what will be imported and added to the catalog.
. Click btn:[Import].

.Verification
After the import is complete, return to the *Templates* page to view the newly created template.
You can now launch your template.
// A populated *Templates* page resembles the following:

.Next steps
* You must configure RBAC for your imported custom templates, bearing in mind that a user who wants to launch a template that is associated with a job template in {PlatformNameShort} must have access to that job template.
