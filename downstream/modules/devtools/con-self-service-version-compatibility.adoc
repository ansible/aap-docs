= Understanding {SelfServiceShort} version compatibility

[role="_abstract"]
When upgrading {SelfServiceShort}, ensure version compatibility between the Helm chart, plug-in bundle, and {PlatformNameShort} version to avoid installation or upgrade failures.

== Version components

A {SelfServiceShort} deployment consists of three version-dependent components:

Helm chart version::
The version of the {SelfServiceShort} Helm chart deployed in {OCPShort}.
Example: `2.1.0`

Plug-in bundle version::
The version of the Ansible plug-ins setup bundle downloaded from the Red Hat Customer Portal.
Example: `self-service-automation-portal-plugins-2.1.0.tar.gz`

{PlatformNameShort} version::
The version of {PlatformNameShort} that {SelfServiceShort} connects to.
Example: `2.6`

== Version alignment requirements

For a successful {SelfServiceShort} upgrade:

* The Helm chart version and plug-in bundle version must match exactly.
+
Example: Helm chart version `2.1.0` requires plug-in bundle `2.1.0`.

* The {SelfServiceShort} version must be compatible with your {PlatformNameShort} version.
+
See the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/ansible-automation-platform[{PlatformNameShort} Life Cycle] for version compatibility information.

== Common version mismatch scenarios

The following scenarios can cause upgrade failures:

Plug-in bundle and Helm chart mismatch::
If you download plug-in bundle version `2.0.0` but upgrade to Helm chart version `2.0.1`, the installation fails with an error indicating that required plug-in files are not found or have incorrect versions.

Stale plug-in bundle::
If you download a plug-in bundle, and a new version is released before you complete the installation, you might install an outdated bundle with a newer Helm chart.
This causes version mismatch errors during deployment.

== Best practices for version management

To avoid version mismatch issues during upgrades:

. Identify your target version before starting the upgrade process.
+
Check the link:{PlatformDownloadUrl}[Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Product Software downloads page] for the latest available versions.

. Download the plug-in bundle and upgrade the Helm chart in the same maintenance window.
+
This minimizes the risk of version drift between download and installation.

. Verify the plug-in bundle version before extracting it.
+
Check that the filename version (for example, `2.1.0` in `self-service-automation-portal-plugins-2.1.0.tar.gz`) matches your target Helm chart version.

. Keep a record of your current {SelfServiceShort} version.
+
Document the versions of all three components (Helm chart, plug-ins, {PlatformNameShort}) to simplify future upgrades and troubleshooting.
