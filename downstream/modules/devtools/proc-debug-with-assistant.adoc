= Debug with the AI assistant

[role="_abstract"]
You can ask the AI assistant to analyze a playbook to identify why it is failing, or to find potential bugs.

.Procedure
. Open the playbook that you want to debug.
. In the GitHub Copilot chat window, enter a natural language prompt describing the situation. For example:
* _Analyze this playbook and explain why it might be failing_.
* _Run debugging analysis on this file_.
+
The AI assistant uses its embedded tools (such as static code analysis) to scan the playbook for common errors, logic gaps, or configuration mismatches.
+
The assistant then provides an explanation of the issue in natural language, translating technical error codes or anti-patterns into understandable and actionable information.
