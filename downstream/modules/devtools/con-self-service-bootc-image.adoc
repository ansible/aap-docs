= Understanding RHEL bootc image mode for {SelfService}

[role="_abstract"]

The `ansible.portal_installer` collection provides a role to build bootable disk images from Ansible {SelfService} `bootc` container images.

You can use the `bootc-image-builder` tool to generate images in the following formats:

* *QCOW2:* For use with KVM/libvirt and local virtualization.
* *ISO:* For bare-metal installations and bootable media.
* *Raw (AMI):* For creating AWS AMI images.
The build process configures users with SSH key authentication only. It embeds portal-related credentials and configuration directly into the image.
