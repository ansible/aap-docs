. Enter your {PlatformNameShort} credentials and click *Log in*. 
. The {SelfServiceShort} web console opens.

.Troubleshooting
If you are using custom or self-signed SSL certificates and when attempting to log in to {SelfServiceShort}, it displays the error:

`Login failed; caused by Error: Failed to send POST request: fetch failed`

This error indicates that {SelfServiceShort} cannot verify the SSL certificate from your {PlatformNameShort} instance.

To resolve this issue, configure {SelfServiceShort} to trust your custom CA certificate.
For more information, see xref:self-service-configure-custom-ssl_{context}[].

[NOTE]
====
While you can disable SSL validation by setting `checkSSL: false` in the Helm chart configuration, this approach is not recommended for production environments as it reduces security.
Instead, configure {SelfServiceShort} to trust your custom CA certificate.
