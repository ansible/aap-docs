[id="self-service-set-up-rbac_{context}"]
= Setting up RBAC for custom self-service templates

[role="_abstract"]
By default, {PlatformNameShort} administrators can define {SelfServiceShort} RBAC roles.

This procedure describes how to create a role in {SelfServiceShort} that allows only a selected team to view and execute particular custom self-service templates.

Custom self-service templates in {SelfServiceShort} are associated with job templates in {PlatformNameShort}.
This association is set in the `steps.actions` section of the YAML file for the custom self-service template. 

If you assign permissions to a particular team to launch a custom self-service template from {SelfServiceShort},
then you must make sure that that team has permission to run the associated job templates in {PlatformNameShort}.

See
link:{URLCentralAuth}/gw-managing-access#proc-controller-creating-a-user[Creating a user]
