= Verifying the disconnected installation

[role="_abstract"]
After the installation, follow the steps to verify the disconnected deployment by checking the Helm release status and monitoring the pods in your namespace using helm list and `oc` get pods, as well as inspecting pod events for errors and verify the creation of OpenShift routes.

.Procedure
. Check the Helm release status:
+
----
$ helm list -n ${MY_NAMESPACE}
----
. Monitor the pods in your namespace to ensure they are running:
+
----
$ oc get pods -n ${MY_NAMESPACE}
----
. Check for `ImagePullBackOff` or other errors in pod events:
+
----
$ oc describe pod <pod_name> -n ${MY_NAMESPACE}
----
. If the chart uses routes to expose services, verify that the routes are created and accessible:
+
----
$ oc get route -n ${MY_NAMESPACE}
----
