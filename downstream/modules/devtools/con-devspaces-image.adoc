{DevSpacesFull} is a containerized cloud development environment (CDE) that provides pre-configured, consistent workspaces running on {OCPShort}.
It provisions ready-to-code workspaces on demand.

The {AnsibleDevSpaces} image is the container image for {AnsibleWorkspaces}.
It replaces an existing Ansible demo within {DevSpacesShort} and is fully supported by Red Hat.
