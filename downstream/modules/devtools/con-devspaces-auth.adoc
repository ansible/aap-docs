= Authentication

{AnsibleDevSpaces} must be able to authenticate with your Git source control manager (SCM).

* If your organization has integrated Git source control OAuth authentication with {AnsibleDevSpaces},
you do not need to configure authentication between {DevSpacesShort} and your Git SCM.
* If your organization has not set up OAuth authentication, you must generate personal access tokens for authentication between {DevSpacesShort} and your Git SCM.
