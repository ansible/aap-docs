= Configure {ToolsName} with the AI assistant

[role="_abstract"]
After installing {ToolsName}, you can use the MCP server-enabled AI assistant in the Ansible {VSCode} extension to configure your workspace, including:

* Setting up a virtual environment.
* Installing specific Python versions.
* Adding Ansible collections.


.Procedure
. Open GitHub Copilot chat.
. In the chat window, enter a natural language prompt instructing the AI assistant to set up the configuration you want. For example:
+
_Set up a complete Ansible development environment with Python 3.11, and install the collections amazon.aws and ansible.posix_. 
+
The assistant triggers the `ade_setup_environment` tool, and the system automatically performs the following configuration steps: 

* Create a virtual environment: The assistant creates a virtual environment (`venv/`) in your workspace. 
* Install core tools: The assistant installs `ansible-core` and `ansible-lint` in the new virtual environment.
* Install collections: The assistant installs the requested collections (`amazon.aws`, `ansible.posix`) and their dependencies. 
* Check for conflicts: The assistant checks for conflicting packages and verifies `ansible-lint` status.
+
. Review the output in the Copilot chat. When setup is complete, the assistant confirms that the environment is set up, and gives instructions on activating the environment. For example: 
.. To activate, run `source <path>/venv/bin/activate`
.. To deactivate, run `deactivate`.

.Verification
Verify that configuration was successful by asking the AI assistant to check the environment status again. For example:

_Check my environment again to confirm that everything is set up correctly_.

The `ade_environment_info` tool runs and confirms the Python version, virtual environment path, and installed collections in its output.
