{SelfServiceShortStart} is built on Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH), which provides the web interface and plugin framework.
Your {PlatformNameShort} subscription includes the use of RHDH for the self-service portal without requiring a separate RHDH subscription.

RHDH provides the foundational features for the self-service portal, including:

* User authentication and authorization
* Plugin architecture for custom integrations
* Web interface components and navigation
* Template and catalog management

The self-service portal extends RHDH with {PlatformNameShort}-specific plugins that enable automation job execution, template synchronization, and integration with {PlatformNameShort} organizations and job templates.

For information about support policies and the lifecycle for {SelfServiceShort}, see _Supported platforms_.
