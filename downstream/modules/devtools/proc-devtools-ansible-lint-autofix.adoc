= Autofix

Ansible-lint provides an autofix feature that allows auto-fixing of some rule violations in Ansible files.

To reformat YAML files and run transform for the given rules, run the following command:

----
ansible-lint --fix [<write_list>]
----

Use the `write-list` to limit the rules that you want to auto-fix
by passing a keywords `all` or `none` or a comma separated list of rule ids or rule tags.

* `ansible-lint --fix ["all"]` (default) runs all transforms.
* `ansible-lint --fix ["none"]` disables all auto-fixes.
* `ansible-lint --fix ["csv-list-of-rules"]` enables a subset of rule transforms by listing rules/tags here.

The following rules allow autofix functionality.
