[id="build-ee-with-assistant_{context}"]
= Build the {ExecEnvShort} with the AI assistant

[role="_abstract"]
After you have created and validated the definition file, prompt the assistant for the specific commands to build the {ExecEnvShort} image.

.Prerequisites
* A container runtime like Podman is installed.
* The GitHub Copilot chat is active and your {ExecEnvShort} file is open.

.Procedure
. Prompt the assistant for build instructions. For example:
* _How do I build this execution environment? What are the next steps?_
+
This prompts the AI assistant to generate an `ansible-builder` command tailored to fit your file and tag.
+
. Copy the build command that was generated and run it in your {VSCode} terminal. An example command might look like this:
+
[source,python]
----
ansible-builder build --file execution-environment.yml --context ./context --tag webserver-ee:1.0 -vvv.
