= Understanding {PlatformNameShort} synchronization

[role="_abstract"]
The synchronization feature imports Organizations, Users, Teams, and Job Templates from {PlatformNameShort} into the {SelfService}. 
This process makes the {PlatformNameShort} entities securely discoverable and accessible to portal users.

== Overview

{SelfServiceShortStart} synchronizes two types of data from {PlatformNameShort}:

* Organizations, Users, and Teams: Identity and organizational structure data
* Job Templates: Executable automation templates

Both synchronizations run on a scheduled basis and can be manually triggered by {PlatformNameShort} Administrators in the portal UI.

== How it works

. The {SelfService} connects to your {PlatformNameShort} instance using configured credentials.
. The {SelfService} fetches data based on the configured {PlatformNameShort} Organization and filter criteria.
. The {SelfService} converts {PlatformNameShort} entities into portal entities and displays them in the UI.
. Synchronization runs on a configurable schedule (for example, every 60 minutes).
. Users access and launch resources based on their existing {PlatformNameShort} permissions.
