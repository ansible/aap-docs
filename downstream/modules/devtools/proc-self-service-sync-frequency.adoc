[id="self-service-sync-frequency_{context}"]
= Adjusting synchronization frequency between {PlatformNameShort} and {SelfServiceShort}

The Helm chart defines how frequently users,
teams and organization configuration information is synchronized from {PlatformNameShort} to {SelfServiceShort}. 

The frequency is set by the `catalog.providers.rhaap.schedule.frequency` key.
By default, the synchronization occurs hourly. 

* To adjust the synchronization frequency, edit the value for the `catalog.providers.rhaap.schedule.frequency` key in the Helm chart.

        catalog:
          ...
          providers:
            rhaap:
              '{{- include "catalog.providers.env" . }}':
                schedule:
                  frequency: {minutes: 60}
                  timeout: {seconds: 30}

[NOTE]
====
Increasing the synchronization frequency generates extra traffic.

Bear this in mind when deciding the frequency, particularly if you have a large number of users.
====

// To run a synchronization outside of the scheduled frequency, restart your {SelfServiceShort} instance.
