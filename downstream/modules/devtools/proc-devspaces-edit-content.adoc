= Editing and debugging automation content in your {AnsibleWorkspaceSing}

[role="_abstract"]
You can continue your work in a previously created workspace. Workspaces that have been inactive for a set period might be paused to free up resources. The duration of inactivity before timeout is configured in {DevSpacesShort} by your administrator. A paused workspace automatically relaunches when you select it from the {DevSpacesShort} dashboard. Ansible lint indicates errors in your playbooks.

.Procedure

. Select *Open* next to the workspace that you want to use.
. Select the *Explorer* icon in the *Activity* bar to open the file explorer, and open the file you want to edit.
. While you are editing, the Ansible extension provides suggestions. Select a suggestion from the dropdown list to include it in your playbook.

. Open the terminal in {VSCode}: click the main menu icon in the *Activity* bar and select menu:Terminal[New Terminal].
