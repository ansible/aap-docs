[id="implement-fixes-with-the-assistant_{context}"]
= Implement fixes with the AI assistant

[role="_abstract"]
After the AI assistant has generated a list of fixes, you can ask the assistant to help you implement those fixes. 

.Procedure
. Review the assistant's response. It should highlight sections of the code that have errors or that could be improved.
+
The analysis might include:

* Identification of Anti-patterns: Flagging inefficient or insecure practices.
* Failure Analysis: Explaining logical errors that could cause runtime failures.
* Best Practice Gaps: Noting where the code deviates from the "prescriptive rule sets" derived from Ansible content best practices.
+
. Prompt the assistant to provide a solution. For example:

* _How do I fix this error?_
* _Refactor this task to follow best practices._
+
The assistant generates a corrected code block, ensuring that it adheres to best practice recommendations (such as correct indentation, valid parameters, and proper module usage).

.Next steps
After applying the suggested changes, verify that there are no further issues.

. Apply the changes to your playbook.
. (Optional) Ask the assistant to confirm the new structure. For example, you can ask _Does this look correct now?_
+ 
The assistant might trigger `ansible_lint` again or perform a final static check to ensure the debugging session resolved the issues.
