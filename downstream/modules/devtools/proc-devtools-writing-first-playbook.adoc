= Writing your first playbook

[role="_abstract"]
Create your first Ansible playbook within {VSCode} using the Ansible extension. The tools available help ensure that your syntax is correct and ready to run.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed and opened the Ansible {VSCode} extension. 
* You have opened a terminal in {VSCode}.
* You have installed `ansible-devtools`.

.Procedure

. Create a new .yml file in {VSCode} for your playbook, for example `example_playbook.yml`. Put it in the same directory level as the example `site.yml` file.
. Add the following example code into the playbook file and save the file.
The playbook consists of a single play that executes a `ping` to your local machine. 
+
----
---
- name: My first play
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Ping my hosts
      ansible.builtin.ping:

----
+
`Ansible-lint` runs in the background and displays errors in the *Problems* tab of the terminal.
There are no errors in this playbook:

. If you want to add new content to the playbook, use the following rules:
** Every playbook file must finish with a blank line.
** Trailing spaces at the end of lines are not allowed.
** Every playbook and every play require an identifier (name).
. Save your playbook file.
