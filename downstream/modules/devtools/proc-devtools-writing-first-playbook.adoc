= Writing your first playbook

[role="_abstract"]
The instructions below describe how {ToolsName} help you to create and run your first playbook in {VSCode}.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed and opened the Ansible {VSCode} extension. 
* You have opened a terminal in {VSCode}.
* You have installed `ansible-devtools`.

.Procedure

. Create a new .yml file in {VSCode} for your playbook, for example `example_playbook.yml`. Put it in the same directory level as the example `site.yml` file.
. Add the following example code into the playbook file and save the file.
The playbook consists of a single play that executes a `ping` to your local machine.
