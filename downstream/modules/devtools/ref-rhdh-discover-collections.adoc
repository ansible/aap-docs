From the *Overview* page in the Ansible plug-ins dashboard on {RHDH}, click *Discover Existing Collections*.

The links in this pane provide access to the source of reusable automation content collections that you configured during plug-in installation. 

If you configured {PrivateHubName} when installing the plug-in, you can click *Go to Automation Hub* to view the collections and {ExecEnvShort}s that your enterprise has curated. 

If you did not configure a {PrivateHubName} URL when installing the plug-in, the *Discover existing collection* pane provides a link to Red Hat {HubName} on console.redhat.com.
You can explore certified and validated Ansible content collections on this site.
