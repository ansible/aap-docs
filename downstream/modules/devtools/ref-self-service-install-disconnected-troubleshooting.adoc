|Symptom
|Cause
|Solution

|`authentication required` or `unauthorized` in `install-dynamic-plugins` init container logs
|Auth secret missing or malformed. The init container uses `skopeo` and does not use cluster pull secrets.
|Create `<release-name>-dynamic-plugins-registry-auth` secret. Use `base64 -w0` to avoid multiline values that corrupt `auth.json`.

|Duplicate path in OCI URL (for example, `.../ansible-automation-platform/ansible-automation-platform/...`)
|`imageRegistry` includes a repository path instead of the registry host only.
|Set `imageRegistry` to the registry host only. If your mirror uses a different repository structure, use `ociPluginImage` to set the full image path.

|`x509: certificate signed by unknown authority` in init container logs
|Private registry uses a self-signed or internal CA certificate.
|Mount the CA certificate into the init container. See xref:self-service-install-disconnected-configure-ca-certs_self-service-disconnected-install-helm-chart[Configure CA certificates for private registries].
