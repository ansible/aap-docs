= Running your playbook

[role="_abstract"]

The Ansible {VSCode} extension provides two options to run your playbook:

* `ansible-playbook` runs the playbook on your local machine using Ansible Core.
* `ansible-navigator` runs the playbook in an execution environment in the same manner that {PlatformNameShort} runs an automation job.
You specify the base image for the execution environment in the Ansible extension settings.

== Running your playbook with `ansible-playbook`

.Procedure

* To run a playbook, right-click the playbook name in the Explorer pane, then select menu:Run Ansible Playbook via[Run playbook via `ansible-playbook`].

The output is displayed in the *Terminal* tab of the {VSCode} terminal.
The `ok=2` and `failed=0` messages indicate that the playbook ran successfully.
