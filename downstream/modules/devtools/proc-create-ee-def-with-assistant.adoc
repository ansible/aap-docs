[id="create-ee-with-assistant_{context}"]
= Create an {ExecEnvShort} definition file with the AI assistant

[role="_abstract"]
To create an {ExecEnvShort}, first prompt the AI assistant to generate a definition file that defines the environment.

.Procedure
. Enter a prompt describing your {ExecEnvShort} requirements in the Copilot chat window. For example:
* _Create an {ExecEnvShort} definition file. Use `ee-minimal` as the base, include `ansible.builtin` and the `community.general` collection, add git as a system package, and tag it as `webserver-ee:1.0`_
+
In response, the assistant triggers the `define_and_build_execution_env tool` to formulate a prompt using your requirements and the internal `ee-rules.md` resource.
+
[NOTE]

====
No file is created in this step. The assistant prepares the context for accurate YAML generation.
====
+
. Instruct the assistant to create the {ExecEnvShort} file. For example: 
* _Generate the execution-environment.yml content based on the prompt you received_.
+
The assistant then calls the tool again, this time with the `generatedYaml` parameter. The tool validates the generated YAML against the {ExecEnvShort}schema.

.Verification
If successful, the assistant confirms the creation of `execution-environment.yml` and displays the validation status.
