[role="_abstract"]

You can view the automation execution environments provided by Red Hat in the
link:https://catalog.redhat.com/search?searchType=containers&build_categories_list=Automation%20execution%20environment&p=1[Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog].

Click on an execution environment for information on how to download it.

For example, to download the minimal RHEL 8 base image, run the following command:
----
$ podman pull registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-25/ee-minimal-rhel9
----

You can build and create custom execution environments with `ansible-builder`.
For more information about working with execution environments locally, see
link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/creating_and_consuming_execution_environments/index[_Creating and consuming execution environments_].

After customizing your execution environment, you can push your new image to the container registry in automation hub. See
link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html-single/creating_and_consuming_execution_environments/index#assembly-publishing-exec-env[Publishing an automation execution environment]
in the _Creating and consuming execution environments_ documentation.
