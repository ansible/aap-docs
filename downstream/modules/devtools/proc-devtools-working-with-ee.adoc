[NOTE]
====
If you are running {ToolsName} on a container inside {VSCode} and you want to pull execution environments
or the `devcontainer` to use as an execution environment,
you must log in to `registry.redhat.io` from a terminal prompt within the `devcontainer` inside {VSCode}.
====
. Using the information in the 
link:https://catalog.redhat.com/search?searchType=containers&build_categories_list=Automation%20execution%20environment&p=1[Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog], download the execution environment you need.
+
For example, to download the minimal RHEL 8 base image, run the following command:
+
----
$ podman pull registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-25/ee-minimal-rhel9
----

You can build and create custom execution environments with `ansible-builder`.
For more information about working with execution environments locally, see
link:{LinkBuilder}.

After customizing your execution environment, you can push your new image to the container registry in automation hub. See
link:{URLBuilder}/index#assembly-publishing-exec-env[Publishing an automation execution environment]
