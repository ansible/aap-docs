= Configuring Role Based Access Control

[role="_abstract"]
{RHDH} offers Role-based Access Control (RBAC) functionality.
RBAC can then be applied to the Ansible plug-ins content. 

Assign the following roles:

* Members of the `admin:superUsers` group can select templates in the *Create* tab of the Ansible plug-ins to create playbook and collection projects.
* Members of the `admin:users` group can view templates in the *Create* tab of the Ansible plug-ins.

The following example adds RBAC to {RHDH}.

data:
  app-config-rhdh.yaml: |

      enabled: true
      rbac:
        admin:
          users:
            - name: user:default/<user-scm-ida>
          superUsers:
            - name: user:default/<user-admin-idb>
