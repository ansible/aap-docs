= Configuring OpenShift Dev Spaces

When OpenShift Dev Spaces is configured for the Ansible plug-ins, users can click a link from the catalog item view in {RHDH} and edit their provisioned Ansible Git projects using Dev Spaces. 

[NOTE]
====
OpenShift Dev Spaces is a separate product and it is optional.
The plug-ins will function without it.

It is a separate Red Hat product and is not included in the {PlatformNameShort} or {RHDH} subscription.

If the OpenShift Dev Spaces link is not configured in the Ansible plug-ins, the *Go to OpenShift Dev Spaces dashboard* link in the *4.DEVELOP* section of the Ansible plug-ins landing page redirects users to the
