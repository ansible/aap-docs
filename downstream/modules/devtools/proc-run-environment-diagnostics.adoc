. Open GitHub Copilot Chat.
. Enter a prompt in natural language asking the AI assistant what is installed in your environment. For example:

.. _What collections are installed_? 
+
The assistant then triggers the `ade_environment_info` tool.
+
. Review the output, which typically includes:
.. Workspace path and Python version
.. Virtual environment status
.. {PlatformNameShort} and `ansible_lint` versions
.. A list of installed collections
.. The installation status of {ToolsName} (ADT).
