= Running ansible-lint from the command line

To run {LintName} from the command, use the `ansible-lint` command. 
Pass the files that you want to lint as arguments to
the `ansible-lint` command. For example, to lint
`example_playbook1.yml` and `example_playbook2.yml`, use the
following command:

----
$ ansible-lint path/to/example_playbook1.yml path/to/example_playbook2.yml
----

Run `ansible-lint --help` to display the command options for {LintName}.

// Ansible-lint recommends following the
// https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/devel/dev_guide/developing_collections_structure.html#collection-structure[collection
// structure layout] whether you plan to build a collection or not.
// 
// Following that layout assures the best integration with all ecosystem
// tools because it helps those tools better distinguish between random
// YAML files and files managed by Ansible. When you call `ansible-lint`
// without arguments, it uses internal heuristics to determine file types.


// == Running example playbooks
// 
// Ansible-lint includes an `ansible-lint/examples` folder that contains
// example playbooks with different rule violations and undesirable
// characteristics. You can run `ansible-lint` on the example playbooks
// to observe Ansible-lint in action, as follows:
// 
// ----
// $ ansible-lint --offline -p examples/playbooks/example.yml
// ----

{LintName} also handles playbooks that include other playbooks, tasks,
handlers, or roles.
// 
// ----
// $ ansible-lint --offline -q -p examples/playbooks/include.yml
// ----
