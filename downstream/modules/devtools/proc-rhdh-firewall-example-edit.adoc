= Editing your firewall playbook project

The Ansible plug-ins integrate OpenShift Dev Spaces to edit your Ansible projects.
OpenShift Dev Spaces provides on-demand, web-based Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).

Ansible Git projects provisioned using the Ansible plug-ins include best practice configurations for OpenShift Dev Spaces.
These configurations include installing the Ansible VS Code extension and providing access from the IDE terminal to Ansible development tools,
such as Ansible Navigator and Ansible Lint.

[NOTE]
====
OpenShift Dev Spaces is optional and it is not required to run the Ansible plug-ins.
It is a separate Red Hat product and it is not included in the {PlatformNameShort} or {RHDH} subscription.
====

This example assumes that OpenShift Dev Spaces has been configured in the Ansible plug-ins installation.

.Procedure

* In the *catalog item* view of your playbook project, click *Open Ansible project in OpenShift Dev Spaces*.
+
A VS Code instance of OpenShift Dev Spaces opens in a new browser tab.
It automatically loads your new Ansible Playbook Git project.
