= Troubleshooting {PlatformNameShort} synchronization

[role="_abstract"]
Review common issues, symptoms, and solutions if synchronization does not function as expected.


== No Job Templates appearing in portal

**Issue:** Expected Job Templates are missing from the portal interface.

**Solutions:**

* Verify the `surveyEnabled` setting in your Helm values file matches the status of your Job Templates.
* Confirm the `labels` filter includes the correct, approved {PlatformNameShort} Label names.
* Try temporarily removing filters to confirm if the Job Templates appear without restrictions.
* Verify the {PlatformNameShort} Organization name spelling is exact (it is case-sensitive).
* Check {PlatformNameShort} connectivity and the configured token permissions.

== No Users or Teams appearing in portal

**Issue:** Expected users or teams are missing from the portal interface.

**Solutions:**

* Check {PlatformNameShort} connectivity and the configured token permissions.
* Verify the {PlatformNameShort} Organization name matches exactly.
* Review the configured synchronization schedule and check system logs.
* Ensure users have the proper organization or team memberships within {PlatformNameShort}.

== Slow synchronization

**Issue:** Synchronization takes too long to complete or times out.

**Symptoms:**

* Timeouts during synchronization.
* Timeout errors appear in the logs.

**Solutions:**

* Increase the `timeout` value in the synchronization schedule.
* Reduce the synchronization `frequency` (sync less often).
* Add more specific filters to the Job Templates configuration to reduce the overall count of entities processed.
* For large organizations, increase the `timeout` specifically for the identity sync (`orgsUsersTeams`).

== Wrong {PlatformNameShort} organization

**Issue:** The portal displays unexpected Job Templates, users, or teams.

**Symptoms:**

* Expected Job Templates do not appear.
* Incorrect templates appear.
* Users or teams are missing, or the wrong ones are present.

**Solutions:**

* Verify the {PlatformNameShort} Organization name spelling is exact (it is case-sensitive).
* Check the organization names in {PlatformNameShort} itself.
* Ensure the configured organization exists in {PlatformNameShort}.
