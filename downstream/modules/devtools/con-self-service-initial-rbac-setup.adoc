= Setting up initial RBAC rules in {SelfServiceShort}

[role="_abstract"]
After you install {SelfServiceShort} and synchronize it with {PlatformNameShort},
only users with {PlatformNameShort} administrator privileges can view the auto-generated templates.

You must configure initial Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions to allow non-admin users to view and execute synchronized {PlatformNameShort} job templates.
