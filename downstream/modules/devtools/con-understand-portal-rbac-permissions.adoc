= Understanding the permission model

[role="_abstract"]
{SelfServiceShortStart} and {PlatformNameShort} use separate but related permission systems. 
{PlatformNameShort} RBAC is the source of truth for synchronization scope and execution permissions.

**{SelfServiceShortStart} RBAC:**

* Controls which users can view templates in the {SelfService} catalog.
* Controls which users can access portal templates and submit jobs.

**{PlatformNameShort} RBAC:**

* **Controls synchronization scope:** Only {PlatformNameShort} job templates accessible by the configured {PlatformNameShort} token (ansible.rhaap.token) are synchronized to {SelfService}.
* **Controls {PlatformNameShort} job template visibility and execution:** {PlatformNameShort} permissions determine whether authenticated users can view and execute {PlatformNameShort} job templates in {SelfService}.
* **Validates execution permissions:** When a {SelfService} user executes a template, {PlatformNameShort} checks that user's execute permissions before launching the job.

[NOTE]
====
If a user can see a {SelfService} template in the catalog but lacks {PlatformNameShort} execution permissions for the associated {PlatformNameShort} job template in {PlatformNameShort}, the user cannot run the {PlatformNameShort} Job.
