= Excluding ansible-lint rules

To exclude specific rules from being applied when linting a playbook, use the `-x` flag.
This is useful if you want to temporarily disable certain rules without modifying your configuration file.

The following example lints a file but skips the checks for YAML formatting rules and tabs:

----
ansible-lint -x no-tabs -x yaml <filename.yml>
----
