= Creating an OAuth application

To use the Helm chart to deploy {SelfServiceShort}, you must have set up an OAuth application on your {PlatformNameShort} instance.
However, you cannot run automation on your {PlatformNameShort} instance until you have deployed your {SelfServiceShort} Helm chart,
because the OAuth configuration requires the URL for your deployment.

Create the OAuth Application on your {PlatformNameShort} instance,
using a placeholder name for the deployment URL. 

After deploying {SelfServiceShort}, you must xref:self-service-add-deployment-url-oauth-app_self-service-accessing-deployment[replace the placeholder value with a URL derived from your deployment URL] in your OAuth application.

The steps below describe how to create an OAuth Application in the {PlatformNameShort} Platform console. 

.Procedure
. Open your {PlatformNameShort} instance in a browser and log in.
. Navigate to {MenuAMAdminOauthApps}.
. Click *Create OAuth Application*.
. Complete the fields in the form,
adding a placeholder text (for example `http:example.com`) in the *Redirect URIs* field:

. Click *Create OAuth application*.
+
The *Application information* popup displays the `clientId` and `clientSecret` values.
. Copy the `clientId` and `clientSecret` values and save them.
+
These values are used in an OpenShift secret for {PlatformNameShort} authentication.
