= Creating an OAuth application

To use the Helm chart to deploy {SelfServiceShort}, you must have set up an OAuth application on your {PlatformNameShort} instance.
However, you cannot run automation on your {PlatformNameShort} instance until you have deployed your {SelfServiceShort} Helm chart,
because the OAuth configuration requires the URL for your deployment.

Create the OAuth Application on your {PlatformNameShort} instance,
using a placeholder name for the deployment URL. 

After deploying {SelfServiceShort}, you must
link:{URLSelfServiceInstall}/self-service-accessing-deployment_aap-self-service-install#self-service-add-deployment-url-oauth-app_self-service-accessing-deployment[replace the placeholder value with a URL derived from your deployment URL]
in your OAuth application.

The steps below describe how to create an OAuth Application in the {PlatformNameShort} Platform console. 

.Procedure
. Open your {PlatformNameShort} instance in a browser and log in.
. Navigate to {MenuAMAdminOauthApps}.
. Click *Create OAuth Application*.
. Complete the fields in the form.
** *Name*: Add a name for your application.
** *Organization*: Choose the organization.
** *Authorization grant type*: Choose `Authorization code`.
** *Client type*: choose `Confidential`.
** *Redirect URIs*: Add placeholder text for the deployment URL (for example `https//:example.com`).

These values are used in an OpenShift secret for {PlatformNameShort} authentication.
