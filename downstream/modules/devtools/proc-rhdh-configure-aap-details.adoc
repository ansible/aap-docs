[id="rhdh-configure-aap-details_{context}"]
= Configuring Ansible Automation Platform details

The Ansible plug-ins query your {PlatformNameShort} subscription status with the controller API using a token.

[NOTE]
====
The Ansible plug-ins continue to function regardless of the {PlatformNameShort} subscription status.
====

.Procedure

. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with “Read” scope in automation controller, following the
link:{URLCentralAuth}/gw-token-based-authentication#assembly-controller-applications[Applications]
section of _{TitleCentralAuth}_. 
. Edit your custom {RHDH} config map, for example `app-config-rhdh`.
. Add your {PlatformNameShort} details to `app-config-rhdh.yaml`.
..  Set the `baseURL` key with your automation controller URL.
..  Set the `token` key with the generated token value that you created in Step 1.
..  Set the `checkSSL` key to `true` or `false`. 
+
If `checkSSL` is set to `true`, the Ansible plug-ins verify whether the SSL certificate is valid.

[NOTE]
====
You are responsible for protecting your {RHDH} installation from external and unauthorized access.
Manage the backend authentication key like any other secret.
Meet strong password requirements, do not expose it in any configuration files, and only inject it into configuration files as an environment variable.
