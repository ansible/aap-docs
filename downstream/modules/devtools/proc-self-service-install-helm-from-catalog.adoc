. Search for `Portal` in the Helm Charts filter,
and select the `Automation Portal` chart.

. Select the *YAML view* in the *Create Helm Release* page.
. Locate the `clusterRouterBase` key in the YAML file and replace the placeholder value with the base URL of your OpenShift instance.

for example `apps.example.com`:
