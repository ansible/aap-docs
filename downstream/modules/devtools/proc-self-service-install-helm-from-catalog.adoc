= Configure the {SelfServiceShort} Helm chart from the OpenShift catalog

[role="_abstract"]
Deploy the Helm chart from the OpenShift catalog by configuring the base URL and organization name in the YAML view. This launches the self-service automation portal installation.

.Prerequisites
* You have created a project for {SelfServiceShort} in {OCPShort}.
* You have created secrets in {OCPShort} for {PlatformNameShort} authentication.
* If you configure SCM integration (for example, importing from private repositories or using templates that access SCM), you have created secrets in OpenShift for SCM authentication.
* You have completed one of the plug-in delivery methods outlined in the link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{Platformvers}/html-single/installing_self-service_automation_portal/index#self-service-create-ocp-registry_self-service-preinstall-config[Choose a plug-in delivery method] section:
** For OCI delivery: You have created the `<release-name>-dynamic-plugins-registry-auth` secret.
** For HTTP plug-in registry: You have deployed the plug-in registry.




.Procedure
. In the {OCPShort} web console, select the *Developer* view.
. Select your project and click the btn:[Helm] option in the OpenShift sidebar.  
. Click btn:[Create] and select *Helm Release*. 
. Search for `Portal` in the Helm Charts filter, and select the `Automation Portal` chart. 
. Click btn:[Create] and select the *YAML view*.
. Set the OpenShift cluster router base.
. Update the `clusterRouterBase` value with the base URL of your OpenShift instance.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must replace the default `apps.example.com` placeholder value. If the default value remains, Helm chart validation fails.
