= About {LintName}

{LintName} (`ansible-lint`) is a linter specifically designed for Ansible playbooks and roles.

{LintName} flags syntax and programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.
It also ensures that your Ansible files follow standard practices so that content created by different people has a similar look and feel. 

{LintName} checks your roles and playbooks against a set of rules.

Profiles are predefined groups of these rules that configure how ansible-lint runs in different scenarios.
For example, the `basic` profile uses fewer rules and is therefore less strict than the `production` profile.

You can set the profile you want to use, as well as other preferences for {LintName}, in the `.ansible-lint.yml` configuration file.

You can view reports about your playbook and roles files in the terminal in {VSCode}, or you can run `ansible-lint` commands from the command line.
