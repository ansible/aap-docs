= Running your playbook

[role="_abstract"]

The Ansible {VSCode} extension provides two options to run your playbook:

* `ansible-playbook` runs the playbook on your local machine using Ansible Core.
* `ansible-navigator` runs the playbook in an execution environment in the same manner that {PlatformNameShort} runs an automation job.
You specify the base image for the execution environment in the Ansible extension settings.
