= Running your playbook

[role="_abstract"]
Run your playbook using two methods provided by the Ansible {VSCode} extension.

.Procedure
* The Ansible {VSCode} extension provides two options to run your playbook:

** `ansible-playbook` runs the playbook on your local machine using Ansible Core.
** `ansible-navigator` runs the playbook in an execution environment in the same manner that {PlatformNameShort} runs an automation job.
You specify the base image for the execution environment in the Ansible extension settings.
