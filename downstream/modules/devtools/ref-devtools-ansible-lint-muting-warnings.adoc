= Muting warnings to avoid false positives

Not all linting rules are precise. Some are general rules.
Advanced `git`, `yum` or `apt` usage, for example, can incorrectly
trigger {LintName} rule violations.

To disable rule violations for specific tasks in a playbook, and mute false positives,
add `# noqa: [rule_id]` to the end of the line.
Add a comment that explains why the rules are disabled.

You can add the `# noqa: [rule_id]` comment to the end of any line in
a task. You can also skip multiple rules with a space-separated list.

----
- name: This task would typically fire git-latest and partial-become rules
  become_user: alice # noqa: git-latest partial-become
  ansible.builtin.git: src=/path/to/git/repo dest=checkout
----

If the rule is line-based, `# noqa: [rule_id]` must be at the end of
the line.

----
- name: This would typically fire jinja[spacing]
  get_url:
    url: http://example.com/file.conf
    dest: "{{dest_proj_path}}/foo.conf" # noqa: jinja[spacing]
----

If you want Ansible-lint to skip a rule entirely, use the `-x` command
line argument or add it to `skip_list` in your configuration.

The least preferred method of skipping rules is to skip all task-based
rules for a task, which does not skip line-based rules. You can use the
`skip_ansible_lint` tag with all tasks, for example:

----
- name: This would typically fire no-free-form
  command: warn=no chmod 644 X

- name: This would typically fire git-latest
  git: src=/path/to/git/repo dest=checkout
  tags:
    - skip_ansible_lint
