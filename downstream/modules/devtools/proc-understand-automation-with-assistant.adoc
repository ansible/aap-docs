= Understand your existing automation with the AI assistant

[role="_abstract"]
If you are working with an existing playbook and need to understand its components, you can ask the assistant to analyze the file.

.Procedure
. Open the playbook you want to investigate in the {VSCode} editor.
. In the Copilot chat window, enter a prompt instructing the AI assistant to analyze dependencies. For example:
*  _Analyze my web server playbook and tell me which Ansible collections are being used_.
+
The assistant then analyzes the playbook content and identifies:

* Which collections are required.
* Which modules are used within the tasks.
* Whether automations are referenced with Fully Qualified Collection Names (FQCN).
