= Understanding the AMI build process

[role="_abstract"]

The `ansible.portal_installer` collection creates AMI-compatible images in two stages:

. *Local Build:* The role builds a raw disk image locally using `bootc-image-builder`. This step does _not_ require AWS credentials.
. *Conversion and Upload:* You must manually convert the raw image and upload it to AWS using the AWS CLI.
The resulting image uses the same `bootc` container source as other image formats but is formatted specifically for AWS EC2 compatibility.
