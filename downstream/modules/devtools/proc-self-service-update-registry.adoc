= Updating the plug-in registry

[role="_abstract"]
Update the plug-in registry build using the `oc start-build` command and the downloaded TAR files. This makes the new version of the plug-ins available for the Helm chart upgrade.

.Prerequisites
* You have downloaded the plug-in TAR files for {SelfService}.
* You have set an environment variable, for example `$DYNAMIC_PLUGIN_ROOT_DIR`,
to represent the path to the local directory where you have stored the TAR files.

.Procedure

. In a terminal, log in to your {OCPShort} instance.
. Open your OpenShift project for {SelfServiceShort}.
+
----
$ oc project <YOUR_SELF_SERVICE_AUTOMATION_PORTAL_PROJECT>
----
. Run the following commands to update your plug-in registry build in in your OpenShift project.
+
The command assumes that `$DYNAMIC_PLUGIN_ROOT_DIR` represents the directory for your TAR files.
Replace this in the command if you have chosen a different environment variable name.
+
----
$ oc start-build plugin-registry --from-dir=$DYNAMIC_PLUGIN_ROOT_DIR --wait
----
+
When the build starts, the following message is displayed:
+
----
 Uploading directory "/path/to/dynamic_plugin_root" as binary input for the build ...
 Uploading finished
----

.Verification

. Open the *Topology* view in the *Developer* perspective for your project in the OpenShift web console.
