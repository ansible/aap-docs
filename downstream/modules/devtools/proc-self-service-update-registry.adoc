= Update the plug-in registry

[role="_abstract"]
To update the plug-in registry, you must upload your plug-in files to OpenShift,
and start a new build of the registry.

.Prerequisites
* You have downloaded the plug-in TAR files for {SelfService}.
* You have set an environment variable, for example `$DYNAMIC_PLUGIN_ROOT_DIR`,
to represent the path to the local directory where you have stored the TAR files.

.Procedure

. In a terminal, log in to your {OCPShort} instance.
. Open your OpenShift project for {SelfServiceShort}.
+
----
$ oc project <YOUR_SELF_SERVICE_AUTOMATION_PORTAL_PROJECT>
----
. Find the name of your current plug-in registry build configuration:
+
----
$ oc get buildconfig
----
. From the output, identify the correct build configuration name, for example `aap-self-service-plugins`.
. Run the following command to start a new build in in your OpenShift project.
+
----
$ oc start-build <build_config_name> --from-dir=$DYNAMIC_PLUGIN_ROOT_DIR --wait
----
+
--
** The command assumes that `$DYNAMIC_PLUGIN_ROOT_DIR` represents the directory for your TAR files.
Replace this in the command if you have chosen a different environment variable name.
** Replace `<build_config_name>` with the build configuration name you identified.
--
+
When the build starts, the following message is displayed:
+
----
 Uploading directory "/path/to/dynamic_plugin_root" as binary input for the build ...
 Uploading finished
----

.Verification

. Open the *Topology* view in the *Developer* perspective for your project in the OpenShift web console.
. Select the plugin registry icon to open the *plugin-registry* details pane.
. In the *Pods* section of the *plugin-registry* details pane, select *View logs* for the
new build pod.
The format for the pod name is `<build_config_name>-<build_number>-build`.
