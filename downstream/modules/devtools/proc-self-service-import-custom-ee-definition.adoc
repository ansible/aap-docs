= Importing your custom EE definition

[role="_abstract"]

The EE definition workflow generates a reusable Backstage software template, named `<ee-name>-template.yaml`. This template includes the specified default configurations when you select **Publish to a Git repository** during the creation of your custom EE definition. 

The template is also generated for non-SCM based publishings.

You can import this template into the {SelfServiceShort} to make the default configuration available to others.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed the {SelfServiceShort}.
* You have the EE Builder feature enabled.
* You have a custom EE definition hosted in a repository.

.Procedure
. Go to the repository where your `<ee-name>-template.yaml` is stored and open it.
. Copy the URL of the **template.yaml** page.
. Log into the {SelfServiceShort} and select **EE definition files** from the lefthand navigation pane.
. Click **Create** > **Add Template**.
. Paste the template URL into the **Select URL** field and click **Analyze**.
. Click **Import**.

.Verification
To verify your template was added successfully, go to **EE definition files** > **Create**. Here you should see your newly created custom template.
