In the build stage, you create a new playbook project within a virtual environment, using {VSCode}. The following is a typical workflow:

. Install and run the Ansible extension in {VSCode}.
. Create or open a workspace for your playbooks directory in {VSCode}.
. Create and activate a Python virtual environment for your workspace and select it in {VSCode}.
. Scaffold a playbook project from {VSCode}.
. Add the collection names that your playbook uses to the requirements file.
// . Use ansible-dev-environment to create a virtual environment for your project. This installs any dependencies from the requirements file.
. Edit your playbook. Ansible-lint suggests corrections.
. Add roles in the roles directory.
. Create an execution environment that reflects the environment that {PlatformNameShort} uses.
. Run your playbooks from the Ansible extension.
// . As you develop your playbooks and roles, you can incorporate new dependencies into your virtual environment by re-running ansible-dev-environment.
// . Use `molecule` to test your playbooks. Create one scenario for every playbook in your project.
