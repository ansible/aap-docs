= Scaffolding a playbook project

[role="_abstract"]

The following steps describe the process for scaffolding a new playbook project with the Ansible {VSCode} extension.

. Prerequisites

* You have installed {ToolsName}.
* You have installed and opened the Ansible {VSCode} extension. 
* You have identified a directory where you want to save the project. 
// * You have set up and activated a Python virtual environment in {VSCode}.

.Procedure

. Open {VSCode}.
. Click the Ansible icon in the {VSCode} activity bar to open the Ansible extension.
. Select *Get started* in the *Ansible content creator* section.
+
The *Ansible content creator* tab opens.
. In the *Create* section, click *Ansible playbook project*.
+
The *Create Ansible project* tab opens. 
. In the form in the *Create Ansible project* tab, enter the following:
+
* *Destination directory*: Enter the path to the directory where you want to scaffold your new playbook project. 
+
[NOTE]
====
If you enter an existing directory name, the scaffolding process overwrites the contents of that directory.
The scaffold process only allows you to use an existing directory if you enable the `Force` option.
====
** If you are using the containerized version of Ansible Dev tools, the destination directory path is relative to the container, not a path in your local system. To discover the current directory name in the container, run the `pwd` command in a terminal in VS Code. If the current directory in the container is `workspaces`, enter `workspaces/<destination_directory_name>`.
** If you are using a locally installed version of Ansible Dev tools, enter the full path to the directory, for example `/user/<username>/projects/<destination_directory_name>`.
* *SCM organization and SCM project*: Enter a name for the directory and subdirectory where you can store roles that you create for your playbooks. 
. Enter a name for the directory where you want to scaffold your new playbook project. 
 
.Verification

After the project directory has been created, the following message appears in the *Logs* pane of the *Create Ansible Project* tab.
In this example, the destination directory name is `destination_directory_name`.
