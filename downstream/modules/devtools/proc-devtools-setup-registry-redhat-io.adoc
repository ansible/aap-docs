= Authenticating with the Red Hat container registry

[role="_abstract"]
All container images available through the Red Hat container catalog are hosted on an image registry,
`registry.redhat.io`.
The registry requires authentication for access to images.

To use the `registry.redhat.io` registry, you must have a Red Hat login.
This is the same account that you use to log in to the Red Hat Customer Portal (access.redhat.com) and manage your Red Hat subscriptions.

[NOTE]
====
If you are planning to install the {ToolsName} on a container inside {VSCode},
you must log in to `registry.redhat.io` before launching {VSCode} so that {VSCode} can pull the
`devtools` container from `registry.redhat.io`.

If you are running {ToolsName} on a container inside {VSCode} and you want to pull execution environments
or the `devcontainer` to use as an execution environment,
you must log in from a terminal prompt within the `devcontainer` from a terminal inside {VSCode}.
====

You can use the `podman login` or `docker login` commands with your credentials to access content on the registry.

Podman::

----
$ podman login registry.redhat.io
Username: my__redhat_username
Password: ***********
----
Docker::
+
----
$ docker login registry.redhat.io
Username: my__redhat_username
