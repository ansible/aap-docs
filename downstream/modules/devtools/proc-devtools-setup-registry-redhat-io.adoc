= Authenticating with the Red Hat container registry

[role="_abstract"]
All container images available through the Red Hat container catalog are hosted on an image registry,
`registry.redhat.io`.
The registry requires authentication for access to images.

[NOTE]
====
If you are planning to install the {ToolsName} on a container inside {VSCode},
you must log in to `registry.redhat.io` before launching {VSCode} so that {VSCode} can pull the
`devtools` container from `registry.redhat.io`.

If you are running {ToolsName} on a container inside {VSCode} and you want to pull execution environments
or the `devcontainer` to use as an execution environment,
you must log in from a terminal prompt within the `devcontainer` from a terminal inside {VSCode}.
