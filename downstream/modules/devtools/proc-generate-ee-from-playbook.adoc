[id="generate-ee-from-playbook_{context}"]
= Generate an {ExecEnvShort} from an existing playbook

[role="_abstract"]
Prompt the AI assistant to inspect an existing playbook to determine the necessary collections and dependencies for a new {ExecEnvShort} based on the playbook.

.Procedure
. Open the playbook you want to analyze in the {VSCode} editor.
. In the Copilot chat window, prompt the assistant to analyze the playbook. For example:

* _Analyze my current playbook, determine the necessary collections, and generate an {ExecEnvShort} definition file that includes them_.
. Review the output and confirm that the assistant has imported collections (for example, `community.general`, `amazon.aws`) required by the tasks in your playbook.
