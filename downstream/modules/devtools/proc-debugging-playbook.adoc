= Debugging your playbook

[role="_abstract"]
The Ansible extension  provides syntax highlighting and assists you with indentation in `.yml` files.

The following rules apply for playbook files:

* Every playbook file must finish with a blank line.
* Trailing spaces at the end of lines are not allowed.
* Every playbook and every play require an identifier (name).

== Inline help

* If you hover your mouse over a keyword or a module name, the Ansible extension provides documentation:

* If you begin to type the name of a module, for example `ansible.builtin.ping`, the extension provides a list of suggestions.
Select one of the suggestions to autocomplete the line.
