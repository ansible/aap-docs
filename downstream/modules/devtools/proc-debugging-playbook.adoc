= Debugging with ansible-lint in {VSCode}

When the Ansible extension is running in {VSCode}, ansible-lint runs in the background.
Diagnostics information for files whose language is identified as Ansible is displayed in the *Problems* tab of the terminal.

{LintName} loads configuration from the `.ansible-lint.yml` configuration file in the `.config` directory of your project workspace.
For example, you can specify strict linting rules for production, or less strict rules in the development phase.

For information about customizing the configuration file, see xref:devtools-ansible-lint-customize_devtools-ansible-lint[Customizing {LintName}].
