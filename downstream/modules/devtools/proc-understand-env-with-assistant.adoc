= Understand your local environment with the AI asistant

[role="_abstract"]
You can ask the AI assistant to list the automations (collections and tools) available in your local environment. This way, you can verify which tools are available to you before starting development.

.Procedure
. In the GitHub Copilot chat window, enter a natural language prompt to check the environment. For example:
*  _Check my Ansible environment and tell me what's installed._
*  _What collections are installed?_
+
The assistant then triggers the `ade_environment_info` tool.
+
. Review the output, which displays:
.. Ansible version
.. `ansible_lint` version
.. Installed collections
.. Python environment details
