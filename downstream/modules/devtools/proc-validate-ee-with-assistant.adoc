= Validate an {ExecEnvShort} definition file using the AI assistant

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the AI assistant to validate an existing {ExecEnvShort} definition file against the schema and Ansible best practices.

.Prerequisites
* The `execution-environment.yml` file is open in the editor.
* Copilot chat is active.

.Procedure
. Prompt the assistant to validate your {ExecEnvShort} definition file. For example:
* _Check if my `execution-environment.yaml` file is valid and follows best practices_.
+
The assistant then analyzes the file structure against the {ExecEnvShort} v3 schema and rules. It verifies required sections (for example, version, images, dependencies) and identifies missing fields or incorrect formatting.
+
. Review the assessment to confirm that it includes your requirements.
