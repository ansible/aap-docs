= Gradual adoption

For an easier gradual adoption, consider ignoring rules for an entire file.
This allows the quick introduction of a linter pipeline for preventing the addition of new violations,
while known violations are ignored.
Some people can work on addressing these historical violations while others can continue to work
on other maintenance tasks.
