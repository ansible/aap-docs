= Pre-defined EE templates

[role="_abstract"]

Pre-defined EE templates are pre-configured templates designed to accelerate environment setup for common use cases. They already include specific base images, collections, and dependencies tailored for their respective domain.

|===
| Preset | Description | Key considerations and use cases

| Start from scratch
| A template which acts as a generic blank slate to start creating custom EEs from.
| Use this preset when you require complete control over the base image and dependencies to build a highly customized or minimized EE.

| Networking Automation
| A template optimized for environments focused on network device interaction and network-specific content.
| Use this preset when your automation primarily interacts with switches, routers, firewalls, and other network infrastructure.

| Cloud Automation
| A template optimized for environments focused on deploying and managing cloud resources (such as AWS or Microsoft).
| Use this preset when your automation targets provisioning, configuration, and management of cloud services.
