[id="create-project-structure-assistant_{context}"]
= Create the project structure with the AI assistant

[role="_abstract"]
Enter a prompt in natural language to trigger the project creation tool. When prompted, `ansible-creator` works in the background to generate the directory structure.

.Procedure
. In the Copilot chat window, enter a prompt specifying the project name and type. For example:
* _Create a new Ansible playbook project called `webserver-deployment.`_
+
This triggers the `create_ansible_projects` tool. The extension then executes `ansible-creator init playbook` to generate the content.

.Verification
After the assistant confirms that the task is complete, verify that the project structure is consistent with the standard layout. 

. Navigate to the {VSCode} Explorer view.
. Locate the new directory (per the example above, `webserver-deployment/`).
. Confirm the presence of standard artifacts such as:
.. Initial playbook files.
.. Recommended configuration files (such as `ansible.cfg`, `inventory`).
