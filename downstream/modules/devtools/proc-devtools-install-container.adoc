= Installing {ToolsName} on a container inside {VSCode}

[role="_abstract"]
The Dev Containers {VSCode} extension requires a `.devcontainer` file to store settings for your dev containers. 
You must use the Ansible extension to scaffold a config file for your dev container, and reopen your directory in a container in {VSCode}.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed a containerization platform, for example Podman, Podman Desktop, Docker, or Docker Desktop.
* You have a Red Hat login and you have logged in to the Red Hat registry at `registry.redhat.io`.
For information about logging in to `registry.redhat.io`, see
link:{URLDevelopAutomationContent}/installing-devtools#devtools-setup-registry-redhat-io_installing-devtools[Authenticating with the Red Hat container registry].
* You have installed {VSCode}.
* You have installed the Ansible extension in {VSCode}.
* You have installed the link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers[Microsoft Dev Containers] extension in {VSCode}.
* If you are installing {ToolsName} on Windows, launch {VSCode} and connect to the WSL machine:
.. Click the `Remote` (image:vscode-remote-icon.png[Remote,15,15]) icon.
.. In the dropdown menu that appears, select the option to connect to the WSL machine.

.Procedure

. In {VSCode}, navigate to your project directory.
. Click the Ansible icon in the {VSCode} activity bar to open the Ansible extension.
. In the *Ansible Development Tools* section of the Ansible extension, scroll down to the *ADD* option and select *Devcontainer*. 
. In the *Create a devcontainer* page, select the *Downstream* container image from the *Container image* options.
+
This action adds `devcontainer.json` files for both Podman and Docker in a `.devcontainer` directory.
. Reopen or reload the project directory:
** If {VSCode} detects that your directory contains a `devcontainer.json` file, the following notification appears:
+
image::devtools-reopen-in-container.png[Reopen in container]
+
Click *Reopen in Container*.
** If the notification does not appear, click the `Remote` (image:vscode-remote-icon.png[Remote,15,15]) icon. In the dropdown menu that appears, select *Reopen in Container*.
. Select the dev container for Podman or Docker according to the containerization platform you are using.
+
The *Remote ()* status in the {VSCode} Status bar displays `opening Remote` and a notification indicates the progress in opening the container.

.Verification
When the directory reopens in a container, the *Remote ()* status displays `Dev Container: ansible-dev-container`.


[NOTE]
====
The base image for the container is a Universal Base Image Minimal (UBI Minimal) image that uses `microdnf` as a package manager.
The `dnf` and `yum` package managers are not available in the container.

For information about using `microdnf` in containers based on UBI Minimal images, see
