. In the OpenShift Developer UI, navigate to menu:Helm[developer-hub > Actions > Upgrade > Yaml view].
. Locate the `global` section.

global:
  # Ensure OCI mode is enabled
  pluginMode: oci
  
  # UPDATE this value to the new desired version
  imageTagInfo: "2.1" 

  # Note: Do not manually update 'plugins' packages; 
  # OCI mode handles the download automatically based on the tag above.
  dynamic:
    plugins: []

The {RHDH} pods restart and pull the new plug-in versions.
