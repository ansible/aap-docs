= Configuring Ansible extension settings

[role="_abstract"]

The Ansible extension supports multiple configuration options.

You can configure the settings for the extension on a user level, on a workspace level, or for a particular directory.
User-based settings are applied globally for any instance of VS Code that is opened.
Workspace settings are stored within your workspace and only apply when the current workspace is opened.

It is useful to configure settings for your workspace for the following reasons:

* If you define and maintain configurations specific to your playbook project,
you can customize your Ansible development environment for individual projects without altering your preferred setup for other work.
You can have different settings for a Python project, an Ansible project, and a C++ project, each optimized for the respective stack without the need to manually reconfigure settings each time you switch projects.
* If you include workspace settings when setting up version control for a project you want to share with your team, everyone uses the same configuration for that project.
