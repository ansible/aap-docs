= Associating the Ansible language to YAML files

[role="_abstract"]

The Ansible {VSCode} extension works only when the language associated with a file is set to Ansible.
The extension provides features that help create Ansible playbooks, such as auto-completion, hover, and diagnostics.

The Ansible {VSCode} extension automatically associates the Ansible language with some files.
The procedures below describe how to set the language for files that are not recognized as Ansible files.

.Manually associating the Ansible language to YAML files

The following procedure describes how to manually assign the Ansible language to a YAML file that is open in {VSCode}.

. Open or create a YAML file in {VSCode}.
. Hover the cursor over the language identified in the status bar at the bottom of the {VSCode} window to open the *Select Language Mode* list.
. Select *Ansible* in the list.
+
The language shown in the status bar at the bottom of the {VSCode} window for the file is changed to Ansible.

.Adding persistent file association for the Ansible language to `settings.json`

Alternatively, you can add file association for the Ansible language in your `settings.json` file.

. Open the `settings.json` file:
.. Click menu:View[Command Palette] to open the command palette.
.. Enter `Workspace settings` in the search box and select *Open Workspace Settings (JSON)*.
