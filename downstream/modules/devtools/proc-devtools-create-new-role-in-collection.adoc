= Creating a new role in your collection

[role="_abstract"]
Create a new Ansible role within your collection by copying the default role directory.

.Procedure

. To create a new role, copy the default `run` role directory that was scaffolded when you created the collection.
. Define the tasks that you want your role to perform in the `tasks/main.yml` file.
If you are creating a role to reuse tasks in an existing playbook,
copy the content in the tasks block of your playbook YAML file.
Remove the whitespace to the left of the tasks.
Use `ansible-lint` in {VSCode} to check your YAML code.
. If your role depends on another role, add the dependency in the `meta/main.yml` file.
