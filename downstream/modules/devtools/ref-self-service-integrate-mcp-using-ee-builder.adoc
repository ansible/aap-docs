= Integrating Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers through the EE Builder

[role="_abstract"]

The EE Builder supports the optional integration of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. MCP servers are an advanced feature used to expose automation actions to AI assistants or other cognitive services.

If you select an MCP server, the EE Builder automatically handles the necessary configuration files and dependencies.  This portal feature generates execution environment definition files for building an execution environment with your selected MCP servers.

The EE Builder currently supports the following MCP servers:

* Git Hub
* AWS
** AWS CCAPI
** AWS CDK
** AWS IAM
** AWS Core
* Azure
