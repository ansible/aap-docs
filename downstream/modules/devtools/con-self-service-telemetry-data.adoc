= Telemetry data collected by Red Hat

[role="_abstract"]
Red Hat collects and analyses the following data:

* Events of page visits and clicks on links or buttons.
* System-related information, for example, locale, timezone, user agent including browser and OS details.
* Page-related information, for example, title, category, extension name, URL, path, referrer, and search parameters.
* Anonymized IP addresses, recorded as `0.0.0.0`.
* Anonymized username hashes, which are unique identifiers used solely to identify the number of unique users of the RHDH application.
* Feedback and sentiment submitted through the {SelfServiceshort} feedback form, including a 1-5 star rating and feedback text. Users must acknowledge that they share the feedback with Red Hat before submitting.
