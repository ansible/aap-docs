[id="install-mcp-devtools_{context}"]
= Install {ToolsName} with the AI assistant

If you do not have {ToolsName} installed, you can instruct the AI assistant to install them.

.Procedure
. Open GitHub Copilot Chat.
. Enter the prompt: _Make sure I have `ansible-dev-tools` installed_. 
+
The system then checks if ADT is installed. If so, the assistant will report that `ansible-dev-tools` is installed. If ADT is not installed, the AI assistant chooses a package manager (`pip` or `pipx`) and installs ADT automatically. 

.Verification
When installation is complete, the AI agent will return a message in the Copilot chat window confirming that ADT has been installed successfully. You can also prompt the AI agent to _check my Ansible environment_ again. If the installation was successful, the AI assistant will verify that ADT is installed in your environment.
