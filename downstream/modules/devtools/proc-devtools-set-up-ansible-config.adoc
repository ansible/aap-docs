= Setting up the Ansible configuration file for your playbook project

[role="_abstract"]
When you scaffolded your playbook project, an Ansible configuration file, `ansible.cfg`,
was added to the root directory of your project.

If you have configured a default Ansible configuration file in `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`,
copy any settings that you want to reuse in your project from your default Ansible configuration file
to the `ansible.cfg` file in your project's root directory.

To learn more about the Ansible configuration file, see
link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html[Ansible Configuration Settings]
in the Ansible documentation.
