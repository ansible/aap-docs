[id="run-playbook-with-assistant_{context}"]
= Run a playbook with ansible-navigator

[role="_abstract"]
Prompt the AI assistant for help with running playbooks.


.Procedure
. Prompt the assistant to generate a command that runs the playbook in your execution environment. For example:
. Include one imperative sentence for each step, for example:
* _Give me the command to run this playbook in the execution environment <file name>_.
+
The assistant then generates an appropriate `ansible-navigator` command, ensuring the `--execution-environment-image` flag points to your newly-built tag.
+
A generated command might look like the following:
+
[source,python]
----
ansible-navigator run playbook.yml --execution-environment-image webserver-ee:1.0 --mode stdout
----
+
. Execute the command in the {VSCode} terminal to run your automation within the custom environment.
