= Caching

For optimal performance, Ansible-lint creates caches with installed or
mocked roles, collections, and modules in the `{project_dir}/.cache`
folder. The location of `{project_dir}` is passed with a command line
argument, determined by the location of the configuration file, git
project top-level directory, or user home directory.

To perform faster re-runs, Ansible-lint does not automatically clean the
cache. If required you can do this manually by simply deleting the
`.cache` folder. Ansible-lint creates a new cache on the next
invocation.

Add the `.cache` folder to the `.gitignore` file in your
git repositories.
