= Updating the {SelfServiceShort} version numbers for a Helm installation

[role="_abstract"]
After you have updated your plug-in registry for your {SelfServiceShort} project on your {OCPShort} instance,
you must update the Helm chart with the new versions of your plug-ins files.

You can update the Helm chart from the command line using `helm` commands, or from the OpenShift web console.

[NOTE]
====
For upgrades in air-gapped or disconnected environments, the standard procedure cannot be used directly.
You must first mirror the necessary container images to your local registry and prepare the Helm chart for offline use.

For detailed instructions on this process, see the 
link:{URLSelfServiceInstall}/self-service-disconnected-install_aap-self-service-install[Installing the self-service automation portal in an air-gapped environment] section of _{LinkSelfServiceInstall}_.

* *Update the Helm chart from the command line:*

$ helm upgrade <release_name> openshift-helm-charts/redhat-rhaap-portal --version <chart_version>

Replace `<release_name>` with the name of your Helm release and `<chart_version>`
with the new Helm chart version number you identified in the previous step.
