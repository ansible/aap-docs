= Installing the {VSCode} Ansible extension

[role="_abstract"]

The Ansible extension adds language support for Ansible to {VSCode}.
It incorporates {ToolsName} to facilitate creating and running automation content.

For a full description of the Ansible extension, see the link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.ansible[Visual Studio Code Marketplace].

See link:https://red.ht/aap-lp-vscode-essentials[Learning path - Getting Started with the Ansible {VSCode} Extension] for tutorials on working with the extension.

To install the Ansible {VSCode} extension: 

. Open {VSCode}.
. Click the *Extensions* (image:vscode-extensions-icon.png[Extensions,15,15]) icon in the Activity Bar, or click menu:View[Extensions], to display the *Extensions* view.
. In the search field in the *Extensions* view, type `Ansible Red Hat`. 
. Select the Ansible extension and click btn:[Install].

When the language for a file is recognized as Ansible, the Ansible extension provides features such as auto-completion, hover, diagnostics, and goto.
The language identified for a file is displayed in the Status bar at the bottom of the {VSCode} window.

The following files are assigned the Ansible language:

* YAML files in a `/playbooks` directory 
* Files with the following double extension: `.ansible.yml` or `.ansible.yaml`
* Certain YAML names recognized by Ansible, for example `site.yml` or `site.yaml`
* YAML files whose filename contains "playbook": `*playbook*.yml` or `*playbook*.yaml`

If the extension does not identify the language for your playbook files as Ansible, follow the procedure in 
xref:devtools-extension-set-language_installing-devtools[Associating the Ansible language to YAML files].
