Depending on your existing setup, you can integrate these products from {PlatformNameShort} or from {Terraform}. Migration paths are provided for community users and for migrating from the `cloud.terraform` collection to `hashicorp.terraform`.

== Ansible-initiated workflow

Ansible automation hub collections allow {PlatformNameShort} users to leverage the {TerraformEnterpriseShortName} or {TerraformCloudShortName} provisioning capabilities.

**hashicorp.terraform collection**

This collection provides API integration between {PlatformNameShort} and {TerraformEnterpriseShortName} or {TerraformCloudShortName}. This solution works natively with {PlatformNameShort} and reduces setup complexity because it doesnâ€™t require a binary installation and it includes a default execution environment.

**cloud.terraform collection**

This collection provides CLI integration between {PlatformNameShort} and {TerraformEnterpriseShortName} or {TerraformCloudShortName}. To use this collection, you must install a binary and create an execution environment.

Although this collection is supported, we recommend using the `hashicorp.terraform` collection instead to take advantage of its API capabilities.

== Migration workflows 

Community edition users can migrate to {TerraformEnterpriseShortName} or {TerraformCloudShortName}, and then integrate the {PlatformNameShort} capabilities using the `cloud.terraform` (CLI) collection. However, we recommend using the `hashicorp.terraform` (API) collection instead.

If you are already using the `cloud.terraform` collection, you can migrate to `hashicorp.terraform`.

== {Terraform}-initiated workflow

For existing {TerraformEnterpriseShortName} or {TerraformCloudShortName} users, {Terraform} can directly call {PlatformNameShort} at the end of provisioning for a more seamless and secure workflow. This enables {TerraformEnterpriseShortName} or {TerraformCloudShortName} users to enhance their immutable infrastructure automation with {PlatformNameShort} Day 2 automation capabilities and manage infrastructure updates and lifecycle events.
