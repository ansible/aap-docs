Depending on your existing setup, you can integrate these products from {PlatformNameShort} or from {Terraform}. Migration paths are provided for community users and for migrating from the `cloud.terraform` collection to `hashicorp.teraform`.

== Ansible-initiated workflow

Ansible automation hub collections allow {PlatformNameShort} users to leverage {Terraform}'s provisioning capabilities.

**hashi.terraform collection**

This collection provides API integration between {PlatformNameShort} and {Terraform}. This solution works natively with {PlatformNameShort} and reduces setup complexity because it doesnâ€™t require a binary installation and includes a default execution environment.

If you are already using the `cloud.terraform` collection, we recommend migrating to the `hashicorp.terraform` collection to take advantage of the API capabilities.


**cloud.terraform collection**

This collection provides CLI integration between {PlatformNameShort} and {Terraform}. To use this collection, you must install a binary and create an execution environment.

Although this collection is supported, and you can migrate from the Community-edition {Terraform} to `cloud.terraform`, we recommend using the `hashicorp.terraform` collection instead to take advantage of its API capabilities.

**hashicorp.vault collection**

For new {Vault} users, the `hashicorp.vault` collection is included in the supported execution environment from automation hub.

For existing `community.hashi_vault` users, the `hashicorp.vault` solution is intended to replace the unsupported `community.hashi_vault` collection. You can [use the migration path] to keep your existing playbooks.

== {Terraform}-initiated workflow

For existing {Terraform} users, {Terraform} can directly call {PlatformNameShort} at the end of provisioning for a more seamless and secure workflow. This enables {Terraform} users to enhance their immutable infrastructure automation with {PlatformNameShort} Day 2 automation capabilities and manage infrastructure updates and lifecycle events.
