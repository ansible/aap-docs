Many organizations find themselves using both {PlatformNameShort} and {TerraformEnterpriseShortName} or {TerraformCloudShortName}, recognizing that these can work in harmony to create an improved experience for developers and operations teams. While {TerraformEnterpriseShortName} and {TerraformCloudShortName} excel at Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for provisioning and de-provisioning cloud resources, {PlatformNameShort} is a versatile, all-purpose automation solution ideal for configuration management, application deployment, and orchestrating complex IT workflows across diverse domains.

This integration directly addresses common challenges such as managing disparate automation tools, ensuring consistent configuration across hybrid cloud environments and accelerating deployment cycles. By bringing together {Terraform}'s declarative approach to infrastructure provisioning with {PlatformNameShort}'s procedural approach to configuration and orchestration, users can achieve:

* **Optimized costs:** Reduce cloud waste, minimize manual processes, and combat tool sprawl. This integration can lead to a significant reduction in infrastructure costs and a high return on investment.

* **Reduced risk:** Lower the risk of breaches, enforce policies, and significantly decrease unplanned downtime. The ability to review {Terraform} plan output before applying it in a workflow, with approval steps, enhances security and compliance.

* **Faster time to value:** Boost developer productivity and deploy new compute resources more rapidly, leading to a faster time to market. This is achieved through unified lifecycle management and automation for Day 0 (provisioning), Day 1 (configuration), and Day 2 (ongoing management) operations.

By enabling direct calls between {PlatformNameShort} and {TerraformEnterpriseShortName} or {TerraformCloudShortName}, organizations can unlock time to value by creating combined workflows, reduce risk through enhanced product integrations, and enhance Infrastructure-as-Code with {PlatformNameShort} content and practices. This allows for unified lifecycle management, enabling tasks from initial provisioning and configuration to ongoing health checks, incident response, patching, and infrastructure optimization.
