= Migrating from the community edition

When you migrate from TCE to TFE or {TerraformCloudShortName}, you are not migrating the collection itself. Instead, you are adapting your existing TCE usage to work with TFE or {TerraformCloudShortName}. After you migrate, you must update the {PlatformNameShort} credentials, execution environment, and job templates.

[NOTE]
====
The `cloud.terraform` collection only supports the CLI-driven workflow in {TerraformCloudShortName}.
====

.Prerequisites

* Use the latest supported version of {Terraform} (1.11 or higher).
* Follow the `tf-migrate` CLI instructions under **Additional resources** below.
* Ensure that the {TerraformCloudShortName} or TFE workspace is not set to automatically apply plans.

.Procedure

. To prevent errors when running playbooks against TFE or {TerraformCloudShortName}, do the following actions before running a playbook:

.. Confirm that the {Terraform} version in the {ExecEnvShort} is the same as the version stated in TFE or {TerraformCloudShortName}.
.. Perform an initialization in TFE or {TerraformCloudShortName}:
+
----
terraform init
----
+
.. If you have a local state file in your {ExecEnvShort}, delete the local state file.
.. Get a token from {TerraformCloudShortName} or {TerraformEnterpriseShortName}, which you will use to create the credential in a later step. Ensure the token has the necessary permissions based on the team or user token to execute the desired capabilities in the playbook.
.. Remove the backend config and files from your playbook definition.
.. Add the workspace within the default setting in your TF config or an environment variable if you want to define the workspace outside updating the playbook itself.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can add the workspace to your playbook to scale your workspace utilization.

. (Optional) After the migration is completed and verified, you can run the additional modules and plugins from the collection in your {ExecEnvShort}:
