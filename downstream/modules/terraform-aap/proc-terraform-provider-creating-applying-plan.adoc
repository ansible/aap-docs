= Creating and applying the plan

[role="_abstract"]

After you configure your {Terraform} plan to include {EDAName} events, you create and apply the plan to trigger the events.

.Procedure

. Run `terraform init` to initialize your working directory.
. Use `terraform plan` to commit to create the plan. The following example also saves the plan to a file named `tfplan.out`, but you can specify any name for the plan. Saving the plan is a best practice for automation because the saved plan is strictly enforced.
+
----
terraform plan -out=tfplan.out
----

. Review the plan output.
. Apply the saved plan.
+
----
terraform apply tfplan.out
----
+
This creates and sends an event to the specified event stream. As each resource is created, TF actions are invoked and the corresponding {PlatformNameShort} playbooks are executed sequentially.


.Verification

. Verify that the runs are updated in the {Terraform} user interface. Drill down on a resource to see that the action was invoked and a post event was executed.
. From the {PlatformNameShort} user interface, verify that the event is successfully received by (EDAName} and triggers the appropriate rulebook activation:
.. Check the **Event Streams** dashboard to see the TF Actions events were received.
.. Check the **Jobs** dashboard to see the jobs running sequentially and with a **Success** status.
.. Check the **Inventory** dashboard to see the updates. For example, if you created new servers, check the **Hosts** tab for the {Terraform} provisioned inventory.
