= Creating a custom credential type

[role="_abstract"]

Administrators set up a custom credential type to facilitate authentication between {PlatformNameShort} and {Terraform}. This preparation helps ensure that credentials are provided automatically to the execution environment, eliminating the need to update playbooks manually.

Additionally, you can configure a custom credential for {Vault} to leverage the advanced features of both {Terraform} and {Vault} with {PlatformNameShort}.

.Prerequisites
* You must have a link:https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens#user-api-tokens[{Terraform} API token].
* Install the certified `hashicorp.terraform` collection from automation hub. (You need an Ansible subscription to access and download collections on automation hub.)

.Procedure

. Log in to {PlatformNameShort}.
. From the navigation panel, select **{MenuAECredentialType}**.
. Click btn:[Create a credential type]. The **Create Credential Type** page opens and displays the **Details** tab.
. For the **Credential Type**, enter a name.
