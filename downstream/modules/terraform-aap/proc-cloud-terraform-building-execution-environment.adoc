= Building an {ExecEnvShort} in {PlatformNameShort}

You must build an {ExecEnvShort} using the automation controller so that {PlatformNameShort} can provide the credentials necessary for using its automation features.

.Prerequisites

* You need a pre-existing {ExecEnvShort} with the latest version of `cloud.terraform` collection before you can create it using an automation controller. You cannot use the default {ExecEnvShort} provided by {PlatformNameShort} because the default environment does not include the `terraform` CLI binary.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you have migrated from {TerraformCommunityName}, you can continue to use your existing {ExecEnvShort} and update it to the latest version of `cloud.terraform`.
====
+
* Install the `terraform` CLI binary in your pre-existing {ExecEnvShort}. See **Additional resources** below for a link to the binary.

.Procedure

. From the navigation panel, select **{MenuInfrastructureExecEnvironments}**.
. Click btn:[Create {ExecEnvShort}].

. Click btn:[Create {ExecEnvShort}]. Your newly added {ExecEnvShort} is ready to be used in a job template.
