[id="terraform-building-execution-environment"]

= Building an execution environment in {PlatformNameShort}

You must build an execution environment using the automation controller so that {PlatformNameShort} can provide the credentials necessary for using its automation features.

.Prerequisites

* You need a pre-existing execution environment with the latest version of `cloud.terraform`` collection before you can create it using an automation controller. You cannot use the default execution environment provided by {PlatformNameShort} because the default environment does not include the terraform CLI binary.

   [NOTE]
   ====
   If you have migrated from Terraform Community, you can continue to use your existing execution environment and update it to the latest version of cloud.terraform.
   ====

* Install the `terraform`` CLI binary in your pre-existing execution environment. See **Additional resources** below for a link to the binary.

.Procedure

. From the navigation panel, select **Infrastructure > Execution Environments**.
. Click btn:[Create execution environment].

. For **Image**, enter the repository link to the image for your pre-existing execution environment.
. Click btn:[Create execution environment].
   Your newly added execution environment is ready to be used in a job template.
