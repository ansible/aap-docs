|Metric
|Description

|**Cost of manual automation**
|The estimated cost of manually performing all automated tasks. This estimated value is based on the time taken to manually run each job, multiplied by a labor cost rate.

|**Cost of automated execution**
|The actual cost incurred for automation execution using {PlatformNameShort}. This includes the resources consumed by {PlatformNameShort}, such as server time and processing power.

|**Total savings/cost avoided**
|The difference between the **Cost of manual automation** and the **Cost of automated execution**. This is a key metric for demonstrating the return on investment.

|**Total hours saved/avoided**
|The figure calculated by adding host executions and automation creation time, then subtracting the running time in minutes.

|**Time taken to manually execute (min)**
|The amount of time it would take for a user to perform the task manually on a host. This input compares the value of manual execution and automated execution.
