The variable is needed when the bundled installer is being built.
[NOTE]
End users can omit this variable.

|`registry_username`
|Username used to pull container images from `registry.redhat.io`.

|`dashboard_pg_host`
`dashboard_pg_username`
`dashboard_pg_password`

|`bundle_dir`
|This is the directory where the installation bundle was unpacked `+ /bundle` (for example: `/home/<username>/ansible-automation-dashboard-containerized-setup/bundle`). The default value is relative to the current directory (PWD) and should work out of the box.
