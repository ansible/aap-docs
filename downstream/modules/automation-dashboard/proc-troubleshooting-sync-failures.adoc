= Troubleshooting synchronization failures

[role="_abstract"]
If new jobs from {PlatformNameShort} do not synchronize to the {AutomationDashboardName} after an upgrade, an interrupted synchronization job might be blocking the process.
This occurs if the upgrade process interrupts an active synchronization task.

To resolve this issue, you must manually remove the stuck jobs from the database.

.Prerequisites

* You have root or sudo access to the host machine.
* You have the PostgreSQL admin password defined in your inventory file (variable `postgresql_admin_password`).

.Procedure

. Connect to the {AutomationDashboardName} database. You must replace `<password>` with your configured `postgresql_admin_password`.
+
[source,bash]
----
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<password> psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U postgres -d aapdashboard
----

. Identify jobs that are in a pending or running state:
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM scheduler_syncjob WHERE status IN ('pending','waiting','running');
----

. Wait approximately one minute and run the command again. If the same job IDs appear in the output, these jobs are stuck.

. Delete the stuck jobs using their ID. Replace `<id>` with the ID returned in the previous step (for example, `20, 21`):
+
[source,sql]
----
DELETE from scheduler_syncjob WHERE id IN (<id>);
----

.Verification

* Refresh the {AutomationDashboardName} to confirm that synchronization has resumed.
