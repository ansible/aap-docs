= Filter and save automation data for reporting

{AutomationDashboardName} provides filtering options to analyze your {PlatformNameShort} automation runs. You can select one or more filtering options to customize your report, select a time period and a currency, and save your report to your {AutomationDashboardName}.

== Filters

Select one or more of the following filtering options to customize your report:

* **Template:** allows you to select one or more Job Templates
* **Organization:** allows you to select one or more Organizations
* **Project:** allows you to select one or more Projects
* **Label:** allows you to select one or more automations by label. Labels must be preconfigured and assigned to {PlatformNameShort} in order to be displayed in {AutomationDashboardName}. For more information on configuring labels, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/using_automation_execution/controller-job-templates#controller-create-job-template[Creating a job template].

== Time period and currency

After selecting your filters, select a time period for analysis, and select a currency to demonstrate automation savings.

* A shorter time period is useful when considering specific automation use cases.
* A longer time period is useful when considering overall platform usage and automation growth.
* Changing from one currency to another does not convert the value of that currency. You must manually change the manual and automation cost figures to reflect whichever currency you select. 

== Saving a report

Use *Save as Report* to save this report to your {AutomationDashboardName}. You can retrieve it at any time by using *Select a Report*.
