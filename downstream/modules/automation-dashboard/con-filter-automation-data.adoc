[role="_abstract"]
{AutomationDashboardName} provides filtering options to analyze your {PlatformNameShort} automation runs.
You can select one or more filtering options to customize your report, select a time period and a currency, and save your report to your {AutomationDashboardName}.

* **Template:** select one or more Job Templates
* **Organization:** select one or more Organizations
* **Project:** select one or more Projects
* **Label:** select one or more automation projects by label.

[NOTE]
====
You must preconfigure and assign labels to {PlatformNameShort} for display in {AutomationDashboardName}.
For more information on configuring labels, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/using_automation_execution/controller-job-templates#controller-create-job-template[Creating a job template].

== Time period and currency

After selecting your filters, select a time period for analysis, and select a currency to show automation savings.

* A shorter time period is useful when considering specific automation use cases.
* A longer time period is useful when considering overall platform usage and automation growth.
* Changing from one currency to another does not convert the value of that currency. You must manually change the manual and automation cost figures to reflect whichever currency you select. 

== Saving a report

Use *Save as Report* to save this report to your {AutomationDashboardName}. You can retrieve it at any time by using *Select a Report*.
