{ControllerNameStart} integrates with VMware vSphere to manage virtual machines (VMs) as part of its infrastructure. This integration allows users to automate the provisioning, management, and decommissioning of VMs within a VMware environment.

VMware cloud credentials are exposed as the following environment variables during playbook execution (in the job template, choose the cloud credential needed for your setup):

* `VMWARE_USER`
* `VMWARE_PASSWORD`
* `VMWARE_HOST`

The following sample playbook demonstrates the usage of these credentials:

----
- vsphere_guest:
    vcenter_hostname: "{{ lookup('env', 'VMWARE_HOST') }}"
    username: "{{ lookup('env', 'VMWARE_USER') }}"
    password: "{{ lookup('env', 'VMWARE_PASSWORD') }}"
    guest: newvm001
    from_template: yes
    template_src: linuxTemplate
    cluster: MainCluster
    resource_pool: "/Resources"
    vm_extra_config:
      folder: MyFolder
