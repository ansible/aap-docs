When you build an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) disk image from an operating system image by using the `bootc-image-builder` tool, the image is similar to the RHEL ISOs available for download. 
However, your operating system image content is embedded in the ISO disk image.

To install the ISO disk image to a bare metal system without having access to the network, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/using_image_mode_for_rhel_to_build_deploy_and_manage_operating_systems/deploying-the-rhel-bootc-images_using-image-mode-for-rhel-to-build-deploy-and-manage-operating-systems#deploying-an-custom-iso-container-image_deploying-the-rhel-bootc-images[Deploying a custom ISO container image] in the {RHEL} documentation.

To install the ISO disk image through the network, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/using_image_mode_for_rhel_to_build_deploy_and_manage_operating_systems/deploying-the-rhel-bootc-images_using-image-mode-for-rhel-to-build-deploy-and-manage-operating-systems#deploying-an-iso-bootc-container-over-pxe-boot_deploying-the-rhel-bootc-images[Deploying an ISO _bootc_ image over PXE boot] in the {RHEL} documentation.
