= Continuous integration / Continuous Deployment

For a Continuous Integration system, such as Jenkins, to spawn a job, it must make a `curl` request to a job template. 
The credentials to the job template must not require prompting for any particular passwords.
For configuration and use instructions, see link:https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/controllercli/usage.html[Installation] in the Ansible documentation.
