= User creation with many authenticators in {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers}

In {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers}, user account management is unique to each configured authenticator. 
When a user authenticates through many external sources, such as LDAP and SAML, the platform creates a separate user record for each authenticator.

This behavior results in the following:

* Distinct records: Each external authenticator creates its own user record.
* Unique names: The system requires a unique username for every user entry.
* Username collision: If a user's login causes a username collision (the name already exists from a different authenticator), the system appends a hash or other identifying characters to the subsequent user account's username to maintain uniqueness.
