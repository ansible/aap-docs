= Deleting Hosts automated using API endpoint

The API lists only non-deleted records and are sortable by last_automation and used_in_inventories columns.

You can use the host metric API endpoint, `api/v2/host_metric` to soft delete hosts, using:

`api/v2/host_metric <n> DELETE`

A monthly scheduled task automatically deletes jobs that uses hosts from the Host Metric table that were last automated more than a year ago.
