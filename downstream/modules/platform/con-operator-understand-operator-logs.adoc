= Understanding {ControllerName} operator logs

When the operator deploys an *Automation Controller* instance, it runs an installer role inside the operator container. If the {ControllerName}'s status is `Failed`, you must check the `automation-controller-operator` container logs. These logs provide the installer role's output and are a critical first step in debugging deployment issues.
