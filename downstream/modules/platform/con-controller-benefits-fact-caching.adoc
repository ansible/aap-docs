= Benefits of fact caching

[role="_abstract"]
Fact caching saves you time over running fact gathering. 
If you have a playbook in a job that runs against a thousand hosts and forks, it can take 10 minutes to gather facts across all of those hosts.

If you run a job on a regular basis, the first run of it caches these facts and the next run pulls them from the database. 
This reduces the runtime of jobs against large inventories.

[NOTE]
====
Do not change the ansible.cfg file to apply fact caching. 
Custom fact caching could conflict with the controller's fact caching feature.
You must use the fact caching module that includes {ControllerName}.
====

You can select to use cached facts in your job by checking the *Enable fact storage* option when you create or edit a job template.

To clear facts, run the Ansible `clear_facts` link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/meta_module.html#examples[meta task].
The following is an example playbook that uses the Ansible `clear_facts` meta task.

----
- hosts: all
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Clear gathered facts from all currently targeted hosts
      meta: clear_facts
----

You can find the API endpoint for fact caching at:

\http://<controller server name>/api/v2/hosts/x/ansible_facts
