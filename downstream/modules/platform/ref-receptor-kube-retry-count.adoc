[id="receptor-kube-retry-count"]

= Receptor Kubernetes retry count variable

[role="_abstract"]
Configure the Receptor worker within the {OperatorPlatformNameShort} through the `RECEPTOR_KUBE_RETRY_COUNT` environment variable. 
This variable controls how the worker handles Kubernetes API connection failures.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The retry mechanism uses an exponential backoff strategy which is capped at 5 minutes to prevent excessive wait times during job execution errors.

| `RECEPTOR_KUBE_RETRY_COUNT`
| Sets the maximum number of retry attempts for Kubernetes API operations within the Receptor worker. Retry delays increase using exponential backoff with a Fibonacci-like sequence.
| `5`
| `1` - `100`

*Configuration recommendations*

If a playbook is expected to run for more than 20 hours, or if it remains without output for more than 2 to 4 hours, increase `RECEPTOR_KUBE_RETRY_COUNT` from the default value.
For a 20-hour job, a retry count of 10 is recommended. 
This setting allows approximately 2 hours for each retry attempt, ensuring the worker does not time out prematurely during long-running operations.
