= Searching using values from related fields

Searching a Related Field requires you to start the search string with the Related Field. 
The following example describes how to search using values from the Related Field, _organization_.

The left-hand side of the search string must start with `organization`, for example, `organization:Default`. 
Depending on the related field, you can provide more specific direction for the search by providing secondary and tertiary fields. 
An example of this is to specify that you want to search for all job templates that use a project matching a certain name. 
The syntax on this would look like: `job_template.project.name:"A Project"`.

[NOTE]
====
This query executes against the `unified_job_templates` endpoint which is why it starts with `job_template`. 
If you were searching against the `job_templates` endpoint, then you would not need the `job_template` portion of the query.
