= Automation controller and automation hub 2.4 and Event-Driven Ansible 2.5 with unified UI upgrades

{PlatformNameShort} 2.5 supports upgrades from {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 environments for all components, with the exception of {EDAName}. You can also configure a mixed environment with {EDAName} from 2.5 connected to a legacy 2.4 cluster. Combining install methods (OCP, RPM, Containerized) within such a topology is not supported by {PlatformNameShort}.

[NOTE]
====
If you are running the 2.4 version of {EDAName} in production, before you upgrade, contact Red Hat support or your account representative for more information on how to move to {PlatformNameShort} 2.5.
====

Supported topologies described in this document assume that:

* 2.4 services will only include {ControllerName} and {HubName}.
* 2.5 parts will always include {EDAName} and the unified UI ({Gateway}).
* Combining installation methods for these topologies is not supported.

== Upgrade considerations

* You must maintain two separate inventory files: one for the 2.4 services and one for the 2.5 services.
* You must maintain two separate installations within this scenario: one for the 2.4 services and one for the 2.5 services. 
* You must upgrade the two separate installations separately.
* To upgrade to a consistent component version topology, consider the following: 
** You must manually combine the inventory file configuration from the 2.4 inventory into the 2.5 inventory and run upgrade on ONLY the 2.5 inventory file. 
** You must be using an external database for both the 2.4 inventory as well as the 2.5 inventory. 
** Customers using managed database instances for either 2.4 or 2.5 inventory must migrate to an external database first, before upgrading.
