= Configuring log verbosity

You can enable task output for debugging on any custom resources (CRs) by setting `no_log` to `false` in the `spec` section of the CR.
The logs then show output for any failed tasks that originally had `no_log` set to `true`.
The following procedure uses {ControllerName} as an example, but every CR listed in the link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html-single/installing_on_openshift_container_platform/index#ref-operator-core-aap-resources_operator-troubleshoot[Core {PlatformNameShort} Resources] section supports `no_log`. 

.Procedure

. Edit the {ControllerName} CR and set the `no_log` field to `false` in the spec.

[NOTE]
====
This might expose sensitive data in the logs. On production clusters, this value must generally be set to `true` unless you are actively debugging an issue.

. To increase the Ansible Playbook verbosity from the operator, set the verbosity level using an annotation:
