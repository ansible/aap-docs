|Description
|Required or optional
|Default

|N/A
|`mcp_allow_write_operations`
|Determines whether the Ansible MCP server allows actions that modify state, such as launching jobs or updating templates through the external AI tool.

By default, the variable's value is set to `false`, so that the Ansible MCP server enables read-only operations and blocks all write operations. To enable the Ansible MCP server to perform write operations, change the value of the variable to `true`.
|Optional
|`false`

|N/A
|`mcp_ignore_certificate_errors`
|Specifies whether to skip validation of SSL/TLS certificates when connecting to an MCP server over a secure transport (HTTPS/WSS). 

Set this parameter value to `true` to allow connections to servers with self-signed, expired, or otherwise untrusted certificates, primarily during local development or internal testing.
|Optional
|`false`

|N/A
|`mcp_tls_cert`
|Path to the SSL/TLS certificate file for the Ansible MCP server.

|Required if using client certificate authentication.
|

|N/A
|`mcp_tls_key`
|Path to the SSL/TLS key file for the Ansible MCP server.

|Required if using client certificate authentication.
