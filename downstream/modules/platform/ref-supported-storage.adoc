[id="ref-supported-storage"]

= Supported storage

Supported storage is available for storing the raw data obtained by using the `metrics-utility gather_automation_controller_billing_data` command and storing the generated reports obtained by using the `metrics-utility build_report` command. 
Apply the environment variables to this storage based on your {PlatformNameShort} installation.

== Local disk
For an installation of {PlatformNameShort} on {RHEL}, the default storage option is a local disk. Using an OpenShift deployment of {OCPShort}, default storage is a path inside the attached Persistent Volume Claim.

----
# Set needed ENV VARs for gathering data and generating reports
export METRICS_UTILITY_SHIP_TARGET=directory
# Your path on the local disk
export METRICS_UTILITY_SHIP_PATH=/path_to_data_and_reports/...

== Object storage with S3 interface

To use object storage with S3 interface, for example, with AWS S3, Ceph Object storage, or Minio, you must define environment variables for data gathering and report building commands and cronjobs.
