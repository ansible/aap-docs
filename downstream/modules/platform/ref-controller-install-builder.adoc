= Install ansible-builder

[role="_abstract"]
To create custom {ExecEnvShort}s, you need to install the `ansible-builder` tool.

To build images, you must have Podman or Docker installed, along with the `ansible-builder` Python package. 

The `--container-runtime` option must correspond to the Podman or Docker executable you intend to use.

When building an {ExecEnvShort} image, it must support the architecture that {PlatformNameShort} is deployed with.

For more information, see link:https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/builder/en/latest/#quickstart-for-ansible-builder[Quickstart for Ansible Builder], or link:{URLBuilder}/index[Creating and consuming execution environments].
