= Adding devices to a fleet on the CLI

[role="_abstract"]

Use the {RedHatEdge} CLI to define the label selectors for a fleet resource, automatically enrolling devices that match the specified criteria. 
This streamlines fleet management by enabling consistent configuration and policy enforcement across a defined group of devices.

.Procedure 

. Run the following command to verify that the label selector returns the devices that you want to add to the fleet:

+
[source,bash]
----
flightctl get devices -l type=pos-terminal -l stage=development
----

. If running the command returns the expected list of devices, you can define a fleet that selects the devices by using the following YAML file:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: flightctl.io/v1alpha1
kind: Fleet
metadata:
  name: my_fleet
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      type: pos-terminal
      stage: development
[...]
----

. Apply the change by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
flightctl apply -f my_fleet.yaml
----

. Check for any overlaps with the selector of other fleets by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
flightctl get fleets/my_fleet -o json | jq -r '.status.conditions[] | select(.type=="OverlappingSelectors").status'
----

+
See the following example output:

+
[source,bash]
----
False
----
