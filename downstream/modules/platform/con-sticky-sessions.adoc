= Enable sticky sessions for automation hub

[role="_abstract"]
By default, an application load balancer routes each request independently to a registered target based on the chosen load balancing algorithm. 

To avoid authentication errors when running multiple instances of {HubName} behind a load balancer, you must enable sticky sessions. 
Enabling sticky sessions sets a custom application cookie that matches the cookie configured on the load balancer to enable stickiness. 
This custom cookie can include any of the cookie attributes required by the application.
