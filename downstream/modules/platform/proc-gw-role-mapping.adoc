= Role mapping

Role mapping is the mapping of a user either to a global role, such as Platform Auditor, or team or organization role.

When a Team and/or Organization is specified together with the appropriate Role, the behavior is identical with Organization mapping or Team mapping. 

Role mapping can be specified separately for each account authentication.

.Procedure

. After configuring the authentication details for your authentication type, select *Team* from the *Add authentication mapping* list. 
. Enter a unique rule *Name* to identify the rule.
. Select a *Trigger* from the list. See xref:gw-authenticator-map-triggers[Authenticator map triggers] for more information about map triggers.
. Select *Revoke* to remove the role for the user when none of the trigger conditions are matched. 
. Select a *Role* to be applied or removed for matching users.
. Click btn:[Next].
