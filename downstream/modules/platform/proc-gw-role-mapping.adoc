= Role mapping

[role="_abstract"]
Role mapping is the mapping of a user either to a global role, such as Platform Auditor, or team or organization role.

When a Team or Organization is specified together with the appropriate Role, the behavior is the same with Organization mapping or Team mapping. 

You can specify role mapping separately for each account authentication.

.Procedure

. After configuring the authentication details for your authentication method, select the *Mapping* tab.
. Select *Role* from the *Add authentication mapping* list. 
. Enter a unique rule *Name* to identify the rule.
. Select a *Trigger* from the list. See xref:gw-authenticator-map-triggers[Authenticator map triggers] for more information about map triggers.
. Select *Revoke* to remove the role for the user when none of the trigger conditions are matched. 
. Select a *Role* to be applied or removed for matching users.
. Click btn:[Next].
