= Setting up Prometheus

To set up and use Prometheus, you must install Prometheus on a virtual machine or container. 

For more information, see the link:https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/[Prometheus documentation].

Use the following procedure to install Prometheus.

.Procedure
. In the Prometheus configuration file (typically `prometheus.yml`), specify a `<token_value>`, a valid username and password for an {ControllerName} user that you have created, and a `<controller_host>`.
+
[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, you can provide an OAuth2 token (which can be generated at `/api/v2/users/N/personal_tokens/`). 
By default, the configuration assumes a user with username=`admin` and password=`password`.
====
+
Using an OAuth2 Token, created at the `/api/v2/tokens` endpoint to authenticate Prometheus with {ControllerName}, the following example provides a valid scrape configuration if the URL for your {ControllerName}'s metrics endpoint is `https://controller_host:443/metrics`.

For help configuring other aspects of Prometheus, such as alerts and service discovery configurations, see the link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/[Prometheus configuration documentation].
+
If Prometheus is already running, you must restart it to apply the configuration changes by making a *POST* to the reload endpoint, or by killing the Prometheus process or service.

. Use a browser to navigate to your graph in the Prometheus UI at `http://<your_prometheus>:9090/graph` and test out some queries. 
For example, you can query the current number of active {ControllerName} user sessions by executing: `awx_sessions_total{type="user"}`.

Refer to the metrics endpoint in the {ControllerName} API for your instance (`api/v2/metrics`) for more ways to query.
