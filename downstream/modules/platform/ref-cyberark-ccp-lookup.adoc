= CyberArk Central Credential Provider (CCP) Lookup

The CyberArk Central Credential Provider web service must be running to store secrets for this integration to work. 
When *CyberArk Central Credential Provider Lookup* is selected for *Credential Type*, it requires the following metadata to properly configure your lookup:

* *CyberArk CCP URL* (required): provide the URL used for communicating with CyberArk CCP's secret management system. 
It must include URL scheme (http, https, etc.)
* Optional: *Web Service ID*: specify the identifier for the web service. 
Leaving this blank defaults to AIMWebService
* *Application ID* (required): specify the identifier given by CyberArk CCP services
* *Client Key*: paste the client key if provided by CyberArk
* *Client Certificate*: include the `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` and `END CERTIFICATE` lines when pasting the certificate, if provided by
CyberArk
* *Verify SSL Certificates*: this option is only available when the URL uses HTTPS. 
Check this option to verify the server's SSL certificate is valid and trusted. 
Environments that use internal or private CA's must leave this option unchecked to disable verification.

The following is an example of a configured CyberArk CCP credential.
