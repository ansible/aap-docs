You can configure `metrics-utility` to run at specified times and intervals. Run frequency is expressed in cronjobs. For more information on the cron utility, see link:https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/linux-cron-command[How to schedule jobs using the Linux `Cron` utility]. 

To modify the run schedule on {RHEL} and on {OCPShort}, use one of the following procedures:

`*/5 * * * *     metrics-utility build_report`

. Save and close the file.
