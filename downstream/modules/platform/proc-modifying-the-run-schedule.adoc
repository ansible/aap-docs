.Procedure

. From the navigation panel, select menu:Workloads[Deployments].
. On the next screen, select *automation-controller-operator-controller-manager*.
. Beneath the heading *Deployment Details*, click the down arrow button to change the number of pods to zero. This will pause the deployment so you can update the running schedule. 
. From the navigation panel, select *Installed Operators*. From the list of installed operators, select {PlatformNameShort}. 
. On the next screen, select the {ControllerName} tab. 
. From the list that appears, select your {ControllerName} instance. 
. On the next screen, select the `YAML` tab. 
. In the `YAML` file, find the following parameters and enter a variable representing how often `metrics-utility` should gather data and how often it should produce a report:

. Click btn:[Save].
. From the navigation menu, select menu:Deployments[] and then select *automation-controller-operator-controller-manager*.
. Increase the number of pods to 1.
. To verify that you have changed the `metrics-utility` running schedule successfully, you can take one or both of the following steps:
.. return to the `YAML` file and ensure that the parameters described above reflect the correct variables.  
.. From the navigation menu, select menu:Workloads[Cronjobs] and ensure that your cronjobs show the updated schedule.
