= Modifying the run schedule

You can configure `metrics-utility` to run at specified times and intervals. Run frequency is expressed in cronjobs. For more information on the cron utility, see link:https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/linux-cron-command[How to schedule jobs using the Linux ‘Cron’ utility]. 

To modify the run schedule on {RHEL} and on {OCPShort}, use one of the following procedures:

.Procedure
 
. From the command line, run: 
+
`crontab -e`

+
`*/2 * * * *     metrics-utility gather_automation_controller_billing_data --ship --until=10m`
+
`*/5 * * * *     metrics-utility build_report`

. Save and close the file.
