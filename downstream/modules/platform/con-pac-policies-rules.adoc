= Understanding OPA packages and rules

[role="_abstract"]
An OPA policy is organized in packages, which are namespaced collections of rules. The basic structure of an OPA policy looks like this: 

[source,rego]
----
package aap_policy_examples  # Package name

import rego.v1  # Import required for Rego v1 syntax

# Rules define the policy logic
allowed := {
    "allowed": true,
    "violations": []
}
----

The key components of the rule's structure are: 

Package declaration:: This defines the namespace for your policy.
Rules:: This defines the policy's logic and the decision that it returns.

These components together form the OPA policy name, with the format `[package]/[rule]`. Enter the OPA policy name when you configure enforcement points.
