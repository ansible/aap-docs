= Product Notification Feed

[role="_abstract"]

Effective July 2025, the {PlatformNameShort} RSS notification feed will be available.
This feed serves as a method for communicating various product updates and changes to customers.

Customers can subscribe to the notifications by visiting announcements.ansiblecloud.redhat.com/feed.atom through an RSS feed reader. This feed is updated with events such as {PlatformNameShort} upgrades and system maintenance.

All {PlatformNameShort} customers can subscribe to this content. 
Messages include categorization tags to specify deployment types: managed, self-managed (on-prem), or a combination. 
Red Hat is developing a future enhancement to integrate this feature directly into the UI.
