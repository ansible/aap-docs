= Soft deletion

Soft deletion enables the removal of decommissioned hosts from the Host Metrics view and excludes them from any potential managed node counting. 
Additionally,  the following host types can also be deleted: 

* Ephemeral, uniquely provisioned hosts, such as those used for CI-CD, or testing only.
* Bench provisioning or temporary hosts.
* Older hosts that have been decommissioned and are never automated against.

Soft deletion is intended for legitimate use case scenarios only. 
It must not be used to violate subscription counting, for example, for the purposes of node recycling.
