Callbacks also require a host config key, to ensure that foreign hosts with the URL cannot request configuration. 
Give a custom value for the *Host config key*. 
The host key can be reused across many hosts to apply this job template against multiple hosts.
If you want to control what hosts are able to request configuration, you can change the key can at any time.
