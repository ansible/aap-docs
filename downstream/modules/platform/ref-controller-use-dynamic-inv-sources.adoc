= Use dynamic inventory sources

[role="_abstract"]
Define an inventory synchronization process by using dynamic sources, such as a cloud provider or CMDB, to help ensure your infrastructure inventory in {ControllerName} stays consistently up-to-date.

[NOTE]
====
Edits and additions to Inventory host variables persist beyond an inventory synchronization as long as `--overwrite_vars` is *not* set.
