= Selecting a date range for your CCSP report

[role="_abstract"]
By default, the CCSPv2 report generates data for the previous calendar month. You can override this behavior by specifying a different month when you run the `metrics-utility build_report` command.

The default behavior of this report is to build a report for the previous month. The following examples describe how to override this default behavior to select a specific date range for your report: 

----
# Builds report for a previous month
metrics-utility build_report

# Build report for a specific month
metrics-utility build_report --month=2025-03 

# Build report for a specific month overwriting an existing report
metrics-utility build_report --month=2025-03 --force
----
