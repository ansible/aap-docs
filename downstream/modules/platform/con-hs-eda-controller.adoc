= Horizontal scaling in {EDAcontroller} 

With {EDAcontroller}, you can set up horizontal scaling for your events automation. This multi-node deployment enables you to define as many nodes as you prefer during the installation process. You can also increase or decrease the number of nodes at any time according to your organizational needs.

The following node types are used in this deployment:

API node type:: Responds to the HTTP REST API of {EDAcontroller}.
Worker node type:: Runs an {EDAName} worker, which is the component of Event-Driven Ansible that not only manages projects and activations, but also executes the activations themselves.
Hybrid node type:: Is a combination of the API node and the worker node.

The following example shows how you would set up an inventory file for horizontal scaling of {EDAcontroller} on {RHEL} VMs using the host group name `[automationedacontroller]` and the node type variable `eda_node_type`:
