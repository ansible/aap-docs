= {PlatformName} system requirements

Your system must meet the following minimum system requirements to install and run {PlatformName}. 
A resilient deployment requires 10 virtual machines with a minimum of 16 gigabytes(GB) of ram and 4 virtual cpus(vCPU). 
See, link:{LinkTopologies} for more information on topology options.

| Requirement | Required | Notes

h| Subscription | Valid {PlatformName} |

h| OS | {RHEL} 9.2 or later x86_64 aarch64 |{PlatformName} is also supported on OpenShift, see link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/deploying_the_red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_operator_on_openshift_container_platform/index[Deploying the {PlatformName} operator on {OCPShort}] for more information.

h| Ansible-core | Ansible-core version {CoreInstVers} or later | {PlatformNameShort} uses the system-wide ansible-core package to install the platform, but uses ansible-core {CoreUseVers} for both its control plane and built-in execution environments.

[NOTE]
====
These are minimum requirements and can be increased for larger workloads in increments of 2x (for example 16GB becomes 32GB and 4 vCPU becomes 8vCPU). See the horizontal scaling guide for more information.
====

The following are necessary for you to work with project updates and collections:

* Ensure that the link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_planning_guide/ref-network-ports-protocols_planning[network ports and protocols] listed in _Table 5.3. Automation Hub_ are available for successful connection and download of collections from {HubName} or {Galaxy} server.

.Additional notes for {PlatformName} requirements

* If performing a bundled {PlatformNameShort} installation, the installation setup.sh script attempts to install ansible-core (and its dependencies) from the bundle for you.

* If you have installed Ansible-core manually, the {PlatformNameShort} installation setup.sh script detects that Ansible has been installed and does not attempt to reinstall it.

[NOTE]
====
You must use Ansible-core, which is installed via dnf.
Ansible-core version {CoreInstVers} is required for versions {PlatformVers} and later.
