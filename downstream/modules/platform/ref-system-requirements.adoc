.Base system

[cols="a,a,a"]
|===
| Requirement | Required | Notes

h| Subscription | Valid {PlatformName} |

h| OS | {RHEL} 8.8 or later 64-bit (x86, ppc64le, s390x, aarch64) |{PlatformName} is also supported on OpenShift, see link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/deploying_the_red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_operator_on_openshift_container_platform/index[Deploying the {PlatformName} operator on {OCPShort}] for more information.

h| Ansible-core | Ansible-core version {CoreInstVers} or later | {PlatformNameShort} uses the system-wide ansible-core package to install the platform, but uses ansible-core {CoreUseVers} for both its control plane and built-in execution environments.

h| Python | 3.11 or later |

h| Browser | A currently supported version of Mozilla FireFox or Google Chrome |

|===

The following are necessary for you to work with project updates and collections:

* Ensure that the link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_planning_guide/ref-network-ports-protocols_planning[network ports and protocols] listed in _Table 5.3. Automation Hub_ are available for successful connection and download of collections from {HubName} or {Galaxy} server.
* Disable SSL inspection either when using self-signed certificates or for the Red Hat domains.

[NOTE]
====
The requirements for systems managed by {PlatformNameShort} are the same as for Ansible.
See link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#prerequisites[Installing Ansible] in the Ansible Community Documentation.

.Additional notes for {PlatformName} requirements

* {PlatformName} depends on Ansible Playbooks and requires the installation of the latest stable version of ansible-core. You can download ansible-core manually or download it automatically as part of your installation of {PlatformName}.

* For new installations, {ControllerName} installs the latest release package of ansible-core.

* If performing a bundled {PlatformNameShort} installation, the installation setup.sh script attempts to install ansible-core (and its dependencies) from the bundle for you.

* If you have installed Ansible manually, the {PlatformNameShort} installation setup.sh script detects that Ansible has been installed and does not attempt to reinstall it.

[NOTE]
====
You must install Ansible using a package manager such as `dnf`, and the latest stable version of the package manager must be installed for {PlatformName} to work properly.
Ansible-core version {CoreInstVers} is required for versions {PlatformVers} and later.
