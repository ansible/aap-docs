To expand job capacity, create a standalone *execution node* that can be added to run alongside a deployment of {ControllerName}.
These execution nodes are not part of the {ControllerName} Kubernetes cluster.

The control nodes run in the cluster connect and submit work to the execution nodes through Receptor.

These execution nodes are registered in {ControllerName} as type `execution` instances, meaning they are only used to run jobs, not dispatch work or handle web requests as control nodes do.

*Hop nodes* can be added to sit between the control plane of {ControllerName} and standalone execution nodes.
These hop nodes are not part of the Kubernetes cluster and are registered in {ControllerName} as an instance of type `hop`, meaning they only handle inbound and outbound traffic for otherwise unreachable nodes in different or more strict networks.

The following procedure demonstrates how to set the node type for the hosts.

.Procedure
//[ddacosta]Removed specified panel to simplify changes in the future.
. From the navigation panel, select {MenuInfrastructureInstances}.
. On the *Instances* list page, click btn:[Add instance].
The *Add Instance* window opens.

+
An instance requires the following attributes:

* *Host name*: (required) Enter a fully qualified domain name (public DNS) or IP address for your instance. This field is equivalent to `hostname` for installer-based deployments.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the instance uses private DNS that cannot be resolved from the control cluster, DNS lookup routing fails, and the generated SSL certificates is invalid.
Use the IP address instead.
====
+
* Optional: *Description*: Enter a description for the instance.
* *Instance state*: This field is auto-populated, indicating that it is being installed, and cannot be modified.
* *Listener port*: This port is used for the receptor to listen on for incoming connections.
You can set the port to one that is appropriate for your configuration.
This field is equivalent to `listener_port` in the API.
The default value is 27199, though you can set your own port value.
* *Instance type*: Only `execution` and `hop` nodes can be created.
Operator based deployments do not support Control or Hybrid nodes.
+
Options:

** *Enable instance*: Check this box to make it available for jobs to run on an execution node.
** Check the *Managed by policy* box to enable policy to dictate how the instance is assigned.
** Check the *Peers from control nodes* box to enable control nodes to peer to this instance automatically.
For nodes connected to {ControllerName}, check the *Peers from Control* nodes box to create a direct communication link between that node and {ControllerName}.
For all other nodes:

*** If you are not adding a hop node, make sure *Peers from Control* is checked.
*** If you are adding a hop node, make sure *Peers from Control* is not checked.
*** For execution nodes that communicate with hop nodes, do not check this box.
** To peer an execution node with a hop node, click the image:search.png[Search,15,15] icon next to the *Peers* field.
+
The Select Peers window is displayed.
+
Peer the execution node to the hop node.

[NOTE]
====
Execute the following steps from any computer that has SSH access to the newly created instance.
====

. Click the image:download.png[Download,15,15] icon next to *Download Bundle* to download the tar file that includes this new instance and the files necessary to install the created node into the {AutomationMesh}.
//+
//image::instances_install_bundle.png[Install instance]
+
The install bundle contains TLS certificates and keys, a certificate authority, and a proper Receptor configuration file.
+
----
receptor-ca.crt
work-public-key.pem
receptor.key
install_receptor.yml
inventory.yml
group_vars/all.yml
requirements.yml
----

. Extract the downloaded `tar.gz` Install Bundle from the location where you downloaded it.
To ensure that these files are in the correct location on the remote machine, the install bundle includes the `install_receptor.yml` playbook.
The playbook requires the Receptor collection.
Run the following command to download the collection:
+
----
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
----

. Before running the `ansible-playbook` command, edit the following fields in the `inventory.yml` file:
+
----
all:
  hosts:
    remote-execution:
      ansible_host: 10.0.0.6
      ansible_user: <username> # user provided
  ansible_ssh_private_key_file: ~/.ssh/<id_rsa>
----

* Ensure `ansible_host` is set to the IP address or DNS of the node.
* Set `ansible_user` to the username running the installation.
* Set `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` to contain the filename of the private key used to connect to the instance.
* The content of the `inventory.yml` file serves as a template and contains variables for roles that are applied during the installation and configuration of a receptor node in a mesh topology.
You can modify some of the other fields, or replace the file in its entirety for advanced scenarios.
For more information, see link:https://github.com/ansible/receptor-collection/blob/main/README.md[Role Variables].
. For a node that uses a private DNS, add the following line to `inventory.yml`:
+
----
 ansible_ssh_common_args: <your ssh ProxyCommand setting>
----
+
This instructs the `install-receptor.yml` playbook to use the proxy command to connect through the local DNS node to the private node.

. When the attributes are configured, click btn:[Save].
The *Details* page of the created instance opens.

. Save the file to continue.
. The system that is going to run the install bundle to setup the remote node and run `ansible-playbook` requires the `ansible.receptor` collection to be installed:
+
----
ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.receptor
----
+
or
+
----
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
----
+
* Installing the receptor collection dependency from the `requirements.yml` file consistently retrieves the receptor version specified there.
Additionally, it retrieves any other collection dependencies that might be needed in the future.
* Install the receptor collection on all nodes where your playbook will run, otherwise an error occurs.

. If `receptor_listener_port` is defined, the machine also requires an available open port on which to establish inbound TCP connections, for example, 27199.
Run the following command to open port 27199 for receptor communication:
+
----
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=27199/tcp
----

. Run the following playbook on the machine where you want to update your automation mesh:
+
----
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml install_receptor.yml
----
+
After this playbook runs, your automation mesh is configured.
