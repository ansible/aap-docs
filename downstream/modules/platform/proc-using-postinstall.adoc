= Using the postinstall feature of containerized {PlatformNameShort}

[role="_abstract"]


You can use the optional postinstall feature of containerized {PlatformNameShort} to define and load the configuration during the initial installation. This uses a configuration-as-code approach, where you simply define your configuration to be loaded as YAML files. 

.Prerequisites
* An {PlatformNameShort} license for this feature that is on the local filesystem so it can be automatically loaded from the inventory file.


.Procedure
. The postinstall feature is disabled by default. To use the postinstaller, uncomment the following variables in your inventory file:
+
----
controller_postinstall=true
controller_license_file=<full_path_to_your_manifest_zip_file>
----
+
. You can pull your configuration-as-code from a Git based repository. To do this, set the following variables to dictate where you pull the content from and where to store it for upload to the {PlatformNameShort} controller:
+
----
controller_postinstall_repo_url=<url_to_your_config-as-code_git_repository>
controller_postinstall_dir=<full_path_to_your_config-as-code_directory>
controller_postinstall_repo_ref=main
----
+
. The `controller_postinstall_repo_url` variable can define the postinstall repository URL which must include authentication information.

+
----
http(s)://<host>/<repo>.git (public repository without HTTP(S) authentication)
http(s)://<user>:<password>@<host>:<repo>.git (private repository with HTTP(S) authentication)
git@<host>:<repo>.git (public or private repository with SSH authentication)
----
+

[NOTE]
====
When using SSH based authentication, the installer does not configure anything for you, so you must configure everything on the installer node.

Definition files that are used by Ansible Builder to create automation execution environment images use the link:https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/namespaces/infra/[infra certified collections]. The link:https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/validated/infra/controller_configuration/[controller_configuration] collection is preinstalled as part of the installation and uses the installation controller credentials you supply in the inventory file for access into the {PlatformNameShort} controller. You simply need to give the YAML configuration files. 

You can set up {PlatformNameShort} configuration attributes such as credentials, LDAP settings, users and teams, organizations, projects, inventories and hosts, job and workflow templates.

The following example shows a sample `your-config.yml` file defining and loading controller job templates. The example demonstrates a simple change to the  example provided with an {PlatformNameShort} installation.
