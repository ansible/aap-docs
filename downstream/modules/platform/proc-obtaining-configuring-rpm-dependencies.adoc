= Obtain and configure RPM source dependencies

[role="_abstract"]
The {PlatformNameShort} containerized setup bundle installation program does not include RPM source dependencies from the BaseOS and AppStream repositories. It relies on the host system's package manager to resolve these dependencies.

.Procedure
. Use one of the following methods to access these dependencies in a disconnected environment:

* Use link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_satellite/6.16/html/installing_satellite_server_in_a_disconnected_network_environment/index[Red Hat Satellite] to synchronize repositories in your disconnected environment.
* Use a local repository that you create with the `reposync` command on a {RHEL} host that has an active internet connection.
* Use a local repository that you create from a mounted {RHEL} Binary DVD ISO image.
