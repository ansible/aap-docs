= Obtaining and configuring RPM source dependencies

[role="_abstract"]
The {PlatformNameShort} containerized setup bundle installation program does not include RPM source dependencies from the BaseOS and AppStream repositories. It relies on the host system's package manager to resolve these dependencies.

To access these dependencies in a disconnected environment, you can use one of the following methods:

* Use link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_satellite/6.16/html/installing_satellite_server_in_a_disconnected_network_environment/index[Red Hat Satellite] to synchronize repositories in your disconnected environment.
* Use a local repository that you create with the `reposync` command on a {RHEL} host that has an active internet connection.
* Use a local repository that you create from a mounted {RHEL} Binary DVD ISO image.
