= `grpc_settings.py` file

[role="_abstract"]
Platform administrators can use the `grpc_settings.py` file to define special or custom parameters for the gRPC server. 

There are two gRPC settings files: the default `grpc_default.py` that is part of the codebase and must not be edited, and an override file that can be used to override the default values. The `grpc_default.py` file includes database keepalive OPTIONS to help maintain a healthy gRPC connection and prevent interruptions. If it was necessary to change these defaults, the `grpc_settings.py` file can be used to override values from the `grpc_defauly.py` file.

The location and management of the override `grpc_settings.py` file can differ based on your deployment (RPM-based, {ContainerBase} or {OperatorBase}). 

== RPM deployments

The override `grpc_settings.py` file in an RPM-based setup can be edited directly, and changes take effect after restarting the gateway systemd service. If you choose to edit the file, be sure to use the proper syntax and values. The override `grpc_settings.py` file is located in the following directory:

/etc/ansible-automation-platform/gateway/grpc_settings.py
