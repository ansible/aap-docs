= Build-time configuration over dynamic runtime configuration

[role="_abstract"]

Add the configuration to the operating system image at build time.
Adding the configuration at build time ensures that the configurations are tested, distributed, and updated together.
In cases when build-time configuration is not feasible or desirable, you can dynamically configure devices at runtime instead with the {RedHatEdge}.

Dynamic runtime configuration is preferable in the following cases:

* You have a configuration that is deployment or site-specific, such as a hostname or a site-specific network credential.
* You have secrets that are not secure to distribute with the image.
* You have application workloads that need to be added, updated, or deleted without reboot or they are on a faster cadence than the operating system.
