= Changing TLS certificates and keys using the installation program

[role="_abstract"]
You can change the TLS certificates and keys for your container-based {PlatformNameShort} installation. This process involves a preparation step, either providing new custom certificates or deleting or moving the old certificates, followed by running the installation program.

The following procedure describes how to update the TLS certificates and keys by using the installation program.

.Procedure
. To prepare the certificates and keys, choose one of the following methods:
** To provide custom certificates - For each service that requires updated TLS certificates, copy the new certificates and keys to a path relative to the {PlatformNameShort} installer. Then update the inventory file variables with the absolute paths to the new files.

. After preparing your certificates, run the `install` playbook from your installation directory:
+
----
ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file_name> ansible.containerized_installer.install
----

.Verification

Verify that the new TLS certificates are in use by checking that the services are running and accessible. To do this, check a specific endpoint by using `curl`:

----
$ curl -vk https://<hostname_or_ip>:<port_number>/api/v2/
----

The output of this command gives details about the TLS handshake. Look for the following output to confirm the correct certificate is being used:

----
*  SSL certificate verify OK
