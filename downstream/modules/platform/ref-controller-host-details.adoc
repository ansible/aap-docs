= Hosts

//Does this need to be a  procedure or can it be left a ref.

A system managed by {PlatformNameShort}, which may include a physical, virtual, cloud-based server, or other device. 
Typically a host is an operating system instance. 
Hosts are contained in Inventory and are sometimes referred to as a “node”.
Ansible works against multiple managed nodes or “hosts” in your infrastructure at the same time, using a list or group of lists known as an inventory. 
Once your inventory is defined, you use patterns to select the hosts or groups you want Ansible to run against.
