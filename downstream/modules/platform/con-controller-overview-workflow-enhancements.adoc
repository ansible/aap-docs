= Workflow enhancements

To model your complex provisioning, deployment, and orchestration workflows, you can use {ControllerName} expanded workflows in several ways:

* *Inventory overrides for Workflows* You can override an inventory across a workflow at workflow definition time, or at launch time.
Use {ControllerName} to define your application deployment workflows, and then re-use them in many environments.
* *Convergence nodes for Workflows* When modeling complex processes, you must sometimes wait for many steps to finish before proceeding.
{ControllerNameStart} workflows can replicate this; workflow steps can wait for any number of earlier workflow steps to complete properly before proceeding.
* *Workflow Nesting* You can re-use individual workflows as components of a larger workflow.
Examples include combining provisioning and application deployment workflows into a single workflow.
* *Workflow Pause and Approval* You can build workflows containing approval nodes that require user intervention.
This makes it possible to pause workflows in between playbooks so that a user can give approval (or denial) for continuing on to the next step in the workflow.
