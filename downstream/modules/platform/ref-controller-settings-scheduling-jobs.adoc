= Settings for scheduling jobs

The task manager periodically collects tasks that need to be scheduled and determines what instances have capacity and are eligible for running them. The task manager has the following workflow:

. Find and assign the control and execution instances.
. Update the job's status to waiting.
. Message the control node through `pg_notify` for the dispatcher to pick up the task and start running it.

If the scheduling task is not completed within `TASK_MANAGER_TIMEOUT` seconds (default 300 seconds), the task is terminated early. Timeout issues generally arise when there are thousands of pending jobs.

One way the task manager limits how much work it will do in a single run is the setting `START_TASK_LIMIT`. This limits how many jobs it will start in a single run. The default is 100 jobs. If more jobs are pending, a new scheduler task is scheduled to run immediately after. Users who are willing to have potentially longer latency between when a job is launched and when it starts, in order to have greater overall throughput, may consider increasing the `START_TASK_LIMIT`. To see how long individual runs of the task manager take, use the Prometheus metric `task_manager__schedule_seconds`, available in `/api/v2/metrics`.

Jobs elected to begin running by the task manager do not do so until the task manager process exits and commits its changes. The setting `TASK_MANAGER_TIMEOUT` determines how long a single run of the task manager will run for before committing its changes. When the task manager reaches its timeout, it will attempt to commit any progress it made. The task is not actually forced to exit until after a grace period (determined by `TASK_MANAGER_TIMEOUT_GRACE_PERIOD`) has passed.
