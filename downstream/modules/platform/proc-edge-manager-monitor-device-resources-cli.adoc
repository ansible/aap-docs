= Monitoring device resources on the CLI

Monitor the resources of your device through the CLI, providing you with the tools and commands to track performance and troubleshoot issues.

.Procedure

* Add resource monitors in the `resources:` section of the device's specification.

For example, add the following monitor for your disk:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: flightctl.io/v1alpha1
kind: Device
metadata:
  name: <device_name>
spec:
[...]
  resources:
  - monitorType: Disk
    samplingInterval: 5s <1> 
    path: /application_data <2>
    alertRules:
    - severity: Warning <3>
      duration: 30m
      percentage: 75
      description: Disk space for application data is >75% full for over 30m.
    - severity: Critical <4>
      duration: 10m
      percentage: 90
      description: Disk space for application data is >90% full over 10m.
[...]
----
<1> Samples usage every 5 seconds.
<2> Checks disk usage on the file system that is associated with the `/applications_data` path. 
<3> Initiates a warning if the average usage exceeds 75% for more than 30 minutes.
