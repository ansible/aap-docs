= Generate reports to show ephemeral usage

[role="_abstract"]
The `metrics-utility` command-line tool can generate reports showing ephemeral usage of managed nodes.

The `RENEWAL_GUIDANCE` report has the capability to list additional sheets with ephemeral usage if the `-ephemeral` parameter is provided. Using the parameter `--ephemeral=1month`, you can define ephemeral nodes as any managed node that has been automated for a maximum of one month, then never automated again. Using this parameter, the total ephemeral usage of the 12-month period is computed as maximum ephemeral nodes used over all 1-month rolling date windows. This sheet is also added into the report.

----
# Will generate report for 12 months back with ephemeral nodes being nodes  
# automated for less than 1 month.
