= Extra variables

When you pass survey variables, they are passed as extra variables (`extra_vars`) within the controller.
However, passing extra variables to a job template (as you would do with a survey) can override other variables being passed from the inventory and project.

[NOTE]
====
`extra_vars` passed to the job launch API are only honored if one of the following is true:

* They correspond to variables in an enabled survey.
* `ask_variables_on_launch` is set to *True*.
====

.Example
You have a defined variable for an inventory for `debug = true`.
It is possible that this variable, `debug = true`, can be overridden in a job template survey.

To ensure the variables that you pass are not overridden, ensure they are included by redefining them in the survey.
Extra variables can be defined at the inventory, group, and host levels.

If you are specifying the `ALLOW_JINJA_IN_EXTRA_VARS` parameter, see the link:http://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/4.4/html/administration/tipsandtricks.html#ag-tips-jinja-extravars[Controller Tips and Tricks] section of the Automation Controller Administration Guide to configure it in the *Jobs Settings* screen of the controller UI.

The job template extra variables dictionary is merged with the survey variables.

The following are some simplified examples of extra_vars in YAML and JSON formats:

* The configuration in YAML format:
----
launch_to_orbit: true
satellites:
  - sputnik
  - explorer
  - satcom
----

* The configuration in JSON format:
----
{
  "launch_to_orbit": true,
  "satellites": ["sputnik", "explorer", "satcom"]
}
----

The following table notes the behavior (hierarchy) of variable precedence in {ControllerName} as it compares to variable precedence in Ansible.
