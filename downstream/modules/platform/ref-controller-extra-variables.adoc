[id="controller-extra-variables"]

= Extra variables

When you pass survey variables, they are passed as extra variables (`extra_vars`) within {ControllerName}.
However, passing extra variables to a job template (as you would do with a survey) can override other variables being passed from the inventory and project.

By default, `extra_vars` are marked as `!unsafe` unless you specify them on the Job Template's Extra Variables section. 
These are trusted, because they can only be added by users with enough privileges to add or edit a Job Template. 
For example, nested variables do not expand when entered as a prompt, as the Jinja brackets are treated as a string.
For more information about unsafe variables, see link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_advanced_syntax.html#unsafe-or-raw-strings[Unsafe or raw strings]. 

[NOTE]
====
`extra_vars` passed to the job launch API are only honored if one of the following is true:

* They correspond to variables in an enabled survey.
* `ask_variables_on_launch` is set to *True*.
====

.Example
You have a defined variable for an inventory for `debug = true`.
It is possible that this variable, `debug = true`, can be overridden in a job template survey.

To ensure the variables that you pass are not overridden, ensure they are included by redefining them in the survey.
Extra variables can be defined at the inventory, group, and host levels.

If you are specifying the `ALLOW_JINJA_IN_EXTRA_VARS` parameter, see the link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.4/html-single/automation_controller_administration_guide/index[Controller Tips and Tricks] section of the _{ControllerAG}_ to configure it in the *Jobs Settings* screen of the controller UI.

The job template extra variables dictionary is merged with the survey variables.

The following are some simplified examples of `extra_vars` in YAML and JSON formats:

* The configuration in YAML format:
----
launch_to_orbit: true
satellites:
  - sputnik
  - explorer
  - satcom
----

* The configuration in JSON format:
----
{
  "launch_to_orbit": true,
  "satellites": ["sputnik", "explorer", "satcom"]
}
----

The following table notes the behavior (hierarchy) of variable precedence in {ControllerName} as it compares to variable precedence in Ansible.
