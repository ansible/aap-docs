= Preparing the managed nodes for containerized installation

Managed nodes, also referred to as hosts, are the devices that {PlatformNameShort} is configured to manage.

To ensure a consistent and secure setup of containerized {PlatformNameShort}, create a dedicated user on each host. {PlatformNameShort} connects as this user to run tasks on the host.

Once configured, you can define the dedicated user for each host by adding `ansible_user=<username>` in your inventory file, for example: `aap.example.org ansible_user=aap`.

.Procedure

Complete the following steps for each host:

. Log in to the host as the root user.
. Create a new user. Replace `<username>` with the username you want, for example `aap`.
+
----
$ adduser <username>
----
+
. Set a password for the new user. Replace `<username>` with the username you created.
+
----
$ passwd <username>
----
+
. Configure the user to run sudo commands.
.. To do this open the sudoers file:
+
----
$ vi /etc/sudoers
----
+
.. Add the following line to the file (replacing `<username>` with the username you created):
+
----
<username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
----
+
.. Save and exit the file.
