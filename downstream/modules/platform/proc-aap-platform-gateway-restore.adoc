= Restore {PlatformNameShort}

[role="_abstract"]

*{PlatformNameShort}* manages any enabled components (such as, {ControllerName}, {HubName}, and {EDAName}), when you recover *{PlatformNameShort}* you also restore these components.

In previous versions of the {OperatorPlatformNameShort}, it was necessary to create a restore object for each component of the platform. 
Now, you create a single *AnsibleAutomationPlatformRestore* resource, which  creates and manages the other restore objects: 

* AutomationControllerRestore
* AutomationHubRestore
* EDARestore

.Prerequisites

* You must be authenticated with an OpenShift cluster.
* You have installed the {OperatorPlatformNameShort} on the cluster.
* The *AnsibleAutomationPlatformBackups* deployment is available in your cluster.

.Procedure 

. Log in to {OCP}.
. Navigate to menu:Operators[Installed Operators].
. Select your {OperatorPlatformNameShort} deployment.
. Go to your *All Instances* tab, and click btn:[Create New].
. Select *{PlatformNameShort} Restore* from the list.
. For *Name* enter the name for the recovery deployment. 
. For *New {PlatformNameShort} Name* enter the new name for your {PlatformNameShort} instance. 
. *Backup Source* defaults to *CR*.
. For *Backup name* enter the name you chose when creating the backup. 
. Click btn:[Create].
