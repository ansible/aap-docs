+
. You can configure the following options:

* *Ansible Modules Allowed For Ad Hoc Jobs*: List of modules allowed to be used by ad hoc jobs.
+
The directory in which the service creates new temporary directories for job execution and isolation (such as credential files).
*  *When can extra variables contain Jinja templates?*: Ansible allows variable substitution through the Jinja2 templating language for `--extra-vars`. 
+
This poses a potential security risk where users with the ability to specify extra vars at job launch time can use Jinja2 templates to run arbitrary Python. 
+
Set this value to either `template` or `never`.
+
* *Paths to expose to isolated jobs*: List of paths that would otherwise be hidden to expose to isolated jobs. 
+
Enter one path per line. If a path to a specific file is entered, then the entire directory containing that file will be mounted inside the {ExecEnvShort}.
+
Volumes are mounted from the execution node to the container. 
+
The supported format is `HOST-DIR[:CONTAINER-DIR[:OPTIONS]]`.
+
* *Extra Environment Variables*: Additional environment variables set for playbook runs, inventory updates, project updates, and notification sending.
* *K8S Ansible Runner Keep-Alive Message Interval*: Only applies to jobs running in a Container Group. 
+
If not 0, send a message every specified number of seconds to keep the connection open.
+
* *Environment Variables for Galaxy Commands*: Additional environment variables set for invocations of ansible-galaxy within project updates. 
Useful if you must use a proxy server for ansible-galaxy but not git.
* *Standard Output Maximum Display Size*: Maximum Size of Standard Output in bytes to display before requiring the output be downloaded.
*  *Job Event Standard Output Maximum Display Size*: Maximum Size of Standard Output in bytes to display for a single job or ad hoc command event. stdout ends with `…` when truncated.
* *Job Event Maximum Websocket Messages Per Second*: The maximum number of messages to update the UI live job output with per second. 
+
A value of 0 means no limit.
* *Maximum Scheduled Jobs*: Maximum number of the same job template that can be waiting to run when launching from a schedule before no more are created.
* *Ansible Callback Plugins*: List of paths to search for extra callback plugins to be used when running jobs. 
* *Default Job Timeout*: If no output is detected from ansible in this number of seconds the execution will be terminated. 
+
Use a value of 0 to indicate that no idle timeout should be imposed.
+
Enter one path per line.
* *Default Job Idle Timeout*: If no output is detected from ansible in this number of seconds the execution will be terminated. 
+
Use a value of 0 to indicate that no idle timeout should be imposed.
* *Default Inventory Update Timeout*: Maximum time in seconds to allow inventory updates to run. 
+
Use a value of 0 to indicate that no timeout should be imposed. 
+
A timeout set on an individual inventory source will override this.
* *Default Project Update Timeout*: Maximum time in seconds to allow project updates to run. 
+
Use a value of 0 to indicate that no timeout should be imposed. 
+
A timeout set on an individual project will override this.
* *Per-Host Ansible Fact Cache Timeout*: Maximum time, in seconds, that stored Ansible facts are considered valid since the last time they were modified. 
+
Only valid, non-stale, facts are accessible by a playbook. 
+
This does not influence the deletion of `ansible_facts` from the database. 
+
Use a value of 0 to indicate that no timeout should be imposed.
* *Maximum number of forks per job*: Saving a Job Template with more than this number of forks results in an error.
+
When set to 0, no limit is applied.
* *Job execution path*: Only available in operator-based installations. 
* *Container Run Options*: Only available in operator-based installations. 
+
List of options to pass to Podman run example: `['--network', 'slirp4netns:enable_ipv6=true', '--log-level', 'debug']`.
+
You can set the following options:
+
* *Run Project Updates With Higher Verbosity*: Select to add the CLI `-vvv` flag to playbook runs of `project_update.yml` used for project updates
* *Enable Role Download*: Select to allow roles to be dynamically downloaded from a `requirements.yml` file for SCM projects.
* *Enable Collection(s) Download*: Select to allow collections to be dynamically downloaded from a `requirements.yml` file for SCM projects.
* *Follow symlinks*: Select to follow symbolic links when scanning for playbooks. 
+
Be aware that setting this to `True` can lead to infinite recursion if a link points to a parent directory of itself.
* *Expose host paths for Container Groups*: Select to expose paths through hostPath for the Pods created by a Container Group. 
+
HostPath volumes present many security risks, and it is best practice to avoid the use of HostPaths when possible.
+
*Ignore Ansible Galaxy SSL Certificate Verification*: If set to `true`, certificate validation is not done when installing content from any Galaxy server.
