= {PlatformNameShort} installation on disconnected RHEL

[role="_abstract"]
You can install {PlatformNameShort} without an internet connection by using the installer-managed database located on the {ControllerName}. The setup bundle is recommended for disconnected installation because it includes additional components that make installing {PlatformNameShort} easier in a disconnected environment. These include the {PlatformNameShort} Red Hat package managers (RPMs) and the default {ExecEnvShort} (EE) images.
