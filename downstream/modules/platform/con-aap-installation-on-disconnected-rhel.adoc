== Prerequisites

To install {PlatformNameShort} on a disconnected network, complete the following prerequisites:

* Create a subscription manifest.
* Download the {PlatformNameShort} setup bundle.
* Create DNS records for {ControllerName} and private automation hub servers.

NOTE: The setup bundle includes additional components that make installing {PlatformNameShort} easier in a disconnected environment. These include the {PlatformNameShort} RPMs and the default {ExecEnvShort} (EE) images.
