= {PlatformNameShort} installation on disconnected RHEL

[role="_abstract"]
You can install {PlatformNameShort} {ControllerName} and {PrivateHubName} without an internet connection by using the installer-managed database located on the {ControllerName}. Use the setup bundle for a disconnected installation as it includes additional components that make installing {PlatformNameShort} easier in a disconnected environment. These include the {PlatformNameShort} Red Hat package managers (RPMs) and the default {ExecEnvShort} (EE) images.

== System requirements for disconnected installation

Ensure that your system has all the hardware requirements before performing a disconnected installation of {PlatformNameShort}. For more information about hardware requirements, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html-single/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_installation_guide/index#platform-system-requirements[Chapter 2. System requirements].

== RPM Source

RPM dependencies for {PlatformNameShort} that come from the BaseOS and AppStream repositories are not included in the setup bundle. To add these dependencies, you must first obtain access to BaseOS and AppStream repositories. Use Satellite to sync repositories and add dependencies. If you prefer an alternative tool, you can choose between the following options:

* Reposync
* The RHEL Binary DVD

[NOTE]

====
The RHEL Binary DVD method requires the DVD for supported versions of RHEL, including version 8.6 or higher. See link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle] for information about which versions of RHEL are currently supported.
