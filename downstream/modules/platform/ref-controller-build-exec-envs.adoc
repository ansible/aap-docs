= Building an {ExecEnvShort}

If your Ansible content depends on custom virtual environments instead of a default environment, you must take additional steps.
You must install packages on each node, interact well with other software installed on the host system, and keep them in synchronization. 
//Before, jobs ran in a virtual environment at `/var/lib/awx/venv/ansible`, which was pre-loaded with dependencies for ansible-runner and certain types of Ansible content used by the Ansible control machine.

To simplify this process, you can build container images that serve as Ansible
link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/getting_started/basic_concepts.html#control-node[Control nodes]. 
These container images are referred to as automation {ExecEnvShort}s, which you can create with ansible-builder.
Ansible-runner can then make use of those images.
