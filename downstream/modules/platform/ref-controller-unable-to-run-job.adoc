= Unable to run a job

[role="_abstract"]
If you are unable to run a job from a playbook, review the playbook YAML file. 
When importing a playbook, either manually or by a source control mechanism, remember that the host definition is controlled by {ControllerName} and should be set to `hosts:all`.
