= Rule files

You can define device lifecycle hooks by adding rule files to one of the following locations in the device file system:

* Rules in the `/usr/lib/flightctl/hooks.d/<lifecycle_hook_name>/` drop-in directory are read-only. 
To add rules to the `/usr` directory, you must add them to the operating system image during image building.
* Rules in the `/etc/flightctl/hooks.d/<lifecycle_hook_name>/` drop-in directory are read-writable. 
You can update the rules at runtime by using several methods. 

When creating and placing the files, you must consider the following practices:

* The name of the rule must be all lower case.
* If you define rules in both locations, the rules are merged.
* If you add more than one rule files to a lifecycle hook directory, the files are processed in lexical order of the file names.
* If you define files with identical file names in both locations, the file in the `/etc` folder takes precedence over the file of the same name in the `/usr` folder.

A rule file is written in YAML format and has a list of one or more actions. 
An action can be an instruction to run an external command.

When you specify many actions for a hook, the actions are performed in sequence, finishing one action before starting the next. 

If an action returns with a failure, the following actions are skipped.

A `run` action takes the following parameters:

|===
|Parameter | Description
|`Run` | The absolute path to the command to run, followed by any flags or arguments, for example `/usr/bin/nmcli connection reload`. The command is not executed in a shell, so you cannot use shell variables, such as `$PATH` or `$HOME`, or chain commands, such as `\|` or `;`. If necessary, you can start a shell by specifying the shell as command to run, for example `/usr/bin/bash -c 'echo $SHELL $HOME $USER'`.

|`EnvVars` | Optional. A list of key-value pairs to set as environment variables for the command.

|`WorkDir` | Optional. The directory the command is run from.

|`Timeout` | Optional. The maximum duration that is allowed for the action to complete. Specify the duration as a single positive integer followed by a time unit. The `s`, `m`, and `h` units are supported for seconds, minutes, and hours.

|`If` | Optional. A list of conditions that must be true for the action to be run. If not provided, actions run unconditionally.
|===

By default, the system performs actions every time the hook is triggered. 
However, for the `afterUpdating` hook, you can use the `If` parameter to add conditions that must be true for an action to be performed. 
Otherwise, the action is skipped. 

For example, to run an action only if a given file or directory changes during the update, you can define a path condition that takes the following parameters:

|===
|Parameter | Description
| `Job type` a| An absolute path to a file or directory that must change during the update as a condition for the action to be performed. Specify paths by using forward slashes (/):

- If the path is to a directory, it must end with a forward slash (`/`). 

- If you specify a path to a file, the file must have changed to satisfy the condition

- If you specify a path to a directory, a file in that directory or any of its subdirectories must have changed to satisfy the condition

|`Op` | A list of file operations, such as `created`, `updated`, and `removed`, to limit the type of changes to the specified path as a condition for the action to be performed.
|===

If you specify a path condition for an action in the `afterUpdating` hook, you have the following variables that you can include in arguments to your command and are replaced with the absolute paths to the changed files:

|===
|Variable | Description
|`${ Path }` | The absolute path to the file or directory specified in the path condition.

|`${ Files }` | A space-separated list of absolute paths of the files that changed during the update and are covered by the path condition.

|`${ CreatedFiles }` | A space-separated list of absolute paths of the files that were created during the update and are covered by the path condition.

|`${ UpdatedFiles }` | A space-separated list of absolute paths of the files that were updated during the update and are covered by the path condition.

|`${ RemovedFiles }` | A space-separated list of absolute paths of the files that were removed during the update and are covered by the path condition.

The {RedHatEdge} agent includes a built-in set of rules defined in `/usr/lib/flightctl/hooks.d/afterupdating/00-default.yaml`. 
The following commands are executed if certain files are changed:

|===
|File | Command | Description
|`/etc/systemd/system/` | `systemctl daemon-reload` | Changes to `systemd` units are activated by signaling the `systemd` daemon to reload the `systemd` manager configuration. This reruns all generators, reloads all unit files, and re-creates the entire dependency tree.

|`/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/` |`nmcli conn reload` | Changes to `NetworkManager` system connections are activated by signaling the `NetworkManager` daemon to reload all connections. For more information, see the _Additional resources_ section.

|`/etc/firewalld/` | `firewall-cmd --reload` | Changes to the permanent configuration of `firewalld` are activated by signaling `firewalld` to reload firewall rules as new runtime configuration.
