= Post upgrade

It is imperative that administrators verify the assigned permissions for all teams in the platform-wide authentication gateway immediately after the upgrade:

* Ensure the transferred team members have the correct access rights in the Ansible Automation Platform environment based on the filesystem.  
* Make sure all members that have been merged are, in fact, the same member. Incorrect permissions could lead to access issues or security vulnerabilities.

* When upgrade to {PlatformNameShort} 2.6 is complete, user accounts that exist in both the {HubName} and {ControllerName} systems will be unified, and {Gateway} IAM will be the source of truth for users after the data movement. 
* {HubNameStart} and {EDAName} users must either be recreated or the users that moved from {ControllerName} given permission to use those services.

After your upgrade to {ControllerName} 2.6 is complete, verify that you can log in to the upgraded platform with your existing controller credentials (username/password).

[NOTE]
====
To do this, you have must have a controller account on {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 or 2.5 with administrative privileges.

The following table provides next steps for each type of user after they have upgraded.

| If you are this type of user before upgrading:| Then take these actions after the upgrade:
| An {ControllerName} administrator (no {HubName} account) |
Log in with your {ControllerName} username and password; you are now a gateway administrator.
| An {ControllerName} normal user (no {HubName} account) |
Log in with your {ControllerName} username and password; you are now a gateway normal user.
| A {HubName} user (no {ControllerName} account) |
Request a password reset from your administrator. When you log in with your new password you will be a gateway normal user. You will retain your hub-related permissions. 
| An {ControllerName} and {HubName} user (with the same username in both services) |
Log in with your {ControllerName} username and password; your previous two accounts will be merged and you are now a gateway normal user.
| An {HubName} user with SSO (no {ControllerName} account) |
Log in with your SSO credentials; you are now a gateway normal user.
