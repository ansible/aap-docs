= Connecting nodes through mesh ingress

If you are using a network which restricts or does not permit inbound connections, using an instance to set up a hop node peered to the control plane can cause problems. 
Creating a hop node instance also requires that the hop node has a 'listener_port' set up for internal connections. 
There is, however, an alternative method of setting up an automation mesh, using _mesh ingress_.

When you instantiate mesh ingress you set up a pod, or receptor hop node inside the kubernetes control cluster, registered to the database through the operator. 
It also creates a service, and a route URL that is used by the control plane to connect to the hop node, and {ControllerName}.

.Prerequisites

* Create node instances within the remote networks for execution nodes in the automation mesh.

Use the following procedure to set up mesh nodes.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file to  set up the mesh ingress node.
+
The file resembles the following:
+
----
apiVersion:
kind: AutomationControllerMeshIngress
metadata:
    name:
    namespace:
spec:
    deployment name: 
----
+
Where:

* *apiVersion*: defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. 
Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and might reject unrecognized values.
* *kind*: Is the type of node to create. 
Set the value to `AutomationControllerMeshIngress`. 
`AutomationControllerMeshIngress` controls the deployment and configuration of mesh ingress on {ControllerName}.
* *name*: is the name of the mesh ingress node.
* *namespace*: is which Kubernetes namespace to deploy the mesh ingress into.
This must be in the same namespace as the {ControllerName} that the mesh is connected to
* *deployment_name*: You can find the deployment name by using:
+
----
oc get ansible-automation-platform.
----
+
//Additionally you can use:
+
//* *external_hostname*: an optional field used for specifying the external hostname defined in an user managed ingress.
//* *external_ipaddress*: an optional field used for specifying the external IP address defined in an user managed ingress
//* *ingress_type*: Ingress type for ingress managed by the operator.
//Where options are:  
//** none (default) 
//** Ingress
//** IngressRouteTCP
//** Route (default when deployed on OpenShift)
//* *ingress_api_version*: the API Version for ingress managed by the operator. 
//This parameter is ignored when `ingress_type=Route`.
//* *ingress_annotations*: annotation on the ingress managed by the operator
//* *ingress_class_name*: the name of ingress class to use instead of the cluster default. 
//This parameter is ignored when `ingress_type=Route`.
//* *ingress_controller*: special configuration for specific Ingress Controllers. 
//This parameter is ignored when `ingress_type=Route`.

. Apply this YAML file using:
+
----
oc apply -f oc_meshingress.yml
----
+
This runs the playbook associated with `AutomationControllerMeshIngress`, and creates the hop node called `<name>`.

. When the MeshIngress instance has been created, it appears in the Instances page.
