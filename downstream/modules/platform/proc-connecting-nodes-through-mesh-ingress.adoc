= Connecting nodes through mesh ingress

[role="_abstract"]
If you are using a network which restricts or does not permit inbound connections, using an instance to set up a hop node peered to the control plane can cause problems. 
Creating a hop node instance also requires that the hop node has a 'listener_port' set up for internal connections. 
There is, however, an alternative method of setting up an automation mesh, using _mesh ingress_.

When you instantiate mesh ingress you set up a pod, or receptor hop node inside the kubernetes control cluster, registered to the database through the operator. 
It also creates a service, and a route URL that is used by the control plane to connect to the hop node, and {ControllerName}.

.Prerequisites

* Create node instances within the remote networks for execution nodes in the automation mesh.

Use the following procedure to set up mesh nodes.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file (in this case named `oc_meshingress.yml`) to  set up the mesh ingress node.
+
Your file should resemble the following:
+
----
apiVersion: automationcontroller.ansible.com/v1alpha1
kind: AutomationControllerMeshIngress
metadata:
    name:
    namespace:
spec:
    deployment_name: aap-controller
----
+
Where:

* *apiVersion*: defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. 
Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and might reject unrecognized values.
This value is static.
* *kind*: Is the type of node to create. 
+
Use the value `AutomationControllerMeshIngress`. 
+
`AutomationControllerMeshIngress` controls the deployment and configuration of mesh ingress on {ControllerName}.
* *name*: enter a name for the mesh ingress node.
* *namespace*: enter a name for the Kubernetes namespace to deploy the mesh ingress into.
+
This must be in the same namespace as the {ControllerName} that the mesh is connected to.
* *deployment_name*: is the {ControllerName} instance that this mesh ingress is attached to.
Provide the name of your {ControllerName} instance.

. Apply this YAML file using:
+
----
oc apply -f oc_meshingress.yml
----
+
Run this playbook to creates the `AutomationControllerMeshIngress` resource. 
The operator creates a hop node in {ControllerName} with the `name` you supplied.

. When the MeshIngress instance has been created, it appears in the Instances page.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Any instance that is to function as a remote execution node in "pull" mode need to be created after this procedure and must be configured as follows:
----
instance type: Execution
listener port: keep empty
options:
    Enable instance: checked
    Managed by Policy: as needed
    Peers from control nodes: unchecked (this one is important)
----
====
. Associate this new instance with the hop node you created using the procedure in this paragraph
. Download the tarball.
+
[NOTE]
====
Association with the hop node must be done before creating the tarball.
