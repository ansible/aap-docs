= Build and use an {ExecEnvShort}

All automation in Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform runs on container images called {ExecEnvName}s.

{ExecEnvNameStart} are consistent and shareable container images that serve as Ansible control nodes. 
{ExecEnvNameStart} reduce the challenge of sharing Ansible content that has external dependencies. 
If automation content is like a script that a developer has written, an automation {ExecEnvShort} is like a replica of that developer's environment, thereby enabling you to reproduce and scale the automation content that the developer has written. In this way, {ExecEnvShort}s make it easier for you to implement automation in a range of environments.

{ExecEnvNameStart}s contain: 

* Ansible Core
* {Runner}
* Ansible Collections
* Python libraries
* System dependencies
* Custom user needs

You can either use the default base {ExecEnvShort} included in your {PlatformNameShort} subscription, or you can define and create an {ExecEnvNameSing} using {Builder}.
