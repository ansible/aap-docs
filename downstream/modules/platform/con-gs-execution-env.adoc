= Build and use an {ExecEnvShort}

{ExecEnvNameStart} are consistent and shareable container images that serve as Ansible control nodes. 
{ExecEnvNameStart} reduce the challenge of sharing Ansible content that has external dependencies. 
If automation content is like a script that a developer has written, an automation {ExecEnvShort} is like a replica of that developer's environment, thereby enabling you to reproduce and scale the automation content that the developer has written.

{ExecEnvNameStart}s make it easier for you to implement automation in a range of environments.
