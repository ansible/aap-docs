= `settings.py` file

[role="_abstract"]
As a platform administrator, you can modify the `settings.py` file to configure various aspects of {PlatformNameShort}, such as database connections, logging configurations, caching, and more.

There are two `settings.py` files; the default `settings.py` that is part of the codebase and must not be edited, and an override file that can be used to override the default values. 

The location and management of the override `settings.py` file can differ based on your deployment (RPM-based, {ContainerBase}, or {OperatorBase}). 

== RPM deployments

The override `settings.py` file in an RPM-based setup can be edited directly, and changes take effect after restarting the {Gateway} service. If you choose to edit the file, be sure to use the proper syntax and values. The override `settings.py` file is located in the following directory:

----
/etc/ansible-automation-platform/gateway/settings.py
----

== Container-based deployments
For {ContainerBase} deployments, {PlatformNameShort} runs within containers and the `settings.py` file is included inside the container. However, directly editing the `settings.py` file in {ContainerBase} deployments is not recommended because the `settings.py` file is overwritten during upgrades or new installs. 

To customize settings in {ContainerBase} deployments, you can use the `extra_settings` parameter to ensure that customizations persist through installer updates. For more information, see link:{URLContainerizedInstall}/appendix-inventory-files-vars[Inventory file variables] in the {TitleContainerizedInstall} guide. 

== Operator-based deployments

For {OperatorBase} deployments, the `settings.py` file is typically located inside the container, however, users cannot modify the `settings.py` files directly in the container because containers in {OCP} are read-only.

Instead, for operator-based deployments, you can modify the settings for the {Gateway} using the `spec.extra_settings` parameter on the {PlatformNameShort} custom resource.
