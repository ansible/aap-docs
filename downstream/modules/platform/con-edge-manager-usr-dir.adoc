= Configuration in the `/usr` directory

[role="_abstract"]
Place configuration files in the `/usr` directory if the configuration is static and the application or service supports that configuration.
By placing the configuration in the `/usr` directory, the configuration remains read-only and fully defined by the image.

Do not place the configuration in the `/usr` directory in the following cases:

* The configuration is deployment or site-specific.
* The application or service only supports reading configuration from the `/etc` directory.
* The configuration might need to be changed at runtime.
