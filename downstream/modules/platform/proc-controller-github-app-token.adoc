[role="_abstract"]
Learn how to configure a `GitHub App Installation Access Token Lookup` credential in {ControllerName}.

With this plugin you can use a private GitHub App RSA key as a credential input source to pull access tokens from GitHub App installations.
{GatewayStart} uses existing GitHub authorization from organizations' GitHub repositories.

. Select *GitHub App Installation Access Token Lookup* for *Credential type*, and enter the following attributes to properly configure your lookup:

** *GitHub App ID*: Enter the App ID provided by your instance of GitHub, this is what is used to authenticate.
** *GitHub App Installation ID*: Enter the ID of the application into your target organization where the access token is scoped. 
You must set it up to have access to your target repository.
** *RSA Private Key*: Enter the generated private key that your GitHub instance generated. 
You can get it from the GitHub App maintainer within GitHub.
