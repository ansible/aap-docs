= Update the operating system

You can update the operating system of a device by updating the target operating system image name or version in the device specification.
When the agent communicates with the server, the agent detects the requested update.
Then, the agent automatically starts downloading and verifying the new operating system version in the background.
The {RedHatEdge} agent schedules the actual system update that is performed according to the update policy.
At the scheduled update time, the agent installs the new version without disrupting the currently running operating system.
Finally, the device reboots into the new version.

The {RedHatEdge} currently supports the following image type and image reference format:

[width="100%",cols="40%,60%",options="header",]
|===
|Image Type |Image Reference
|bootc|An OCI image reference to a container registry. Example: `quay.io/flightctl-example/rhel:9.5`
|===

During the process, the agent sends status updates to the service.
You can check the update process by viewing the device status.
