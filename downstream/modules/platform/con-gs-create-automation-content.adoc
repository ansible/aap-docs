= Create automation content with playbooks

[role="_abstract"]
Ansible playbooks are blueprints that tell {PlatformNameShort} what tasks to perform with which devices. 
Use a playbook to define automation tasks for the platform to run. 

== Create a playbook

A playbook contains one or more plays. A basic play contains the following parameters:

* *Name*: a brief description of the overall function of the playbook, which assists in keeping it readable and organized for all users. 
* *Hosts*: identifies the target or targets for Ansible to run against.
* *Become statements*: this optional statement can be set to `true` or `yes` to enable privilege escalation using a become plugin (such as `sudo`, `su`, `pfexec`, `doas`, `pbrun`, `dzdo`, `ksu`).
* *Tasks*: this is the list of actions that get executed against each host in the play. 

Here is an example of a play in a playbook. You can see the name of the play, the host, and the list of tasks included in the play. 

[source,bash]
