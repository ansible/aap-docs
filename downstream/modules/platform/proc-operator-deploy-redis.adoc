= Deploying Redis on {OperatorPlatformName}

[role="_abstract"]

When you create an {PlatformNameShort} instance through the {OperatorPlatformNameShort}, standalone Redis is assigned by default. 
If you would prefer to deploy clustered Redis, you can use the following procedure.

For more information about Redis, refer to Caching and queueing system in the _Planning your installation_ guide.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Switching Redis modes on an existing instance is not supported and can lead to unexpected consequences, including data loss. 
To change the Redis mode, you must deploy a new instance.
