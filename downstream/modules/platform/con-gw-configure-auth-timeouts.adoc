= Configure authenticator timeouts

[role="_abstract"]

{PlatformNameShort} uses a system of layered timeouts for password-based authenticators such as LDAP, RADIUS, and TACACS+. 
To prevent authentication requests from failing, configure each timeout setting in relation to the others. 
The principle is that each upstream timeout should be slightly longer than the sum of its downstream timeouts.

The system processes authentication requests through a chain of services, each with its own timeout setting:

* *Envoy timeout*: The total time a request can take before the initial entry point (Envoy) terminates the connection. 
This is the highest-level timeout.
* *gRPC timeout*: A downstream timeout that bounds the time spent communicating with the internal authentication service.
* *Authenticator timeout*: The lowest-level timeout, which defines how long an individual authenticator (LDAP, RADIUS, TACACS+) waits for a response from its third-party server.
