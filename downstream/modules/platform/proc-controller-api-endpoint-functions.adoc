= API endpoint functions

The API lists only non-deleted records and are sortable by `last_automation` and `used_in_inventories` columns.

Alternatively, you can use the host metric API endpoint,`api/v2/host_metric` to soft-delete hosts:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
api/v2/host_metric <n> DELETE
----

A monthly scheduled task automatically deletes jobs that uses hosts from the Host Metric table that were last automated more than a year ago.
