= Collections support

[role="_abstract"]
{ControllerNameStart} supports project-specific Ansible collections in job runs. 

If you specify a collections requirements file in the SCM at `collections/requirements.yml`, {ControllerName} installs collections in that file in the implicit project synchronization before a job run.

{ControllerNameStart} has a system-wide setting that enables collections to be dynamically downloaded from the `collections/requirements.yml` file for SCM projects. 
You can turn off this setting in the *Job Settings* screen from the navigation panel {MenuSetJob}, by unchecking the *Enable Collection(s) Download*
box.

Roles and collections are locally cached for performance reasons, and you select *Update revision on launch* in the project *Options* to ensure this:

[NOTE]
====
If you also have collections installed in your {ExecEnvShort}, the collections specified in the project's `requirements.yml` file will take precedence when running a job. This precedence applies regardless of the version of the collection. For example, if the collection specified in `requirements.yml` is older than the collection within the {ExecEnvShort}, the collection specified in `requirements.yml` is used.
