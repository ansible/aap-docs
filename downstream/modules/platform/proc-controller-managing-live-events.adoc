= Managing live events in the {ControllerName} UI

Events are sent to any node where there is a UI client subscribed to a job. This task is expensive, and becomes more expensive as the number of events that the cluster is producing increases and the number of control nodes increases, because all events are broadcast to all nodes regardless of how many clients are subscribed to particular jobs.

To reduce the overhead of displaying live events in the UI, administrators can choose to either:

* Disable live streaming events.
* Reduce the number of events shown per second or before truncating or hiding events in the UI.

When you disable live streaming of events, they are only loaded on hard refresh to a job's output detail page. When you reduce the number of events shown per second, this limits the overhead of showing live events, but still provides lives updates in the UI without a hard refresh.
