* Add your service account to the Subscription viewer user group to give it the ability to see your subscriptions. See the "Updates to subscription management" section in the Knowledgebase article link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7112649[Configure {PlatformNameShort} to authenticate through service account credentials] for instructions on how to do so.

.Procedure

. To add your subscription by uploading a subscription manifest:
.. Drag the file to the field beneath *Red Hat subscription manifest* or browse for the file on your local machine.
. To add your subscription with your service account credentials:
.. Click the *Service Account* tab.
.. Enter the *client ID* you received when you created your service account in the field labeled Client ID. 
.. Enter the *client secret* you received when you created your service account in the field labeled Client secret.

. Select your subscription.
.. After you have added your subscription, click btn:[Next].
.. Check the box indicating that you agree to the *End User License Agreement*.

.Troubleshooting
If you enter your client ID and client secret but cannot locate your subscription, you might not have the correct permissions set on your service account. For more information and troubleshooting guidance for service accounts, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7112649[Configure Ansible Automation Platform to authenticate through service account credentials].
