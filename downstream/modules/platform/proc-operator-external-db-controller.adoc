= Configuring an external database for {ControllerName} on {OperatorPlatformName}

[role="_abstract"]

For users who prefer to deploy {PlatformNameShort} with an external database, they can do so by configuring a secret with instance credentials and connection information, then applying it to their cluster using the `oc create` command.

By default, the {OperatorPlatformNameShort} automatically creates and configures a managed PostgreSQL pod in the same namespace as your {PlatformNameShort} deployment. You can deploy {PlatformNameShort} with an external database instead of the managed PostgreSQL pod that the {OperatorPlatformNameShort} automatically creates.

Using an external database lets you share and reuse resources and manually manage backups, upgrades, and performance optimizations.

[NOTE]
====
The same external database (PostgreSQL instance) can be used for both {HubName}, {ControllerName}, and {Gateway} as long as the database names are different. In other words, you can have multiple databases with different names inside a single PostgreSQL instance.
====

The following section outlines the steps to configure an external database for your {ControllerName} on a {OperatorPlatformNameShort}.

.Prerequisite
The external database must be a PostgreSQL database that is the version supported by the current release of {PlatformNameShort}. The external postgres instance credentials and connection information must be stored in a secret, which is then set on the {ControllerName} spec.

[NOTE]
====
{PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers} supports {PostgresVers} for its managed databases and additionally supports PostgreSQL 15, 16, and 17 for external databases.

If you choose to use an externally managed database with version 16 or 17 you must also rely on external backup and restore processes.

.Procedure

. Create a `postgres_configuration_secret` YAML file, following the template below:
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: external-postgres-configuration
  namespace: <target_namespace>
stringData:
  host: "<external_ip_or_url_resolvable_by_the_cluster>"
  port: "<external_port>"
  database: "<desired_database_name>"
  username: "<username_to_connect_as>"
  password: "<password_to_connect_with>"
  sslmode: "prefer"
  type: "unmanaged"
type: Opaque
----
+
When configuring the secret:
+
* `namespace`: Specify the namespace to create the secret in. This should be the same namespace you want to deploy to.
* `host`: Specify the resolvable hostname for your database node.
* `port`: Specify the external port. The default is `5432`.
* `password`: Ensure the password does not contain single or double quotes (', ") or backslashes (\) to avoid any issues during deployment, backup or restoration.
* `sslmode`: This variable is valid for external databases only. The allowed values are: `prefer`, `disable`, `allow`, `require`, `verify-ca`, and `verify-full`.
. Apply `external-postgres-configuration-secret.yml` to your cluster using the `oc create` command.
+
----
$ oc create -f external-postgres-configuration-secret.yml
----
. When creating your `AutomationController` custom resource object, specify the secret on your spec, following the example below:
+
----
apiVersion: automationcontroller.ansible.com/v1beta1
kind: AutomationController
metadata:
  name: controller-dev
spec:
  postgres_configuration_secret: external-postgres-configuration
