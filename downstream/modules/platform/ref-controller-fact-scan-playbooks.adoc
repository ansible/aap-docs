= Fact scan playbooks

The scan job playbook, `scan_facts.yml`, contains invocations of three `fact scan modules` - packages, services, and files, along with Ansible's standard fact gathering. 
The `scan_facts.yml` playbook file is similar to this:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
- hosts: all
  vars:
    scan_use_checksum: false
    scan_use_recursive: false
  tasks:
    - scan_packages:
    - scan_services:
    - scan_files:
        paths: '{{ scan_file_paths }}'
        get_checksum: '{{ scan_use_checksum }}'
        recursive: '{{ scan_use_recursive }}'
      when: scan_file_paths is defined
----
The `scan_files` fact module is the only module that accepts parameters, passed through `extra_vars` on the scan job template:

`scan_file_paths`: `/tmp/`
`scan_use_checksum`: true
`scan_use_recursive`: true

* The `scan_file_paths` parameter can have multiple settings (such as `/tmp/` or `/var/log`).
* The `scan_use_checksum` and `scan_use_recursive` parameters can also be set to false or omitted. 
An omission is the same as a false setting.

Scan job templates should enable `become` and use `credentials` for which `become` is a possibility. 
You can enable `become` by checking *Privilege Escalation* from the options list:
