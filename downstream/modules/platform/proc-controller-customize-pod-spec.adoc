= Customizing the pod specification

{PlatformNameShort} provides a simple default pod specification, however, you can provide a custom YAML or JSON document that overrides the default pod specification. 
This field uses any custom fields such as `ImagePullSecrets`, that can be "serialized" as valid pod JSON or YAML. 
A full list of options can be found in the link:https://docs.openshift.com/online/pro/architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html[Pods and Services] section of the OpenShift documentation.

.Procedure

. To customize the pod specification, specify the namespace in the *Pod Spec Override* field by using the toggle to enable and expand the *Pod Spec Override* field.

[NOTE]
====
The image when a job launches is determined by which {ExecEnvShort} is associated with the job. 
If you associate a container registry credential with the {ExecEnvShort}, then {ControllerName} attempts to make an `ImagePullSecret` to pull the image. 
If you prefer not to give the service account permission to manage secrets, you must pre-create the `ImagePullSecret` and specify it on the pod specification, and omit any credential from the {ExecEnvShort} used.

Once you have created the container group successfully, the *Details* tab of the newly created container group remains, which enables you to review and edit your container group information. 
This is the same menu that is opened if you click the image:leftpencil.png[Edit,15,15] icon from the *Instance Group* link. 
You can also edit *Instances* and review *Jobs* associated with this instance group.

Container groups and instance groups are labeled accordingly.
