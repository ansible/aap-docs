= Enabling HTTPS redirect for single sign-on (SSO) for {Gateway} on {OCPShort}

HTTPS redirect for SAML, allows you to log in once and access all of the {Gateway} without needing to reauthenticate.

.Prerequisites 

* You have successfully configured SAML in the gateway from the {OperatorPlatformNameShort}. Refer to link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html-single/access_management_and_authentication/index#controller-set-up-SAML[Configuring SAML authentication] for help with this.

.Procedure

. Log in to {OCP}.
. Go to menu:Operators[Installed Operators].
. Select your {OperatorPlatformNameShort} deployment.
. Select *All Instances* and go to your *AnsibleAutomationPlatform* instance.
. Click the  {MoreActionsIcon} icon and then select btn:[Edit AnsibleAutomationPlatform].
. In the *YAML view* paste the following YAML code under the `spec:` section:
+
----
spec:
  extra_settings:
    - setting: REDIRECT_IS_HTTPS
      value: '"True"'

----
+
. Click btn:[Save].

.Verification

After you have added the `REDIRECT_IS_HTTPS` setting, wait for the pod to redeploy automatically. You can verify this setting makes it into the pod by running:
----
oc exec -it <gateway-pod-name> -- grep REDIRECT /etc/ansible-automation-platform/gateway/settings.py
----
