= Upload a collection to {HubName}

[role="_abstract"]
If you want to share a collection that you have created with the rest of the Ansible community, you can upload it to {HubName}.

[NOTE]

====
Sharing a collection with the Ansible community requires getting the collection certified or validated by our Partner Engineering team. This action is available only to partner clients. For more about becoming a partner, see our link:https://connect.redhat.com/en/partner-resources/software-certification-documentation[documentation on software certification].
