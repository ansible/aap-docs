= Creating a role

You can create roles using the {Galaxy} CLI tool, which is included with your {PlatformNameShort} bundle. Access role-specific commands from the `role` subcommand:

[source,bash]
----
ansible-galaxy role init <role_name>
----

Standalone roles outside of Collections are supported.
Create new roles inside a Collection to take advantage of the features {PlatformNameShort} has to offer.

.Procedure

. In a terminal, navigate to the `roles` directory inside a collection.
. Create a role called `my_role` inside the collection:
+
----
$ ansible-galaxy role init my_role
----
+
The collection now includes a role named `my_role` inside the `roles` directory, as you can see in this example:
+
----
~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/<my_namespace>/<my_collection_name>
    ...
    └── roles/
        └── my_role/
            ├── .travis.yml
            ├── README.md
            ├── defaults/
            │   └── main.yml
            ├── files/
            ├── handlers/
            │   └── main.yml
            ├── meta/
            │   └── main.yml
            ├── tasks/
            │   └── main.yml
            ├── templates/
            ├── tests/
            │   ├── inventory
            │   └── test.yml
            └── vars/
                └── main.yml
----
. A custom role skeleton directory can be supplied by using the `--role-skeleton` argument.
This allows organizations to create standardized templates for new roles to suit their needs.
+
----
$ ansible-galaxy role init my_role --role-skeleton ~/role_skeleton
----
+
This creates a role named `my_role` by copying the contents of `~/role_skeleton` into `my_role`.
The contents of `role_skeleton` can be any files or folders that are valid inside a role directory.
