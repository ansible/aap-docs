[cols="25%,25%,30%,10%,10%",options="header"]
|===
| RPM variable name | Container variable name | Description | Required or optional | Default

| `receptor_datadir`
| 
| The directory where receptor stores its runtime data and local artifacts. +
The target directory must be accessible to *awx* users. +
If the target directory is a temporary file system *tmpfs*, ensure it is remounted correctly after a reboot. Failure to do so results in the receptor no longer having a working directory.
| Optional
| `/tmp/receptor`

| `receptor_listener_port` 
| `receptor_port` 
| Port number that receptor listens on for incoming connections from other receptor nodes.
| Optional
| `27199`

| `receptor_listener_protocol` 
| `receptor_protocol` 
| Protocol that receptor will support when handling traffic.
| Optional
| `tcp`

| `receptor_log_level`
| `receptor_log_level` 
| Controls the verbosity of logging for receptor. +
Valid options include: `error`, `warning`, `info`, or `debug`.
| Optional
| `info`

| `receptor_tls`
|
| Controls whether TLS is enabled or disabled for receptor.
Set this variable to `false` to disable TLS.
| Optional
| `true`

| See `node_type` for the RPM equivalent variable. 
| `receptor_type` 
a|
For the `[automationcontroller]` group the two options are:

* `receptor_type=control` - The node only runs project and inventory updates, but not regular jobs.
* `receptor_type=hybrid` - The node runs everything.

For the `[execution_nodes]` group the two options are:

* `receptor_type=hop` - The node forwards jobs to an execution node.
* `receptor_type=execution` - The node can run jobs.
| Optional
| For the `[automationcontroller]` group: `hybrid`. +
For the `[execution_nodes]` group: `execution`.

| See `peers` for the RPM equivalent variable 
| `receptor_peers` 
a| Used to indicate which nodes a specific host connects to. Wherever this variable is defined, an outbound connection to the specific host is established. The value must be a comma-separated list of hostnames. Do not use inventory group names.

This is resolved into a set of hosts that is used to construct the `receptor.conf` file.

endif::container-install[]

| Optional
| `[]`

| 
| `receptor_disable_signing` 
| Controls whether signing of communications between receptor nodes is enabled or disabled. +
Set this variable to `true` to disable communication signing.
| Optional
| `false`

| 
| `receptor_disable_tls` 
| Controls whether TLS is enabled or disabled for receptor. +
Set this variable to `true` to disable TLS.
| Optional
| `false`

| 
| `receptor_firewall_zone` 
| The firewall zone where receptor related firewall rules are applied. This controls which networks can access receptor based on the zone's trust level.
| Optional
| `public`

|
| `receptor_mintls13` 
| Controls whether or not receptor only accepts connections that use TLS 1.3 or higher. +
Set to `true` to only accept connections that use TLS 1.3 or higher.
| Optional
| `false`

| 
| `receptor_signing_private_key` 
| Path to the private key used by receptor to sign communications with other receptor nodes in the network. 
| Optional
|

| 
| `receptor_signing_public_key` 
| Path to the public key used by receptor to sign communications with other receptor nodes in the network.
| Optional
|

| 
| `receptor_signing_remote` 
| Denote whether the receptor signing files are local to the installation program (`false`) or on the remote component server (`true`).
| Optional
| `false`

| 
| `receptor_tls_cert` 
| Path to the TLS certificate file for receptor. 
| Optional
|

| 
| `receptor_tls_key` 
| Path to the TLS key file for receptor. 
| Optional
|

| 
| `receptor_tls_remote` 
| Denote whether the receptor provided certificate files are local to the installation program (`false`) or on the remote component server (`true`).
| Optional
| `false`

| 
| `receptor_use_archive_compression`
| Controls whether archive compression is enabled or disabled for receptor. You can control this functionality globally by using `use_archive_compression`.
| Optional
| `true`
