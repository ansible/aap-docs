[cols="50%,50%,50%",options="header"]
|====
| *RPM variable name* | *Container variable name* | *Description*

| | `receptor_disable_signing` | Disable receptor signing. 

Default = `false`

| | `receptor_disable_tls` | Disable receptor TLS. 

Default = `false`

| | `receptor_log_level` | Receptor logging level.

Default = `info`

| | `receptor_mintls13` | Receptor TLS 1.3 minimal. 

Default = `false`

| See `peers` for the RPM equivalent variable | `receptor_peers` | 

Used to indicate which nodes a specific host connects to. Wherever this variable is defined, an outbound connection to the specific host is established.

This variable can be a comma-separated list of hosts only and not groups from the inventory. This is resolved into a set of hosts that is used to construct the `receptor.conf` file.

For example usage, see link:{URLContainerizedInstall}/aap-containerized-installation#adding-execution-nodes_aap-containerized-installation[Adding execution nodes].

Default = []

| `receptor_datadir` | | This variable configures the receptor data directory. By default, it is set to `/tmp/receptor`. To change the default location, run the installation script with `"-e receptor_datadir="` and specify the target directory that you want. 

*NOTES*

* The target directory must be accessible to *awx* users. 

* If the target directory is a temporary file system *tmpfs*, ensure it is remounted correctly after a reboot. Failure to do so results in the receptor no longer having a working directory.

| `receptor_listener_port` | `receptor_port` | Receptor port number.

Default = `27199`

| `receptor_listener_protocol` | `receptor_protocol` | Receptor protocol.

Default = `tcp`

| | `receptor_signing_private_key` | Receptor signing private key. 
| | `receptor_signing_public_key` | Receptor signing public key. 
| | `receptor_signing_remote` | Receptor signing remote files. 

Default = `false`

| | `receptor_tls_cert` | Receptor TLS certificate. 
| | `receptor_tls_key` | Receptor TLS key. 
| | `receptor_tls_remote` | Receptor TLS remote files. 

Default = `false`

| See `node_type` for the RPM equivalent variable. | `receptor_type` a|

For the `[automationcontroller]` group the two options are:

* `receptor_type=control` - The node only runs project and inventory updates, but not regular jobs.

* `receptor_type=hybrid` - The node runs everything.

Default for this group = `hybrid`.

For the `[execution_nodes]` group the two options are:

* `receptor_type=hop` - The node forwards jobs to an execution node.
* `receptor_type=execution` - The node can run jobs.

Default for this group = `execution`
