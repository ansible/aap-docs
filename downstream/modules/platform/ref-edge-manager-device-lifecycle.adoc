= Use device lifecycle hooks

The {RedHatEdge} agent can run user-defined commands at specific points in the device lifecycle by using device lifecycle hooks. 
For example, you can add a shell script to your operating system images that backs up your application data. 
You can then specify that the script must run and complete successfully before the agent can start updating the operating system.

As another example, certain applications or system services do not automatically reload their configuration file when the file changes on the disk. 
You can manually reload the configuration file by specifying a command as another hook, which is called after the agent completes the update process.

The following device lifecycle hooks are supported:

|Lifecycle Hook |Description
|`beforeUpdating` |This hook is called after the agent completed preparing for the update and before actually making changes to the system. 
If an action in this hook returns with failure, the agent cancels the update.

|`afterUpdating` |This hook is called after the agent has written the update to disk. 
If an action in this hook returns with failure,the agent cancels and rolls back the update.

|`beforeRebooting` |This hook is called before the system reboots. The agent blocks the reboot until running the action has completed or timed out. 
If any action in this hook returns with failure, the agent cancels and rolls back the update.

|`afterRebooting` |This hook is called when the agent first starts after a reboot. 
If any action in this hook returns with failure, the agent reports this but continues starting up.
