= Setting registry_username and registry_password

If you intend to use the `registry_username` and `registry_password` variables in an inventory file you are recommended to use the following method to create a Registry Service Account to set a token with an expiration in the plaintext `inventory/vars.yml` file instead of using a plaintext username and password, for reasons of security.

Registry service accounts provide named tokens that can be used in environments where credentials are shared, such as deployment systems.

.Procedure
. Navigate to https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/accounts
. On the *Registry Service Accounts* page click btn:[New Service Account].
. Enter a name for the account using only the accepted characters.
. Optionally enter a description for the account.
. Click btn:[Create account].
. Find the created account in the list. 
The list of accounts is long so you might have to click btn:[Next] multiple times before finding the account you created. 
Alternatively, if you know the name of your token, you can go directly to the page by entering the URL \https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/token/<name-of-your-token>
. Click the name of the account that you created. 
. A *token* page opens, displaying a generated Username (different to the account name) and a token. 
+
If no Username and token are displayed, click btn:[Regenerate token]. You can also click this to generate a new Username and token.
. Copy the service account name and use it to set `registry_username`.
. Copy the token and use it to set `registry_password`.
