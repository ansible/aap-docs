= {GatewayStart} system requirements

The {Gateway} is the service that handles authentication and authorization for {PlatformNameShort}. It provides a single entry into the platform and serves the platform's user interface.

{GatewayStart} hosts check if `umask` is set to 0022. If not, the setup fails. Set `umask=0022` to avoid this error.
