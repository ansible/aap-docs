= Creating {PlatformNameShort} custom resources

Create an {PlatformNameShort} custom resource (CR) that specifies the names of your existing deployments, in the same namespace.

.Procedure

You can find examples for {PlatformNameShort} CR for various deployment scenarios in the xref:appendix-operator-crs_performance-considerations[Appendix]. 

. For example, use the fresh install {PlatformNameShort} CR (aap-fresh-install.yml).
. Wait for the {PlatformNameShort} CR to show the *Successful* status.
. Navigate to the Route URL listed in the status (or the *Routes* page) to access the new CR.

[NOTE]
====
You can override the operatorâ€™s default image for {ControllerName}, {HubName}, or platform-resource app images by specifying the preferred image on the YAML spec.
This enables upgrading a specific deployment, like a controller, without updating the operator.

The recommended approach however, is to upgrade the operator and use the default image values.
