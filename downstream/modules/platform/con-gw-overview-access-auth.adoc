{PlatformNameShort} features a platform interface where you can set up centralized authentication, configure access management, and configure global and system level settings from a single location.

The first time you log in to the {PlatformNameShort}, you must enter your subscription information to activate the platform. For more information about licensing and subscriptions, see link:{URLCentralAuth}/assembly-gateway-licensing[Managing {PlatformNameShort} licensing, updates and support]. 

A system administrator can configure access, permissions and system settings through the following tasks:

* xref:gw-configure-authentication[Configuring authentication in the {PlatformNameShort}], where you set up simplified login for users by selecting from several authentication methods available and define permissions and assign them to users with authenticator maps.

* xref:gw-token-based-authentication[Configuring access to external applications with token-based authentication], where you can configure authentication of third-party tools and services with the platform through integrated OAuth 2 token support.

* xref:gw-managing-access[Managing access with role based access control], where you configure user access based on their role within a platform organization.

* xref:assembly-gw-settings[Configuring {PlatformNameShort}], where you can configure global and system level settings for the platform and services.
