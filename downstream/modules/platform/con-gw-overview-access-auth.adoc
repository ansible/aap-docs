= Overview of access management and authentication

Ansible Automation Platform features a platform interface where you can set up centralized authentication, configure access management, and configure global and system level settings from a single location.

A system administrator can configure access, permissions and system settings through the following tasks:

xref:gw-configure-authentication[Configuring authentication in the Ansible Automation Platform], where you set up simplified login for users by selecting from several authentication methods available and define permissions and assign them to users with authenticator maps.

[XREF TBD]Configuring token-based authentication, where you can configure authentication of third-party tools and services with the platform through integrated OAuth 2 token support.

xref:gw-managing-access[Managing access with role based access control], where you configure user access based on their role within a platform organization.

[XREF TBD]Configuring Ansible Automation Platform, where you can configure global and system level settings for the platform and services.
