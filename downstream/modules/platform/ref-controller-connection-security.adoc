= Internal, external, and managed node connections 

[role="_abstract"]
{ControllerNameStart} allows for connections to internal services, external access, and managed nodes.

[NOTE]
====
You must have 'local' user access for the following users:

* postgres
* awx
* redis
* receptor
* nginx 
====

== Internal services

{ControllerNameStart} connects to the following services as part of internal operation:

PostgreSQL database::
The connection to the PostgreSQL database is done by password authentication over TCP, either through localhost or remotely (external database). 
This connection can use PostgreSQL's built-in support for SSL/TLS, as natively configured by the {Installer} support. 
SSL/TLS protocols are configured by the default OpenSSL configuration.

A Redis key or value store::
The connection to Redis is over a local UNIX socket, restricted to the awx service user.

==  External access

{ControllerNameStart} is accessed using standard HTTP/HTTPS on standard ports, provided by Nginx. 
A self-signed certificate or key is installed by default; you can provide a locally appropriate certificate and key. 

SSL/TLS algorithm support is configured in the `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` configuration file. 
An "intermediate" profile is used by default, that you can configure. 
You must reapply changes after each update.

== Managed nodes

{ControllerNameStart} connects to managed machines and services as part of automation. 
All connections to managed machines are done by standard secure mechanisms, such as SSH, WinRM, or SSL/TLS.

Each of these inherits configuration from the system configuration for the feature in question, such as the system OpenSSL configuration.
