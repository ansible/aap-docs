= Machine

Machine credentials enable {ControllerName} to invoke Ansible on hosts under your management. 
As with the Ansible command line, you can specify the SSH username, optionally provide a password, an SSH key, a key password, or have {ControllerName} prompt the user for their password at deployment time. 
They define SSH and user-level privilege escalation access for playbooks, and are used when submitting jobs to run playbooks on a remote host. 

Network connections (`httpapi`, `netconf`, and `network_cli`) use *Machine* as the credential type.

Machine/SSH credentials do not use environment variables. 
Instead, they pass the username through the ansible `-u` flag, and interactively write the SSH password when the underlying SSH client prompts for it.

Machine credentials require the following inputs:

* *Username*: The username to be used for SSH authentication.
* *Password*: The actual password to be used for SSH authentication.
This password will be stored encrypted in the database, if entered.
Alternatively, you can configure {ControllerName} to ask the user for the password at launch time by selecting *Prompt on launch*. 
In these cases, a dialog opens when the job is launched, promoting the user to enter the password and password confirmation.
* *SSH Private Key*: Copy or drag-and-drop the SSH private key for the machine credential.
* *Private Key Passphrase*: If the SSH Private Key used is protected by a password, you can configure a Key Password for the private key. 
This password is stored encrypted in the database, if entered.
Alternatively, you can configure {ControllerName} to ask the user for the password at launch time by selecting *Prompt on launch*. 
In these cases, a dialog opens when the job is launched, prompting the user to enter the password and password confirmation.
* *Privilege Escalation Method*: Specifies the type of escalation privilege to assign to specific users. 
This is equivalent to specifying the `--become-method=BECOME_METHOD` parameter, where `BECOME_METHOD` is any of the following methods, or a custom method you have written. 
Begin entering the name of the method, and the appropriate name auto-populates.

** *empty selection*: If a task/play has `become` set to `yes` and is used with an empty selection, then it will default to `sudo`
** *sudo*: Performs single commands with super user (root user) privileges
** *su*: Switches to the super user (root user) account (or to other user accounts)
** *pbrun*: Requests that an application or command be run in a controlled account and provides for advanced root privilege delegation and keylogging
** *pfexec*: Executes commands with predefined process attributes, such as specific user or group IDs
** *dzdo*: An enhanced version of sudo that uses RBAC information in an Centrify's Active Directory service.

** *pmrun*: Requests that an application is run in a controlled account. See link:http://documents.software.dell.com/privilege-manager-for-unix/6.0/administrators-guide/privilege-manager-programs/pmrun[Privilege Manager for Unix 6.0]
** *runas*: Enables you to run as the current user
** *enable*: Switches to elevated permissions on a network device
** *doas*: Enables your remote/login user to execute commands as another user through the _doas_ ("Do as user") utility
** *ksu*: Enables your remote/login user to execute commands as another user through Kerberos access
** *machinectl*: Enables you to manage containers throough the `systemd` machine manager
** *sesu*: Enables your remote/login user to execute commands as another user through the CA Privileged Access Manager

[NOTE]
====
Custom `become` plugins are available from Ansible 2.8+.
For more information, see link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_privilege_escalation.html[Understanding Privilege Escalation] and the list of link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/become.html#plugin-list[Become plugins]
====
* *Privilege Escalation Username*: this field is only seen if an option for privilege escalation is selected. 
Enter the username to use with escalation privileges on the remote system.
* *Privilege Escalation Password*: this field is only seen if an option for privilege escalation is selected. 
Enter the password to be used to authenticate the user through the selected privilege escalation type on
the remote system. 
This password is stored encrypted in the database, if entered. 
Alternatively, you can configure {ControllerName} to ask the user for the password at launch time by selecting
*Prompt on launch*. 
In these cases, a dialog opens when the job is launched, promoting the user to enter the password and password confirmation.

[NOTE]
====
Sudo Password must be used in combination with SSH passwords or SSH Private Keys, since {ControllerName} must first establish an authenticated SSH connection with the host before invoking `sudo` to change to the sudo user.

[WARNING]
====
Credentials which are used in _Scheduled Jobs_ must not be configured as *Prompt on launch*.
