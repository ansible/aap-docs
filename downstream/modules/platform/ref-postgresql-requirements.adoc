= PostgreSQL requirements

{PlatformName} uses PostgreSQL 15. PostgreSQL user passwords are hashed with SCRAM-SHA-256 secure hashing algorithm before storing in the database.

To determine if your {ControllerName} instance has access to the database, you can do so with the command, `awx-manage check_db` command.

// [ddacosta - removed based on AAP-15617]| *Each {ControllerName}* | 40 GB dedicated hard disk space |

//* Dedicate a minimum of 20 GB to `/var/` for file and working directory storage.
//* Storage volume must be rated for a minimum baseline of 1500 IOPS.
//* Projects are stored on control and hybrid nodes, and for the duration of jobs, are also stored on execution nodes. If the cluster has many large projects, consider having twice the GB in /var/lib/awx/projects, to avoid disk space errors.

//* 150 GB+ recommended
// | *Each {HubName}* | 60 GB dedicated hard disk space |

//Storage volume must be rated for a minimum baseline of 1500 IOPS.

[NOTE]
====
* {ControllerNameStart} data is stored in the database.
Database storage increases with the number of hosts managed, number of jobs run, number of facts stored in the fact cache, and number of tasks in any individual job. 
For example, a playbook runs every hour (24 times a day) across 250 hosts, with 20 tasks, stores over 800000 events in the database every week.

* If not enough space is reserved in the database, the old job runs and facts must be cleaned on a regular basis. For more information, see link:{URLControllerAdminGuide}/assembly-controller-management-jobs[Management Jobs] in the _{TitleControllerAdminGuide}_.

.PostgreSQL Configurations

Optionally, you can configure the PostgreSQL database as separate nodes that are not managed by the {PlatformName} installer.
When the {PlatformNameShort} installer manages the database server, it configures the server with defaults that are generally recommended for most workloads.
For more information about the settings you can use to improve database performance, see link:https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/administration/performance.html#database-settings[Database Settings].
