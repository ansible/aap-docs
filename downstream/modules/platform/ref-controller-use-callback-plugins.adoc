= Use callback plugins with {ControllerName}

Ansible has a flexible method of handling actions during playbook runs, called callback plugins. 
You can use these plugins with {ControllerName} to do things such as notify services upon playbook runs or failures, or send
emails after every playbook run. 

For official documentation on the callback plugin architecture, see link:http://docs.ansible.com/developing_plugins.html#callbacks[Developing plugins].

[NOTE]
====
{ControllerNameStart} does not support the `stdout` callback plugin because Ansible only permits one, and it is already being used for streaming event data.
====

You might also want to review some example plugins, which should be modified for site-specific purposes, such as those available at: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/lib/ansible/plugins/callback

To use these plugins, put the callback plugin `.py` file into a directory called `/callback_plugins` alongside your playbook in your {ControllerName} Project. 
Then, specify their paths (one path per line) in the *Ansible Callback Plugins* field of the Job settings:

[NOTE]
====
To have most callbacks shipped with Ansible applied globally, you must add them to the `callback_whitelist` section of your `ansible.cfg`. 

//Is it still called whitelist? Apparently so.

If you have custom callbacks, see link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/callback.html#enabling-callback-plugins[Enabling callback plugins].
