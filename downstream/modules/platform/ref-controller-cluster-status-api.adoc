= Status and monitoring by browser API

{ControllerNameStart} reports as much status as it can using the browser API at `/api/v2/ping` to validate the health of the cluster.
This includes the following:

* The instance servicing the HTTP request
* The timestamps of the last heartbeat of all other instances in the cluster
* Instance Groups and Instance membership in those groups

View more details about Instances and Instance Groups, including running jobs and membership information at `/api/v2/instances/` and `/api/v2/instance_groups/`.
