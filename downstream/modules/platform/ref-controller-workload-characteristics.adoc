= Characteristics of your workload

Before planning your deployment, establish the workload that you want to support. Consider the following factors to characterize an {ControllerName} workload:

* Managed hosts
* Tasks per hour per host
* Maximum number of concurrent jobs that you want to support
* Maximum number of forks set on jobs. Forks determine the number of hosts that a job acts on concurrently.
* Maximum API requests per second
* Node size that you prefer to deploy (CPU/Memory/Disk)
