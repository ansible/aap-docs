= Configuring platform security

//Content divided into multiple procedures to address issue AAP-30592

From the *Platform gateway settings* page, you can configure platform security settings.

.Procedure
. From the navigation panel, select {MenuSetGateway}.
. The *Platform gateway settings* page is displayed. 
. To configure the options, click btn:[Edit].
. You can configure the following *Security* settings:
+
* *Allow admin to set insecure*: Whether a superuser account can save an insecure password when editing any local user account.
* *Gateway basic auth enabled*: Enable basic authentication to the platform gateway API.
+
Turning this off prevents all basic authentication (local users), so customers need to make sure they have their alternative authentication mechanisms correctly configured before doing so. 
+
Turning it off with only local authentication configured also prevents all access to the UI.
+
*Social auth username is full email*: Enabling this setting alerts social authentication to use the full email as username instead of the full name.
+
*Gateway token name*: The header name to push from the proxy to the backend service. 
+
[WARNING]
==== 
If this name is changed, backends must be updated to compensate.
====
+
* *Gateway access token expiration*: How long the access tokens are valid for.
* *Jwt private key*: The private key used to encrypt the JWT tokens sent to backend services. 
+
This should be a private RSA key and one should be generated automatically on installation.
+
[NOTE]
==== 
Use caution when rotating the key as it will cause current sessions to fail until their JWT keys are reset.
====
+
* (Read only) *Jwt public key*: The private key used to encrypt the JWT tokens sent to backend services. 
+
This should be a private RSA key and one should be generated automatically on installation. 
+
[NOTE]
==== 
See other services' documentation on how they consume this key.
