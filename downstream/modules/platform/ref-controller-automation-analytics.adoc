= Automation Analytics

When you imported your license for the first time, you were given options related to the collection of data that powers {Analytics}, a cloud service that is part of the {PlatformNameShort} subscription. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
For opt-in of {Analytics} to have any effect, your instance of {ControllerName} must be running on {RHEL}.
====

As with Red Hat Insights, {Analytics} is built to collect the minimum amount of data needed. 
No credential secrets, personal data, automation variables, or task output is gathered. 

For more information, see xref:ref-controller-data-collection-details[Details of data collection].

To enable this feature, turn on data collection for {Analytics} and enter your Red Hat customer credentials in the *Miscellaneous System settings* of the System configuration list of options in the *Settings* menu.

You can view the location to which the collection of insights data is uploaded in the *{Analytics} upload URL* field on the *Details* page.

By default, the data is collected every four hours. 
When you enable this feature, data is collected up to a month in arrears (or until the previous collection). 
You can turn off this data collection at any time in the *Miscellaneous System settings* of the System configuration
window.

This setting can also be enabled through the API by specifying `INSIGHTS_TRACKING_STATE = true` in either of these endpoints:

* `api/v2/settings/all`
* `api/v2/settings/system`

The {Analytics} generated from this data collection can be found on the link:https://cloud.redhat.com[Red Hat Cloud Services] portal.

*Clusters* data is the default view. 
This graph represents the number of job runs across all {ContrllerName} clusters over a period of time.
The example above shows a span of a week in a stacked bar-style chart that is organized by the number of jobs that ran successfully (in green) and jobs that failed (in red).

Alternatively, you can select a single cluster to view its job status information.

This multi-line chart represents the number of job runs for a single {ControllerName} cluster for a specified period of time.  
The preceding example shows a span of a week, organized by the number of successfully running jobs (in green) and jobs that failed (in red). 
You can specify the number of successful and failed job runs for a selected cluster over a span of one week, two weeks, and monthly increments.
