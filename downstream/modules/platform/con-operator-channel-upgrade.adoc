= Channel upgrades

Upgrading to version 2.5 from {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 involves retrieving updates from a “channel”.
A channel refers to a location where you can access your update.
It currently resides in the OpenShift console UI.

==  In-channel upgrades

Most upgrades occur within a channel as follows:

. A new update becomes available in the marketplace, through the redhat-operator CatalogSource.
. The system automatically creates a new InstallPlan for your {PlatformNameShort} subscription.
* If set to *Manual*, the InstallPlan needs manual approval in the OpenShift UI.
* If set to *Automatic*, it upgrades as soon as the new version is available.

[NOTE]
====
Set a manual install strategy on your {OperatorPlatformNameShort} subscription during installation or upgrade. You will be prompted to approve upgrades when available in your chosen update channel. Stable channels, like stable-2.5, are available for each X.Y release.

. A new subscription, CSV, and operator containers are created alongside the old ones.
The old resources are cleaned up after a successful install.

== Cross-channel upgrades

Upgrading between X.Y channels is always manual and intentional.
Stable channels for major and minor versions are in the Operator Catalog. 
Currently, only version 2.x is available, so there are few channels.
It is recommended to stay on the latest minor version channel for the latest patches.

If the subscription is set for manual upgrades, you must approve the upgrade in the UI. Then, the system upgrades the Operator to the latest version in that channel.

====

The containers provided in the latest channel are updated regularly for OS upgrades and critical fixes. This allows customers to receive critical patches and CVE fixes faster. Larger changes and new features are saved for minor and major releases.

For each major or minor version channel, there is a corresponding "cluster-scoped" channel available. Cluster-scoped channels deploy operators that can manage all namespaces, while non-cluster-scoped channels can only manage resources in their own namespace.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Cluster-scoped bundles are not compatible with namespace-scoped bundles. Do not try to switch between normal (stable-2.4 for example) channels and cluster-scoped (stable-2.4-cluster-scoped) channels, as this is not supported.
