= Configuring GitHub enterprise team authentication

To set up social authentication for a GitHub enterprise team, you must obtain a GitHub Enterprise Organization URL, an Organization API URL, an Organization OAuth2 key and secret for a web application.

To obtain the URLs, refer to the link:https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.1/rest/reference/enterprise-admin[GitHub Enterprise administration documentation].

To obtain the key and secret, you must first register your enterprise organization-owned application at `https://github.com/organizations/<yourorg>/settings/applications`.

The OAuth2 key (Client ID) and secret (Client Secret) are used to supply the required fields in the UI. To register the application, you must supply it with your webpage URL, which is the *Callback URL* shown in the Authenticator details for your authenticator configuration. See xref:gw-display-auth-details[Displaying authenticator details] for instructions on accessing this information.

Each key and secret must belong to a unique application and cannot be shared or reused between different authentication  backends.
The OAuth2key (Client ID) and secret (Client Secret) are used to supply the required fields in the UI.
