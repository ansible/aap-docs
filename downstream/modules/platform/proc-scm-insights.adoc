= SCM Type - Configuring playbooks to use {RHLightspeed}

Configure your projects to retrieve Ansible playbooks directly from {RHLightspeed}. 
By integrating with {RHLightspeed}, you can use it to manage and deploy remediation playbooks identified through its analysis of your {RHEL} environment. 
This integration streamlines the process of addressing identified vulnerabilities and optimizing system configurations, ensuring your automation aligns with best practices and security recommendations.

.Procedure

. From the navigation panel, select {MenuAEProjects}.
. Click the project name you want to use.
. In the project *Details* tab, click btn:[Edit project].
. Select *{RHLightspeed}* from the *Source Control Type* menu.
. In the *{RHLightspeed} credential* field, select the appropriate credential for use with {RHLightspeed}, as {RHLightspeed} requires a credential for authentication. 
. Optional: In the *Options* field, select the launch behavior, if applicable:

* *Clean* - Removes any local modifications before performing an update.
* *Delete* - Deletes the local repository in its entirety before performing an update. 
Depending on the size of the repository this can significantly increase the amount of time required to complete an
update.
* *Update revision on launch* - Updates the revision of the project to the current revision in the remote source control, and caches the
roles directory from xref:ref-projects-galaxy-support[{Galaxy} support] or xref:ref-projects-collections-support[Collections support]. 
{ControllerNameStart} ensures that the local revision matches, and that the roles and collections are up-to-date.
If jobs are spawned faster than the project can synchronize, selecting this enables you to configure a Cache Timeout to
cache previous project synchronizations for a certain number of seconds, to avoid job overflow.
