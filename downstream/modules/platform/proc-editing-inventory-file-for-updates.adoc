[id="editing-inventory-file-for-updates_{context}"]

= Set up the inventory file

[role="_abstract"]
Before upgrading your {PlatformName} installation, edit the `inventory` file so that it matches your required configuration.
You can keep the same parameters from your existing {PlatformNameShort} deployment or you can update the parameters to match any changes to your environment.

You can find sample inventory files in the link:https://github.com/ansible/test-topologies/[Test topologies] GitHub repository, or in our {LinkTopologies} guide.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the installation program directory.
Bundled installer::
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
-----
$ cd ansible-automation-platform-setup-bundle-2.6-4-x86_64
-----
+
Online installer::
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
-----
$ cd ansible-automation-platform-setup-2.6-4
-----

. Open the `inventory` file for editing.
. Modify the `inventory` file to provision new nodes, deprovision nodes or groups, and import or generate {HubName} API tokens.
+
You can use the same `inventory` file from an existing {PlatformNameShort} installation if there are no changes to the environment.
+
[NOTE]
====
Provide a reachable IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for all hosts to ensure that users can synchronize and install content from {HubNameMain} from a different node. 
Do not use `localhost`.
If `localhost` is used, the upgrade will be stopped as part of preflight checks.
====

. Provision new nodes in a cluster, by adding new nodes alongside existing nodes in the `inventory` file as follows:
+
[source,ini,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::ini/clustered-nodes.ini[]
