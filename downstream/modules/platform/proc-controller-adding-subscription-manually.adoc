= Add a subscription manually

If you are unable to apply or update the subscription information by using the {ControllerName} user interface, you can upload the subscriptions manifest manually in an Ansible playbook.

Use the license module in the `ansible.controller` collection:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
- name: Set the license using a file
  license:
  manifest: "/tmp/my_manifest.zip"
----
