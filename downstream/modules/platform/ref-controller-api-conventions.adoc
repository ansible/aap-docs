[id="controller-api-conventions-in-API"]

The API is versioned for compatibility reasons. 
You can see what API versions are available by querying `/api/`.

You might have to specify the content or type on `POST` or `PUT` requests:

* `PUT`: Update a specific resource (by an identifier) or a collection of resources. 
You can also use `PUT` to create a specific resource if you know the resource identifier before-hand.
* `POST`: Create a new resource. 
Also acts as a catch-all verb for operations that do not fit into the other categories.

All URIs not ending with "/" receive a 301 redirect.

[NOTE]
====
The formatting of `extra_vars` attached to Job Template records is preserved. 
YAML is returned as YAML with formatting and comments preserved, and JSON is returned as JSON.
