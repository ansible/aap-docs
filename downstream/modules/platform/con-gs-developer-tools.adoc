= Ansible developer tools

Ansible development tools are an integrated and supported suite of capabilities that help IT practitioners at any skill level accurately create automation content faster than with manual coding. 
This includes building, testing, and deploying modules and playbooks without requiring hard coding skills.

These tools include:

* Ansible Molecule - creates test environments that mimic real ones, allowing you to test playbooks, roles, and collections across many instances, operating systems, virtualization providers, and more.
* Ansible Lint - analyzes your playbooks, roles, and collectionsâ€”looking at the markup syntax and how you are using the modules. 
It goes beyond regular YAML linters by checking Ansible tasks themselves. 
* Execution environment builder - removes the risk of dependency issues when creating automation content by installing your collections and all of their dependencies in a containerized image (known as an {ExecEnvShort}).
* Content testing suite - run checks to enforce coding standards and requirements, unit tests against Ansible modules, and integration tests to ensure workflows connect to your source code repositories.
* Automation content navigator - reviews and explores collections, configurations, documentation, images, inventories, and playbooks. 
Complete tasks such as watching jobs, sharing playbooks, browsing {ExecEnvShort} and inventories, and extracting reusable examples.
* Ansible content development kit - is a bundled collection of tools that expands Ansible content creation from IT practitioners performing manual tasks to self-enabled automation content developers.
