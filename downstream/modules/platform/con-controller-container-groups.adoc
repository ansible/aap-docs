= Container groups

{PlatformNameShort} supports container groups, which enable you to execute jobs in {ControllerName} regardless of whether {ControllerName} is installed as a standalone, in a virtual environment, or in a container. 
Container groups act as a pool of resources within a virtual environment. 
You can create instance groups to point to an OpenShift container, which are job environments that are provisioned on-demand as a pod that exists only for the duration of the playbook run. 
This is known as the ephemeral execution model and ensures a clean environment for every job run.

In some cases, you might want to set container groups to be "always-on", which you can configure through the creation of an instance.

[NOTE]
====
Container groups upgraded from versions prior to {ControllerName} 4.0 revert back to default and remove the old pod definition, clearing out all custom pod definitions in the migration.
====

Container groups are different from {ExecEnvShort}s in that {ExecEnvShort}s are container images and do not use a virtual environment.
