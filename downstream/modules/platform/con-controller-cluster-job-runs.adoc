= Job runs

By default, when a job is submitted to the {ControllerName} queue, it can be picked up by any of the workers. 
However, you can control where a particular job runs, such as restricting the instances from which a job runs on.

To support taking an instance offline temporarily, there is a property enabled defined on each instance. 
When this property is disabled, no jobs are assigned to that instance. 
Existing jobs finish, but no new work is assigned.
