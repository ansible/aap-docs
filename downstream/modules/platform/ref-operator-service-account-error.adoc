= Operator service account error

[role="_abstract"]

Manually modifying the `aap_operator_service_account` user in the {PlatformNameShort} database or UI removes the required `is_superuser` flag. 
This action causes a critical failure in the {gateway} operator's reconciliation loop.

You see the following error:

----
TASK [ansibleautomationplatform : Create operator service account user] â€¦ CommandError: Error: That username is already taken
----

The {PlatformNameShort} operator automatically recreates the service account when the account is missing. 
To restore the required superuser privileges, you must remove the existing, incorrectly configured user.

After you delete the user, the {Gateway} operator automatically runs its idempotency logic, recreates the account, and ensures it has the necessary `is_superuser=True` flag, restoring the reconciliation loop's functionality.
