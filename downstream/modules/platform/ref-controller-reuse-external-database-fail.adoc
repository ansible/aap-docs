= Prevent installation failures when reusing an external database

[role="_abstract"]
When reusing an external database for clustered installations, you must manually clear the database before performing subsequent installations.

Instances have been reported where reusing the external database during subsequent installation of nodes causes installation failures.

*Example*

You perform a clustered installation. 
Then, you need to do this again and perform a second clustered installation reusing the same external database, only this subsequent installation failed.

When setting up an external database that has been used in a prior installation, you must manually clear the database used for the clustered node before any additional installations can succeed.
