= Adding an {ExecEnvShort} to a job template

.Prerequisites

* An {ExecEnvShort} must have been created using ansible-builder as described in [ADD 2.5 LINK]:Build an execution environment. 
When an {ExecEnvShort} has been created, you can use it to run jobs. 
Use the {ControllerName} UI to specify the execution environment to use in your job templates.
* Depending on whether an {ExecEnvShort} is made available for global use or tied to an organization, you must have the appropriate level of administrator privileges to use an {ExecEnvShort} in a job. 
Execution environments tied to an organization require Organization administrators to be able to run jobs with those {ExecEnvShort}.
* Before running a job or job template that uses an {ExecEnvShort} that has a credential assigned to it, ensure that the credential has a username, host, and password.

== About container registries

If you have many {ExecEnvShort} that you want to maintain, you can store them in a container registry linked to your {PrivateHubName}. 

For more information, see [ADD 2.5 LINK]:Populating your private automation hub container registry from the Creating and consuming execution environments guide.
