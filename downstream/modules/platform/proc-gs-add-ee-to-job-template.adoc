= Adding an {ExecEnvShort} to a job template

.Prerequisites

* An {ExecEnvShort} must have been created using ansible-builder as described in link:{URLBuilder}/assembly-using-builder[Using {Builder}]. 
When an {ExecEnvShort} has been created, you can use it to run jobs. 
Use the {ControllerName} UI to specify the execution environment to use in your job templates.
* Depending on whether an {ExecEnvShort} is made available for global use or tied to an organization, you must have the appropriate level of administrator privileges to use an {ExecEnvShort} in a job. 
Execution environments tied to an organization require Organization administrators to be able to run jobs with those {ExecEnvShort}.
* Before running a job or job template that uses an {ExecEnvShort} that has a credential assigned to it, ensure that the credential has a username, host, and password.

.Procedure

. From the navigation panel, select {MenuInfrastructureExecEnvironments}.
. Click btn:[Create execution environment] to create an {ExecEnvShort}.
. Enter the appropriate details into the following fields: 
.. *Name* (required): Enter a name for the {ExecEnvShort}.
.. *Image* (required): Enter the image name. The image name requires its full location (repository), the registry, image name, and version tag, as in the following example: `quay.io/ansible/awx-ee:latestrepo/project/image-name:tag`
.. Optional: *Pull*: Choose the type of pull when running jobs: 
... *Always pull container before running*: Pulls the latest image file for the container.
... *Only pull the image if not present before running*: Only pulls the latest image if none are specified.
... *Never pull container before running*: Never pull the latest version of the container image.
+
NOTE: If you do not set a type for pull, the value defaults to *Only pull the image if not present before running*.
+
.. Optional: *Description*: Enter an optional description.
.. Optional: *Organization*: Assign the organization to specifically use this {ExecEnvShort}. To make the {ExecEnvShort} available for use across multiple organizations, leave this field blank.
.. *Registry credential*: If the image has a protected container registry, provide the credential to access it.
. Click btn:[Create {ExecEnvShort}]. Your newly added {ExecEnvShort} is ready to be used in a job template.
. To add an {ExecEnvShort} to a job template, navigate to {MenuAETemplates} and select your template.
..Click btn:[Edit template] and specify your {ExecEnvShort} in the field labeled *{ExecEnvShort}*.

When you have added an {ExecEnvShort} to a job template, the template will be listed in the *Templates* tab in your {ExecEnvShort} details.

== About container registries

If you have many {ExecEnvShort} that you want to maintain, you can store them in a container registry linked to your {PrivateHubName}. 

For more information, see link:{URLBuilder}/populate-container-registry[Populating your private automation hub container registry] from the {TitleBuilder} guide.
