= Backing up container-based {PlatformNameShort}

Perform a backup of your {ContainerBase} of {PlatformNameShort}.

.Procedure

. Go to the {PlatformName} installation directory on your {RHEL} host.

. Run the `backup` playbook:
+
----
$ ansible-playbook -i <path_to_inventory> ansible.containerized_installer.backup
----

This backs up the important data deployed by the containerized installer such as:

* PostgreSQL databases
* Configuration files
* Data files

By default, the backup directory is set to `~/backups`. You can change this by using the `backup_dir` variable in your `inventory` file.
