= Filtering reports by organization

To filter your report so that only certain organizations are present, use this environment variable with a semicolon separated list of organization names.

`export METRICS_UTILITY_ORGANIZATION_FILTER="ACME;Organization 1"`

This renders only the data from these organizations in the built report. This filter currently does not have any effect on the following optional sheets: 

* `usage_by_collections` 
* `usage_by_roles`
* `usage_by_modules`
