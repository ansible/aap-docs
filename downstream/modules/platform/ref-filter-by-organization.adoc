= Filtering reports by organization

[role="_abstract"]
When generating reports by using the metrics utility, you can filter the data by organization.

To filter your report so that only certain organizations are present, use this environment variable with a semicolon separated list of organization names.

`export METRICS_UTILITY_ORGANIZATION_FILTER="Organization 1;Organization 2"`

This renders only the data from these organizations in the built report. This filter currently does not have any effect on the following optional sheets: 

* `usage_by_collections` 
* `usage_by_roles`
* `usage_by_modules`
