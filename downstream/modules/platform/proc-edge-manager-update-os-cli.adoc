= Update the operating system on the CLI

[role="_abstract"]

You can update the operating system on an individual device by specifying a new target image in the device manifest using the {RedHatEdge} CLI. 
This initiates a secure, transactional update process managed automatically by the device agent.

.Procedure

. Get the current resource manifest of the device by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
flightctl get device/<device_name> -o yaml > my_device.yaml
----

. Edit the `Device` resource to specify the new operating system name and version target.

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: flightctl.io/v1alpha1
kind: Device
metadata:
  name: <device_name>
spec:
[...]
  os:
    image: quay.io/flightctl/rhel:9.5
[...]
----

. Apply the updated `Device` resource by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
flightctl apply -f <device_name>.yaml
----
