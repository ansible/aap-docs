= Deprovisioning isolated nodes

[role="_abstract"]
You have the option to manually remove any isolated nodes using the `awx-manage` deprovisioning utility.

[WARNING]
====
Use the deprovisioning command to remove only isolated nodes that have not migrated to execution nodes. To deprovision execution nodes from your {AutomationMesh} architecture, use the xref:proc-deprovisioning-nodes[Deprovisioning individual nodes using the installer] method instead.
====
