[id="proc-deprovision-isolated-nodes"]

= Deprovisioning isolated nodes
You have the option to manually remove any isolated nodes using the `awx-manage` deprovisioning utility.

[WARNING]
====
Use the deprovisioning command to remove only isolated nodes that have not migrated to execution nodes. To deprovision execution nodes from your {AutomationMesh} architecture, use the xref:proc-deprovisioning-nodes[Deprovisioning individual nodes using the installer] method instead.

.Procedure

. Shut down the instance:
+
----
$ automation-controller-service stop
----
. Run the deprovision command from another instance, replacing `__host_name__` with the name of the node as listed in the inventory file:
[subs="+quotes"]
+
----
$ awx-manage deprovision_instance --hostname=__<host_name>__
----
