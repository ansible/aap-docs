= Choosing and obtaining a {PlatformName} installer

[role="_abstract"]
Choose the {PlatformName} installer you need based on your {RHEL} environment internet connectivity. Review the following scenarios and determine which {PlatformName} installer meets your needs.

[NOTE]
====
A valid Red Hat customer account is required to access {PlatformName} installer downloads on the Red Hat Customer Portal.

.Installing with internet access

Choose the {PlatformName} installer if your {RHEL} environment is connected to the internet. Installing with internet access retrieves the latest required repositories, packages, and dependencies. Choose one of the following ways to set up your {PlatformNameShort} installer.

*Tarball install*

. Navigate to https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/480
. Click btn:[Download Now] for the *Ansible Automation Platform <latest-version> Setup*.
. Extract the files:
+
-----
$ tar xvzf ansible-automation-platform-setup-<latest-version>.tar.gz
-----

*RPM install*

. Install the {PlatformNameShort} Installer Package
+
v.2.2 for RHEL 8 for x86_64
+
----
$ sudo dnf install --enablerepo=ansible-automation-platform-2.2-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms ansible-automation-platform-installer
----
+
v.2.2 for RHEL 9 for x86-64
+
----
$ sudo dnf install --enablerepo=ansible-automation-platform-2.2-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms ansible-automation-platform-installer
----

[NOTE]
`dnf install` enables the repo as the repo is disabled by default.

When you use the RPM installer, the files are placed under the `/opt/ansible-automation-platform/installer` directory. 

.Installing without internet access

Use the {PlatformName} *Bundle* installer if you are unable to access the internet, or would prefer not to install separate components and dependencies from online repositories. Access to {RHEL} repositories is still needed. All other dependencies are included in the tar archive.

. Navigate to https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/480
. Click btn:[Download Now] for the *Ansible Automation Platform <latest-version> Setup Bundle*.
. Extract the files:
+
-----
$ tar xvzf ansible-automation-platform-setup-bundle-<latest-version>.tar.gz
