= Preventing LDAP attributes from updating on each login

By default, when an LDAP user authenticates, all user-related attributes are updated in the database on each login. 
In some environments, you can skip this operation due to performance issues. 
To avoid it, you can disable the option *AUTH_LDAP_ALWAYS_UPDATE_USER*.

[WARNING]
====
Set this option to `false` to not update the LDAP user's attributes. 
Attributes are only updated the first time the user is created.
====

.Procedure

. Create a custom file under `/etc/tower/conf.d/custom-ldap.py` with the following contents. 
If you have multiple nodes, execute it on all nodes:
+
[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
AUTH_LDAP_ALWAYS_UPDATE_USER = False
----
+
. Restart {ControllerName} on all nodes:
+
[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
automation-controller-service restart
----
+
With this option set to `False`, no changes to LDAP user's attributes are pushed to {ControllerName}. 
Note that new users are created and their attributes are pushed to the database on their first login.

By default, an LDAP user gets their attributes updated in the database upon each login. 
For a playbook that runs multiple times with an LDAP credential, those queries can be avoided.

.Verification

Check the PostgreSQL for slow queries related to the LDAP authentication.
