= Troubleshooting containerized {PlatformNameShort} configuration

// New items have appeared within installation program directory once an install has been run. What are these items?

.Sometimes the post install for seeding my {PlatformNameShort} content errors out. This could manifest itself as output similar to this:

The `infra.controller_configuration.dispatch` role uses an asynchronous loop with 30 retries to apply each configuration type, and the default delay between retries is 1 second. If the configuration is large, this might not be enough time to apply everything before the last retry occurs. 

Increase the retry delay by setting the `controller_configuration_async_delay` variable to something other than 1 second. For example, setting it to 2 seconds doubles the retry time. The place to do this would be in the repository where the controller configuration is defined. It could also be added to the `[all:vars]` section of the installation program inventory file.

A few instances have shown that no additional modification is required, and re-running the installation program again worked.

//I have updated a configuration file, how do I get changes to apply?
//<describe how to restart service for each component>
