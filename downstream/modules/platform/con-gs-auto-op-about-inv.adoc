= About inventories

An inventory is a file listing the collection of hosts managed by {PlatformNameShort}. 
Organizations are assigned to inventories, while permissions to launch playbooks against inventories are controlled at the user or team level.

Platform administrators and automation developers have the permissions to create inventories. 
As an automation operator you can view inventories and their details.
