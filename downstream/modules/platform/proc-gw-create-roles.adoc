= Creating a role

{PlatformNameShort} services provide a set of predefined roles with permissions sufficient for standard automation tasks. It is also possible to configure custom roles that define access permissions to a resource.

If the default predefined roles for a resource type do not include all the permissions you need to grant access to a team or user, you can create custom roles for your organization. 
Customizing roles reduces complexity by allowing you to create one role per resource type for an organization or a specific resource, rather than assigning a team or user multiple roles to cover all needed access.

.Procedure

. From the navigation panel, select {MenuAMRoles}.
. Click btn:[Create role].
. Provide a *Name* and a short *Description* for the role. The name and description should be unique and specific to the role's intended use and permissions to give context when assigning the role.
. Select a *Resource Type*. Ensure that you are selecting the desired resource in the correct component context, because resources like projects and credentials can be associated with both Automation Execution and Automation Decisions.
. Select the *Permissions* you want assigned to this role from the drop-down menu.
. Click btn:[Create role] to create your new role.
