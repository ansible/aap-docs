= Using the base {ExecEnvNameSing}

Your subscription with {PlatformNameShort} gives you access to some base {ExecEnvName}. You can use a base {ExecEnvShort} as a starting point for creating a customized {ExecEnvShort}.

{PlatformNameShort} includes the following default execution environments:

* `Minimal` - Includes the latest Ansible-core 2.15 release along with Ansible Runner, but does not include collections or other content
* `EE Supported` - Minimal, plus all Red Hat-supported collections and dependencies

Base images included with {PlatformNameShort} are hosted on the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog (registry.redhat.io).

.Prerequisites 

* You have a valid {PlatformName} subscription. 

.Procedure 

. Log in to registry.redhat.io.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ podman login registry.redhat.io
----
+
. Pull the base images from the registry: 
[source,bash]

While these environments cover many automation use cases, you can also customize these containers for your specific needs. For more information about customizing your execution environment, see link:{URLBuilder}/assembly-publishing-exec-env#proc-customize-ee-image[Customizing an existing automation {ExecEnvShort} image] in the {TitleBuilder} guide.
