= Using the base automation {ExecEnvShort}

Your subscription with Ansible Automation Platform gives you access to some base automation execution environments. You can use a base automation execution environment as a starting point for creating a customized automation execution environment.

== Customize the base execution environment image

{PlatformNameShort} includes the following default execution environments:

* `Minimal` - Includes the latest Ansible-core 2.15 release along with Ansible Runner, but does not include collections or other content
* `EE Supported` - Minimal, plus all Red Hat-supported collections and dependencies

While these environments cover many automation use cases, you can add additional items to customize these containers for your specific needs. For more information about customizing your execution environment, see Customizing an existing automation {ExecEnvShort} image in the Creating and consuming execution environments guide. 

== About Ansible Builder

You also have the option of creating an entirely new {ExecEnvShort} with Ansible Builder. 
Ansible Builder is a command line tool you can use to create an e{ExecEnvShort} for Ansible. 
You must create {ExecEnvShort} with Ansible Builder. 

To build your own execution environment, you must: 

* Download Ansible Builder

* Create an execution environment image based on the definition file
