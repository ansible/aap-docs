= Enroll devices

To manage your devices with the {RedHatEdge}, you must enroll the devices to the {RedHatEdge} service.

The first time the {RedHatEdge} agents runs on a device, the agent prepares for the enrollment process by generating a cryptographic key pair.
The cryptographic key pair serves as the unique cryptographic identity of the device.
The key pair consists of a public and a private key.
The private key never leaves the device, so that the device cannot be duplicated or impersonated.

When the device is not yet enrolled, the agent performs service discovery to find its {RedHatEdge} service instance.
Then, the device establishes a secure, mTLS-protected network connection to the service.
The device uses its X.509 enrollment certificate that the device acquired during image building or device provisioning.
The device submits an enrollment request to the service that includes the following:

* a description of the device hardware and operating system
* an X.509 Certificate Signing Request which includes the cryptographic identity of the device to obtain the initial management certificate

The device is not considered trusted and remains quarantined in a device lobby until an authorized user approves or denies the request.
