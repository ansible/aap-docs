= Content needed for an {ExecEnvShort}

[role="_abstract"]
Ansible-builder is used to create an {ExecEnvShort}.

An {ExecEnvShort} must contain:

* Ansible
* {Runner}
* Ansible Collections
* Python and system dependencies of:
** modules or plugins in collections
** content in ansible-base
** custom user needs

Building a new {ExecEnvShort} involves a definition that specifies which content you want to include in your {ExecEnvShort}, such as collections, Python requirements, and system-level packages. 
The definition must be a .yml file

The content from the output generated from migrating to {ExecEnvShort}s has some of the required data that can be piped to a file or pasted into this definition file.
