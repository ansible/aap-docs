= Edit Job Templates

System administrators, organization administrators, and project administrators, within a project under their administrative capabilities, can create and modify new job templates for that project.

When editing a job template, administrators ({ControllerName}, organization, and project) can select inventory and credentials in the organization for which they have usage capabilities, or they can leave those fields blank so that they are selected at runtime.

Additionally, they can specify one or more users or teams (from those that are members of that project) that have execution capabilities for that
job template. 
The execution capability is valid regardless of any explicit capabilities the user or team have been granted against the inventory or credential specified in the job template.
