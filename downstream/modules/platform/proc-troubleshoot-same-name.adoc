= {ControllerNameStart} custom resource has the same name as an existing deployment

[role=_abstract]

The name specified for the new `AutomationController` custom resource must not match an existing deployment or the recovery process will fail.

Persistent volume claims (PVCs) and Secrets remain after a deployment is deleted. 
If you want to reuse the same name you must delete previous PVCs and Secrets before creating a new custom resource.


If your AutomationController customer resource matches an existing deployment, perform the following steps to resolve the issue.

.Procedure
. Delete the existing AutomationController and the associated postgres PVC:
+
-----
oc delete automationcontroller <YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME> -n <YOUR_NAMESPACE>

oc delete pvc postgres-13-<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME>-13-0 -n <YOUR_NAMESPACE>
-----
+
. Use AutomationControllerRestore with the same deployment_name in it:
+
-----
oc apply -f restore.yaml
-----
