= Understand static provisioning in the {OperatorPlatformNameShort}

[role="_abstract"]
By default, the {OperatorPlatformNameShort} uses dynamic provisioning to create the required storage for components such as the database and {HubName}. 

If your environment does not allow dynamic provisioning, you must use static provisioning.

With static provisioning, you manually create Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) before you deploy the `AnsibleAutomationPlatform` custom resource. 
When the Operator starts the deployment, it searches the namespace for PVCs that match its internal naming conventions. 
If a matching PVC exists, the Operator binds to that claim instead of attempting to provision new storage.

Static provisioning also enables data persistence during redeployments.
If you delete an `AnsibleAutomationPlatform` instance, the Operator does not delete the associated PVCs.
You can redeploy the instance using the same name to reconnect to the existing data.
