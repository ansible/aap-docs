= Operating system images with scripts

[role="_abstract"]

Avoid executing scripts or commands that change the file system.
The `bootc` or the {RedHatEdge} can overwrite the changed files that can cause a deviation or failed integrity checks.

Instead, run such scripts or commands during image building so changes are part of the image.
You can also use the configuration management mechanisms of the {RedHatEdge}.
