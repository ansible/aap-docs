To add an administrator to an organization, the user must already exist.

. Click the *Administrators* tab.
. Click btn:[Add administrators].
. Select the users from the list by clicking the checkbox next to the name to assign the administrator role to them for this organization.
. Click btn:[Add administrators].
. To remove a particular administrator from the organization, select *Remove administrator* from the *More actions {MoreActionsIcon}* list next to the administrator name. This launches a confirmation dialog, asking you to confirm the removal.
