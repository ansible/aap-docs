= Choose an installation type

[role="_abstract"]
Containerized {PlatformNameShort} supports two installation types: online and disconnected. Review the requirements for each to decide which is appropriate for your environment.

== Online installation

An online installation pulls container images directly from Red Hat registries during the installation process.

*Requirements:*

* An active internet connection on all {PlatformNameShort} nodes
* A Red Hat registry service account with credentials (`registry_username` and `registry_password`)
* Network access to Red Hat registries (registry.redhat.io)

For online installation instructions, see link:{URLContainerizedInstall}/preparing-containerized-installation[Preparing the containerized {PlatformNameShort} installation].

== Disconnected (bundled) installation

A disconnected installation uses a pre-packaged bundle that includes all container images and dependencies. This installation type is designed for air-gapped or restricted network environments.

*Requirements:*

* Local RPM repository configured with required dependencies
* No internet connection required during installation
* Red Hat registry credentials are not required

For disconnected installation instructions, see link:{URLContainerizedInstall}/aap-containerized-disconnected-installation[Disconnected installation].
