= Backwards-Compatible API Considerations

Support for version 2 of the API (`api/v2/`) means a one-to-many relationship for Job Templates to credentials (including multi-cloud
support). 

Credentials can be filtered using the v2 API:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
$ curl "https://controller.example.org/api/v2/credentials/?credential_type__namespace=aws"
----

In the V2 Credential Type model, the relationships are defined as follows:

[cols="15%,40%",options="header"]
|===
| Machine | SSH
| Vault | Vault
| Network |Sets environment variables, for example `ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE`
| SCM | Source Control
| Cloud | EC2, AWS
| Cloud | Lots of others
| Insights |Insights
| Galaxy | galaxy.ansible.com, console.redhat.com
| Galaxy | on-premise {HubName}
