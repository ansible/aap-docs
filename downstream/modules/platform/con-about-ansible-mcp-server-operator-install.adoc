= Overview

[role="_abstract"]

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI models to use external AI tools and services via a unified interface. Using the Ansible MCP server, you can connect your {PlatformNameShort} with your preferred external AI tool (such as Claude, Cursor, or ChatGPT). The AI tools can access key information about your {PlatformNameShort} environment and perform tasks. Ansible users can query information, execute workflows, and perform automation tasks using natural language prompts directly within their preferred AI tool.

== Benefits

The following are the benefits of the Ansible MCP server:

*For external AI tools*:

* Provides a standardized interface for securely querying infrastructure data and executing automation workflows within the {PlatformNameShort}.
* Enables agentic workflows to interact with the {PlatformNameShort}.

*For Ansible users*: 

* Provides the ability to use the chatbot interface of their preferred external AI tool to get information about their {PlatformNameShort} environment, and run automation jobs directly through that tool.

*For developers*:

* Reduces the time and complexity of developing or integrating the {PlatformNameShort} with AI applications or agents.
* Simplifies AI integration, enabling existing automation through {PlatformNameShort} to be exposed to AI tools without writing custom API code or middleware.

== Workflow

The standalone Ansible MCP server functions as a secure link between your external AI clients and the {PlatformNameShort}. The AI agent accesses underlying infrastructure only when the Ansible MCP server has appropriate permissions.

The following describes the workflow:

. AI client (The requester): The user initiates a request through their external AI agent (for example, Cursor or Claude) using natural-language prompts.
. The AI model (The translator): The AI agent receives the request, interprets the intent, and maps it to the appropriate exposed Ansible toolset. It then sends a structured toolset call with the necessary parameters.
. Ansible MCP server (The gatekeeper): Upon receiving the call, the Ansible MCP server validates the request. It uses the user's API token to authenticate with the {ControllerName}.
. Ansible controller (The executor): The {ControllerName} accepts the validated command from the MCP server and triggers the appropriate automation job.
. Response loop: The automation result is returned to the Ansible MCP server, standardized into a format the AI agent can process, and displayed to the user via the AI client.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Both the Ansible MCP server and the {PlatformNameShort} UI access the {PlatformNameShort} API. However, because the AI tool processes the API output before displaying it in its chat interface, you might observe different results when comparing the output from the AI tool with the {PlatformNameShort} UI.

== Ansible MCP server toolsets

The Ansible MCP server provides a pre-configured suite of toolsets that effectively act as a bridge between your preferred AI agent and the {PlatformNameShort}. Once configured, these toolsets enable your AI agent to perform specific, authorized actions without requiring you to leave the chat interface.

The Ansible MCP server turns your AI agent from a passive assistant into an active operator that can interact with your {PlatformNameShort} infrastructure and execute workflows or automate tasks based on the permissions you define.

The following toolsets are available in this Technology Preview release:

== Server-level and user-level permissions

The Ansible MCP server employs a dual-layer security model to ensure safe integration between AI tools and your {PlatformNameShort} infrastructure. This approach combines a global administrative safeguard with the granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) of the {PlatformNameShort}.

You can grant the following access types to the Ansible MCP server:

* *Server-level permissions*: Organization administrators assign a global-level permission while deploying the Ansible MCP server. Administrators can choose one of the following access levels:

** Read-only access: The default setting that enforces a strict "look but do not touch" policy. The AI agent can retrieve system data, such as logs and inventory, but the agent cannot launch jobs or modify configurations. This global safeguard overrides all individual user permissions to prevent unintended automation.
** Read-write access: This setting authorizes the AI agent to make changes in your {PlatformNameShort}, such as executing job templates, managing resources, and applying infrastructure changes. However, these actions are subject to the specific RBAC permissions of the user-provided API token.

* *User-level permissions*: The AI agent's specific capabilities are inherited from the user account that generated the authentication API token.

** Inherited permissions: The AI tool inherits the user's permissions and performs only the actions the user is authorized to perform. For example, if the user's token only has permissions to view the "network" inventory, the AI tool cannot access or modify the "database" inventory even if the user requests it.
** Rejection of unauthorized actions: If the AI tool attempts an action (like launching a job) that the user's token is not authorized to perform, the {PlatformNameShort} API rejects the request.

[WARNING]
====
Enabling read-write access for the Ansible MCP server grants the AI agent autonomy to directly make changes in your {PlatformNameShort} environment, for example, executing automation jobs. The AI agent can directly make changes in your {PlatformNameShort} environment only if the user has write permissions. Large Language Models (LLMs) can occasionally misinterpret prompts or hallucinate commands. Therefore, enabling read-write access may introduce a risk of unintended changes to your environment.

== Telemetry data collection for Ansible MCP server
Red Hat collects anonymized telemetry data from the Ansible MCP server. The telemetry data includes metrics related to MCP server performance, adoption trends, and usage patterns. 

Telemetry data will be automatically collected for Ansible MCP server deployments using {PlatformNameShort} patch release on 21 January 2026 and later versions. Red Hat will use this data to monitor the operational health of your MCP servers and to ensure the long-term scalability of the MCP ecosystem.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Telemetry data collection cannot be disabled, but strict user privacy is maintained. Red Hat does not collect users' personal information, such as usernames or passwords. If any personal information is inadvertently received, the data is deleted. Refer to the link:https://www.redhat.com/en/about/privacy-policy[Red Hat Privacy Statement] for more information about Red Hat's privacy practices.
