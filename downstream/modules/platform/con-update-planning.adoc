= Update planning

Before you begin the update process, review the following considerations to plan and prepare your {PlatformNameShort} deployment:

* Even if you have a valid license from an earlier version, you must give your credentials or a subscription manifest upon upgrading to the latest version of {PlatformNameShort}. For more information, see link:{URLContainerizedInstall}/assembly-gateway-licensing#proc-attaching-subscriptions[Attaching your {PlatformName} subscription] in _{TitleContainerizedInstall}_.

* Clustered upgrades require special attention to instance and instance groups before upgrading. Ensure you capture your inventory or instance group details before upgrading. For more information, see link:{URLControllerAdminGuide}/controller-clustering[Clustering] in _{TitleControllerAdminGuide}_. 

* If you are currently running {EDAcontroller}, disable all rulebook activations before upgrading to ensure that only new activations run after the upgrade process has completed. This prevents possibilities of orphaned containers running activations from the earlier version. For more information, see link:{URLEDAUserGuide}/eda-rulebook-activations#eda-enable-rulebook-activations[Enabling and disabling rulebook activations] in _{TitleEDAUserGuide}_.
