= Limit in device selection

Each batch in the `BatchSequence` strategy might use an optional `limit` parameter to define how many devices should be included in the batch. 
You can specify the limit can in two ways:

* *Absolute number*: A fixed number of devices to be selected.
* *Percentage*: The percentage of the total matching device population to be selected.

** If you provide a `selector` with labels, the percentage is calculated based on the number of devices that match the label criteria within the fleet.
** If you do not provide a `selector`, the percentage is applied to all devices in the fleet.
