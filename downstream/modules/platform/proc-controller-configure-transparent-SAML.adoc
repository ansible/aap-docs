= Configuring transparent SAML logins

For transparent logins to work, you must first get IdP-initiated logins to work.

.Procedure

. Set the `RelayState` on the IdP to the key of the IdP definition in the *SAML Enabled Identity Providers* field. 
. When this is working, specify the redirect URL for non-logged-in users to somewhere other than the default {ControllerName} login page by using the *Login redirect override URL* field in the *Miscellaneous Authentication* settings window of the *Settings* menu. 
You must set this to `/sso/login/saml/?idp=<name-of-your-idp>` for transparent SAML login, as shown in the following example:

[NOTE]
====
This example shows a typical IdP format, but might not be the correct format for your particular case. 
You might need to reach out to your IdP for the correct transparent redirect URL as that URL is not the same for all IdPs.

. After you configure transparent SAML login, to log in using local credentials or a different SSO, go directly to `https://<your-tower-server>/login`. 
This provides the standard {ControllerName} login page, including SSO authentication options, enabling you to log in with any configured method.
