= Isolation functionality and variables

{ControllerNameStart} uses container technology to isolate jobs from each other. 
By default, only the current project is exposed to the container running a job template.

If you need to expose additional directories, you must customize your playbook runs. 
To configure job isolation, you can set variables.

By default, {ControllerName} uses the system's `tmp` directory (`/tmp` by default) as its staging area. 
This can be changed in the *Job Execution Path* field of the *Jobs settings* page, or in the REST API at `/api/v2/settings/jobs`:

[options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
AWX_ISOLATION_BASE_PATH = "/opt/tmp"
----

If there are any additional directories that should specifically be exposed from the host to the container that playbooks run in, you can specify those in the *Paths to expose to isolated jobs* field of the *Jobs Settings* page, or in the REST API at `/api/v2/settings/jobs`:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
AWX_ISOLATION_SHOW_PATHS = ['/list/of/', '/paths']
----

[NOTE]
====
If your playbooks need to use keys or settings defined in `AWX_ISOLATION_SHOW_PATHS`, then add this file to `/var/lib/awx/.ssh`.

The fields described here can be found on the *Jobs settings* page:
