= Back up your {PlatformNameShort} deployment

[role="_abstract"]

Regularly backing up your *{PlatformNameShort}* deployment is vital to protect against unexpected data loss and application errors. *{PlatformNameShort}* hosts any enabled components (such as, {ControllerName}, {HubName}, and {EDAName}), when you back up *{PlatformNameShort}* the operator will also back up these components.

[NOTE]
====
{OperatorPlatformNameShort} creates a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) for your {PlatformNameShort} Backup automatically.
You can use your own pre-created PVC by using the `backup_pvc` spec and specifying your PVC.
====

.Prerequisites

* You must be authenticated on OpenShift cluster.
* You have installed {OperatorPlatformNameShort} on the cluster.
* You have deployed a *{PlatformNameShort}* instance using the {OperatorPlatformNameShort}.

.Procedure 

. Log in to {OCP}.
. Navigate to menu:Operators[Installed Operators].
. Select your {OperatorPlatformNameShort} deployment.
. Go to your *All Instances* tab, and click btn:[Create New].
. Select *{PlatformNameShort} Backup* from the list.
+
[NOTE]
====
When creating the *{PlatformNameShort} Backup* resource it also creates backup resources for each of the nested components that are enabled.
====
+
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the backup.
. In the *Deployment name* field, enter the name of the deployed {PlatformNameShort} instance being backed up. For example if your {PlatformNameShort} deployment must be backed up and the deployment name is aap, enter 'aap' in the *Deployment name* field.
. Click btn:[Create]. This results in an *AnsibleAutomationPlatformBackup* resource similar to the following:
+
----
apiVersion: aap.ansible.com/v1alpha1
kind: AnsibleAutomationPlatformBackup
metadata:
  name: backup
  namespace: aap
spec:
  no_log: true
  deployment_name: aap
----
+

.Verification 

To verify that your backup was successful you can:

. Log in to {OCP}.
. Navigate to menu:Operators[Installed Operators].
. Select your {OperatorPlatformNameShort} deployment.
. Click *All Instances*.

The *All Instances* page displays the main backup and the backups for each component with the name you specified when creating your backup resource. 
The status for the following instances must be either *Running* or *Successful*:

* AnsibleAutomationPlatformBackup
* AutomationControllerBackup
* EDABackup
* AutomationHubBackup
