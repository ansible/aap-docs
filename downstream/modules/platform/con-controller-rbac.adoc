= Role-Based Access Controls

_Role-Based Access Controls_ (RBAC) are built into {ControllerName} and enable administrators to delegate access to server inventories, organizations,
and more. 
Administrators can also centralize the management of various credentials, enabling users to use a required secret without exposing that secret to the user. 
You can use RBAC to enable {ControllerName} to increase security and streamline management.

RBAC is the practice of granting roles to users or teams.
RBACs can be thought of in terms of Roles which define precisely who or what can see, change, or delete an "object" for which a specific capability is being set. 

The main concepts of {ControllerName}'s RBAC design roles, resources, and users are as follows: 

* Users can be members of a role, which gives them certain access to any resources associated with that role, or any resources associated with "descendant" roles.
* A role is a collection of capabilities. 
* Users are granted access to these capabilities and the {ControllerName}'s resources through the roles to which they are assigned or through roles inherited through the role hierarchy.
* Roles associate a group of capabilities with a group of users. 
All capabilities are derived from membership within a role. 
Users receive capabilities only through the roles to which they are assigned or through roles they inherit through the role hierarchy. 
All members of a role have all capabilities granted to that role. 
Within an organization, roles are relatively stable, while users and capabilities are both numerous and may change rapidly. 
* Users can have many roles.
