= Filtering instances returned by the dynamic inventory sources in the controller

By default, the dynamic inventory sources in {ControllerName} (such as AWS and Google) return all instances available to the cloud credentials being used. 
They are automatically joined into groups based on various attributes. 
For example, AWS instances are grouped by region, by tag name, value, and security groups. 
To target specific instances in your environment, write your playbooks so that they target the generated group names. 

For example:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
---
- hosts: tag_Name_webserver
  tasks:
  ...
----

You can also use the `Limit` field in the Job Template settings to limit a playbook run to a certain group, groups, hosts, or a combination of them. 
The syntax is the same as the `--limit parameter` on the ansible-playbook command line.

You can also create your own groups by copying the auto-generated groups into your custom groups. 
Make sure that the `Overwrite` option is disabled on your dynamic inventory source, otherwise subsequent synchronization operations delete and replace your custom groups.
