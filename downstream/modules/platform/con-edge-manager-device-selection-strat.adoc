= Device selection strategy

[role="_abstract"]

The {RedHatEdge} supports only the `BatchSequence` strategy for device selection. 
This strategy defines a stepwise rollout process where devices are added in batches based on specific criteria.
Batches are executed sequentially. 

After each batch completes, execution proceeds to the next batch only if the success rate of the previous batch meets or exceeds the configured success threshold. 

The success rate is determined as:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
# of successful rollouts in the batch / # of devices in the batch >= success threshold
----

In a batch sequence, the final batch is an implicit batch and it is not specified in the batch sequence. 
It selects all devices in a fleet that have not been selected by the explicit batches in the sequence.
