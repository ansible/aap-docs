. Click btn:[Create New subscription allocation] to create a new subscription allocation.
+
[NOTE]
====
If *Create New subscription allocation* is not present, or disabled, you do not have the proper permissions to create subscription allocations. 
To create a subscription allocation, you must either be an Administrator on the Customer Portal, or have the Manage Your Subscriptions role. 
Contact an `access.redhat.com` administrator, or organization administrator who can grant you permission to manage subscriptions.
====

. Enter a *Name* for your subscription and select *Satellite 6.13* from the *Type* drop-down menu.

== Setting up a subscriptions manifest

To obtain a subscriptions manifest, you must add an entitlement to your subscriptions through the *Subscriptions* tab.

+
You can select multiple {PlatformNameShort} subscriptions in your subscription allocation. 
Valid {PlatformNameShort} subscriptions commonly go by the name _"Red Hat Ansible Automationâ€¦"_.
. Specify the number of entitlements or managed nodes to put in the manifest file. 
This enables you to split up a subscription, for example: 400 nodes on a development cluster and 600 nodes for the production cluster, out of a 1000 node subscription.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can apply multiple subscriptions to a single installation by adding multiple subscriptions of the same type to a manifest file and uploading them. 
Similarly, a subset of a subscription can be applied by only allocating a portion of the subscription when creating the manifest.
====

. Click btn:[Submit].
. The allocations you specified, when successfully added, are displayed in the *Subscriptions* tab.
. Click the *Details* tab to access the subscription manifest file.
. Click btn:[Export Manifest] to export the manifest file for this subscription.
A folder pre-pended with `manifest_` is downloaded to your local drive. 
Multiple subscriptions with the same SKU are aggregated.
. When you have a subscription manifest, go to the Subscription screen. 
. Click btn:[Browse] to upload the entire manifest file. 
. Navigate to the location where the file is saved. 
Do not open it or upload individual parts of it.
