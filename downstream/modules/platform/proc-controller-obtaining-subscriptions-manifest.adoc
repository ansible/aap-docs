//+
. Click btn:[Create New subscription allocation].
+
[NOTE]
====
If *Create New subscription allocation* does not display, or is disabled, you do not have the proper permissions to create subscription allocations. 
To create a subscription allocation, you must either be an Administrator on the Red Hat Customer Portal, or have the *Manage Your Subscriptions* role. 
Contact an `access.redhat.com` administrator, or organization administrator who can grant you permission to manage subscriptions.
====

. Enter a *Name* for your subscription and select *{SatelliteVers}* from the *Type* drop-down menu.
+

+
. Click btn:[Create].

When your subscriptions manifest is successfully created, the number indicated next to *Entitlements* indicates the number of entitlements associated with your subscription.

== Setting up a subscriptions manifest

To obtain a subscriptions manifest, you must add an entitlement to your subscriptions through the *Subscriptions* tab.

.Procedure
. Click the *Subscriptions* tab.
. If there are no subscriptions to display, click btn:[Add Subscriptions].
. On the following screen you can select and add entitlements to put in the manifest file. 
+

+
You can select multiple {PlatformNameShort} subscriptions in your subscription allocation. 
Valid {PlatformNameShort} subscriptions commonly go by the name _"Red Hat Ansible Automationâ€¦"_.
. Specify the number of entitlements or managed nodes to put in the manifest file. 
This enables you to split up a subscription, for example: 400 nodes on a development cluster and 600 nodes for the production cluster, out of a 1000 node subscription.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can apply multiple subscriptions to a single installation by adding multiple subscriptions of the same type to a manifest file and uploading them. 
Similarly, you can apply a subset of a subscription by only allocating a part of the subscription when creating the manifest.
====

. Click btn:[Submit].
+
The allocations you specified, when successfully added, are displayed in the *Subscriptions* tab.
. Click the *Details* tab to access the subscription manifest file.
. Click btn:[Export Manifest] to export the manifest file for this subscription.
A folder pre-pended with `manifest_` is downloaded to your local drive. 
Multiple subscriptions with the same SKU are aggregated.
. When you have a subscription manifest, go to the Subscription screen. 
. Click btn:[Browse] to upload the entire manifest file. 
. Navigate to the location where the file is saved. 
Do not open it or upload individual parts of it.
