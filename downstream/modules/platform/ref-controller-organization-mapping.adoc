= Organization mapping

You can control which users are placed into which {PlatformNameShort} organizations based on attributes like their username and email address or based on groups provided from an authenticator. 

When organization mapping is positively evaluated, a specified organization is created, if it does not exist if the authenticator tied to the map is allowed to create objects.

.Procedure

. Enter a unique rule *Name* to identify the rule.
. Select a *Trigger* from the list. See xref:gw-authenticator-map-triggers[Authenticator map triggers] for more information about map triggers.
. Select *Revoke* to deny user access to the system when none of the trigger conditions are matched. 
. Select the *Organization* to which matching users are added or blocked.
. Select a *Role* to be applied or removed for matching users (for example, *Organization Admin* or *Organization Member*).
