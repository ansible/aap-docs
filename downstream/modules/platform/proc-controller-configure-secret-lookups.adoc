= Configuring and linking secret lookups

When pulling a secret from a third-party system, you are in essence linking credential fields to external systems. 
To link a credential field to a value stored in an external system, select the external credential corresponding to that system and provide `metadata` to look up the desired value. The metadata input fields are part of the `external credential type` definition of the `source credential`.

{ControllerNameStart} provides a `credential plugin` interface for developers, integrators, system administrators, and power-users with the ability to add new external credential types to extend it to support other secret management systems. 

For more information, see the development documents for
link:https://github.com/ansible/awx/blob/devel/docs/credentials/credential_plugins.md[Credential plugins].

Use the following procedure to use {ControllerName} to configure and use each of the supported third-party secret management systems.

.Procedure
. Create an external credential for authenticating with the secret management system. At minimum, provide a name for the external credential and select one of the following for the *Credential Type*:
+
* xref:ref-aws-secrets-manager-lookup[AWS Secrets Manager Lookup]
* xref:ref-centrify-vault-lookup[Centrify Vault Credential Provider Lookup]
* xref:ref-cyberark-ccp-lookup[CyberArk Central Credential Provider (CCP) Lookup]
* xref:ref-cyberark-conjur-lookup[CyberArk Conjur Secrets Manager Lookup]
* xref:ref-hashicorp-vault-lookup[HashiCorp Vault Secret Lookup]
* xref:ref-hashicorp-signed-ssh[HashiCorp Vault Signed SSH]
* xref:ref-azure-key-vault-lookup[{Azure} Key Vault]
* xref:ref-thycotic-devops-vault[Thycotic DevOps Secrets Vault]
* xref:ref-thycotic-secret-server[Thycotic Secret Server]
+
In this example, the _Demo Credential_ is the target credential.

. For any of the fields that follow the *Type Details* area that you want to link to the external credential, click the image:leftkey.png[Link,15,15] icon in the input field to link one or more input fields to the external credential along with metadata for locating the secret in the external system.

+
You are prompted to set the input source to use to retrieve your secret information.

. Select the credential you want to link to, and click btn:[Next]. 
This takes you to the *Metadata* tab of the input source. 
This example shows the Metadata prompt for HashiVault Secret Lookup. 
Metadata is specific to the input source you select. 

For more information, see the xref:ref-controller-metadata-credential-input[Metadata for credential input sources] table.

. Click btn:[Test] to verify connection to the secret management system. 
If the lookup is unsuccessful, an error message similar to the following displays:
+
image:credentials-link-metadata-test-error.png[Exception]

. Click btn:[OK]. 
You are returned to the *Details* screen of your target credential. 
. Repeat these steps, starting with Step 3 to complete the remaining input fields for the target credential. 
By linking the information in this manner, {ControllerName} retrieves sensitive information, such as username, password, keys, certificates, and tokens from the third-party management systems and populates the remaining fields of the target credential form with that data.
. If necessary, supply any information manually for those fields that do not use linking as a way of retrieving sensitive information. 
For more information about each of the fields, see the appropriate xref:ref-controller-credential-types[Credential Types].
. Click btn:[Save].
