= Pagerduty

To integrate Pagerduty, you must first create an API key in the link:http://docs.grafana.org/tutorials/api_org_token_howto/[PagerDuty system].
This is the token that is given to {ControllerName}.
Then create a *Service* which provides an *Integration Key* that is also given to {ControllerName}. 

Provide the following details to set up a Pagerduty notification:

* *API Token*: You must first create an API key in the Pagerduty system.
This is the token that is given to {ControllerName}.
* *PagerDuty subdomain*: When you sign up for the Pagerduty account, you receive a unique subdomain to communicate with. 
For example, if you signed up as "testuser", the web dashboard is at `testuser.pagerduty.com` and you give the API `testuser` as the subdomain, not the full domain.
* *API service/Integration Key*: Enter the API service/integration key created in Pagerduty.
* *Client Identifier*: This is sent along with the alert content to the Pagerduty service to help identify the service that is using the API key and service. 
This is helpful if multiple integrations are using the same API key and service.
