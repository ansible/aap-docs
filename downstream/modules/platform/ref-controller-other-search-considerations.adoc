= Other search considerations

Be aware of the following issues when searching in {ControllerName}:

* There is currently no supported syntax for *OR* queries. 
All search terms are **AND**ed in the query parameters.
* The left-hand portion of a search parameter can be wrapped in quotes
to support searching for strings with spaces. For more information, see xref:ref-controller-search-tips[Tips for searching].
* Currently, the values in the Fields are direct attributes expected to be returned in a *GET* request. 
Whenever you search against one of the values, {ControllerName} carries out an `__icontains` search. 
So, for example, `name:localhost` sends back `+?name__icontains=localhost+`.
{ControllerNameStart} currently performs this search for every Field value, even `id`.
