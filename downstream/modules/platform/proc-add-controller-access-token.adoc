= Connecting {OperatorResourceShort} to platform gateway

To connect {OperatorResourceShort} with platform gateway you need to create a k8s secret with the connection information for your {ControllerName} instance.

NOTE: You can only create OAuth 2 Tokens for your own user through the API or UI, which means you can only configure or view tokens from your own user profile.

.Procedure
To create an OAuth2 token for your user in the platform gateway UI:

. Log in to {OCP}. 
. In the navigation panel, select menu:Access Management[Users].
. Select the username you want to create a token for.
. Select menu:Tokens[Automation Execution]
. Click btn:[Create Token].
. You can leave *Applications* empty. Add a description and select *Read* or *Write* for the *Scope*.

[NOTE]
====
Make sure you provide a valid user when creating tokens. 
Otherwise, you will get an error message that you tried to issue the command without specifying a user, or supplying a username that does not exist.
