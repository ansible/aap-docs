= Connect {OperatorResourceShort} to {PlatformNameShort}

[role="_abstract"]

To connect {OperatorResourceShort} with {Gateway} you must create a Kubernetes secret with the connection information for your {ControllerName} instance.

Use the following procedure to create an OAuth2 token for your user in the {Gateway} UI.

[NOTE]
====
You can only create OAuth 2 Tokens for your own user through the API or UI, which means you can only configure or view tokens from your own user profile.

. In the navigation panel, select menu:Access Management[Users].
. Select the username you want to create a token for.
. Select menu:Tokens[Automation Execution]

Make sure you provide a valid user when creating tokens. 
Otherwise, you get an error message that you tried to issue the command without either specifying a user, or supplying a username that does not exist.
