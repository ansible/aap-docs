= Connecting {OperatorResourceShort} to {Gateway}

To connect {OperatorResourceShort} with {Gateway} you must create a Kubernetes secret with the connection information for your {ControllerName} instance.

You can only create OAuth 2 Tokens for your own user through the API or UI, which means you can only configure or view tokens from your own user profile.
