= Disruption budget parameters

[role="_abstract"]

Configure rollout disruption parameters, such as grouping criteria (`groupBy`) and availability limits (`minAvailable`, `maxUnavailable`), to control the maximum acceptable service impact during fleet updates and keep overall system stability.

* `groupBy`: Defines how devices are grouped when applying the disruption budget. 
The grouping is done by label keys.
* `minAvailable`: Specifies the minimum number of devices that must remain available during a rollout.
* `maxUnavailable`: Limits the number of devices that can be unavailable at the same time.

*Example*

The following shows an example YAML configuration for a fleet specification:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: v1alpha1
kind: Fleet
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      fleet: default
  rolloutPolicy:
    disruptionBudget:
      groupBy: ['site', 'function']
      minAvailable: 1
      maxUnavailable: 10
----

In this example, the grouping is performed on 2 label keys: *site* and *function*. 
A group for disruption budget consists of all devices in a fleet having the same label values for the preceding label keys. 
For every such group the conditions defined in this specification are continuously enforced.
