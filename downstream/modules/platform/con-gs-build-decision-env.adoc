= Build and use a decision environment

{EDAName} includes an ansible.eda collection, which contains sample sources, event filters and rulebooks. 
All the collections, ansible rulebooks and their dependencies use a decision environment, which is an image that can be run on either Podman or Kubernetes.

In decision environments, sources, which are typically Python code, are distributed through ansible-collections. 
They inject external events into a rulebook for processing. 
The rulebook consists of the following:

* The python interpreter
* Java Runtime Environment for Drools rule engine
* ansible-rulebook python package
* ansible.eda collection

You can use the base decision environment and build your own customized Decision Environments with additional collections and collection dependencies. 
You can build a decision environment using a Dockerfile or optionally you can deploy your CA certificate into the image.
