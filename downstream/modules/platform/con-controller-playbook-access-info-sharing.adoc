= Playbook access and information sharing

{ControllerNameStart}'s use of automation {ExecEnvShort}s and Linux containers prevents playbooks from reading files outside of their project directory.

By default, the only data exposed to the ansible-playbook process inside the container is the current project being used.

You can customize this in the Job Settings and expose additional directories from the host into the container.
