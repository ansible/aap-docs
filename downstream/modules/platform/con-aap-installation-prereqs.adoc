= Prerequisites

[role="_abstract"]
Prerequisites define the software, accounts, and system configuration required to successfully install {PlatformNameShort}. Meeting these pre-installation requirements ensures system compatibility, prevents common errors (such as those caused by out-of-date RHEL nodes), and verifies you have access to the necessary installation files.

* You chose and obtained a platform installer from the link:{PlatformDownloadUrl}[{PlatformName} Product Software].
* You are installing on a machine that meets base system requirements.
* You have updated all of the packages to the recent version of your RHEL nodes.

WARNING: To prevent errors, upgrade your RHEL nodes fully before installing {PlatformNameShort}.

* You have created a Red Hat Registry Service Account, by using the instructions in link:https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication#creating-registry-service-accounts-6[Creating Registry Service Accounts].
