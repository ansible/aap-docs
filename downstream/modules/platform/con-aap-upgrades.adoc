= {PlatformNameShort} upgrades

Currently, it is possible to perform {PlatformNameShort} upgrades using one of the following supported upgrade paths. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Upgrade from {EDAName} 2.5 to 2.6 is supported; however, upgrade from {EDAName} 2.4 to 2.6 is not supported. If you are upgrading from {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 to 2.6 and you have deployed {EDAName}, you must first remove the {EDAName} 2.4 database and then upgrade your platform to 2.6. For information about the procedure, see xref:proc-removing-eda-db_aap-upgrading-platform[Removing {EDAName} 2.4 database].
