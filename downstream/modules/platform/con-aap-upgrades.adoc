[IMPORTANT]
====
Upgrading from {EDAName} 2.4 is not supported. If you are upgrading from {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 to 2.5 and you have deployed {EDAName}, you must first remove the {EDAName} 2.4 database and then upgrade your platform to 2.5. For information about the procedure, see xref:proc-removing-eda-db_aap-upgrading-platform[Removing Event-Driven Ansible 2.4 database].
