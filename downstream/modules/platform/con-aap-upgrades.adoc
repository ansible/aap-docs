= {PlatformNameShort} upgrades

[role="_abstract"]
You can upgrade your {PlatformNameShort} installation from version 2.4 or 2.5 to {PlatformVers} using the supported upgrade paths. Review the available upgrade paths and required steps to ensure a successful upgrade of your {PlatformNameShort} environment.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Upgrade from {EDAName} 2.5 to 2.6 is supported; however, upgrade from {EDAName} 2.4 to 2.6 is not supported. If you are upgrading from {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 to 2.6 and you have deployed {EDAName}, you must first remove the {EDAName} 2.4 database and then upgrade your platform to 2.6. For information about the procedure, see xref:proc-removing-eda-db_aap-upgrading-platform[Removing {EDAName} 2.4 database].

Before beginning your upgrade be sure to review the prerequisites and upgrade planning sections of this guide.
