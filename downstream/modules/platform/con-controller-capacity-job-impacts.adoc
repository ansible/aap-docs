= Job type impact on capacity

[role="_abstract"]
When configuring {ControllerName} capacity, it is important to understand how different job types impact the system capacity.

{ControllerName} uses Ansible to run jobs. Each job can have a different impact on system resources depending on the number of forks used for the job.

The default forks value for Ansible is five. 
This means that, by default, each job can run tasks on up to five systems concurrently.

However, if you set up {ControllerName} to run against fewer systems than that, then the actual concurrency value is lower.

When a job is run in {ControllerName}, the number of forks selected  is incremented by 1, to compensate for the Ansible parent process.  

For example, if you run a playbook against five systems with forks value of 5, then the actual forks value from the Job Impact perspective is 6.
