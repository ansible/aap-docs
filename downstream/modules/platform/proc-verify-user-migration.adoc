= Verify user migration

[role="_abstract"]
During the upgrade to {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers}, controller user accounts are converted into platform user accounts. 
Controller administrators retain their administrative privileges, but they are converted into platform administrator privileges. 

Other controller accounts become platform users, and their existing permissions are mapped over appropriately after an initial password reset. Users with existing accounts associated with other components (like {PrivateHubName} and {EDAName}) must have their passwords reset by their administrator before they can log in.

Authenticator configurations are automatically migrated. SSO and LDAP accounts do not require any manual migration steps, including password resets, with the exception of accounts that use a certificate from the trust store. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.6/html/planning_your_upgrade[Configuring authentication in the {PlatformNameShort}] for more information on migrating authentication configurations that use a custom certificate.

After your upgrade to {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers} is complete, verify that you can log in to the upgraded platform.

.Procedure

* If you have a controller account that has been converted to a {Gateway} account for {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers}:

** Log into your upgraded platform instance with your controller credentials.

* If you have a component-level account (such as an account associated with {PrivateHubName} or {EDAName}):

** Request a password reset from your administrator and log into the upgraded platform with your new password.
