= Backup and restore clustered environments

The procedure for backup and restore for a clustered environment is similar to a single install, except for some of the following considerations:

[NOTE]
====
For more information on installing clustered environments, see the xref:controller-cluster-install[Install and configure] section.
====

* If restoring to a new cluster, ensure that the old cluster is shut down before proceeding because they can conflict with each other when accessing the database.
* Per-node backups are only restored to nodes bearing the same hostname as the backup.
* When restoring to an existing cluster, the restore contains the following:

** A dump of the PostgreSQL database
** UI artifacts, included in the database dump
** An {ControllerName} configuration (retrieved from `/etc/tower`)
** An {ControllerName} secret key
** Manual projects
