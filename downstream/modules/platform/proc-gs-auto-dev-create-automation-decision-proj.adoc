= Creating an automation decision project

Like automation execution projects, automation decision projects are logical collections of automation decision content. 
You can use the project function to organize your automation decision content in a way that makes sense to you.

.Prerequisites

* You have set up any neccessary credentials.
For more information, see the link:{URLEDAUserGuide}/eda-credentials#eda-set-up-credential[Setting up credentials] section of the {TitleEDAUserGuide} guide.
* You have an existing repository containing rulebooks that are integrated with playbooks contained in a repository to be used by {ControllerName}.

.Procedure

. From the navigation panel, select *{MenuADProjects}*.
. Click btn:[Create project].
. Enter the following information:
* *Name*: Enter project name.
* *Description*: This field is optional.
* *Organization*: Select the organization associated with the project.  
* *Source control type*: Git is the only SCM type available for use.
* *Proxy*: Proxy used to access HTTP or HTTPS servers.
* *Source control branch/tag/commit*: Branch to checkout. Can also be tags, commit hashes, or arbitrary refs.
* *Source control refspec*: A refspec to fetch. This parameter allows access to references through the branch field not otherwise available.
* Optional: *Source control credential*: The token needed to use the source control URL.
* *Content signature validation credential*: Enables content signing to verify that the content has remained secure during project syncing. If the content is tampered with, the job will not run.
