= Creating an automation decision project

Like automation execution projects, automation decision projects are logical collections of automation decision content. 
You can use the project function to organize your automation decision content in a way that makes sense to you.

* You are logged in to the {EDAcontroller} Dashboard as a Content Consumer.
* You have set up a credential, if necessary.
For more information, see the [ADD 2.5 LINK][Setting up credentials] section.
* You have an existing repository containing rulebooks that are integrated with playbooks contained in a repository to be used by {ControllerName}.
