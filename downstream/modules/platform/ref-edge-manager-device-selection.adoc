= Device selection into a fleet

[role="_abstract"]

By default, devices are not assigned to a fleet.
Instead, each fleet uses a selector that defines which labels a device must have to be added to the fleet.

To understand how to use labels in a fleet, see the following example.

The following list shows point-of-sales terminal devices and their labels:

|===
|Device |Labels
|A |`type: pos-terminal`, `region: east`, `stage: production`
|B |`type: pos-terminal`, `region: east`, `stage: development`
|C |`type: pos-terminal`, `region: west`, `stage: production`
|D |`type: pos-terminal`, `region: west`, `stage: development`
|===

If all point-of-sale terminals use the same configuration and are managed by the same operations team, you can define a single fleet called `pos-terminals` with the `type=pos-terminal` label selector.
Then, the fleet contains devices A, B, C, and D.

However, you might want to create separate fleets for the different organizations for development or production.
You can define a fleet for development with the `type=pos-terminal, stage=development` label selector, which selects devices C and D.
Then, you can define another fleet for production with the `type=pos-terminal, stage=production` label selector.
By using the correct label selectors, you can manage both fleets independently.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must define selectors in a way that two fleets do not select the same device.
For example, if one fleet selects `region=east`, and another fleet selects `stage=production`, both fleets try to select device A.
If two fleets try to select the same device, the {RedHatEdge} keeps the device in the currently assigned fleet, if any, and sets the `OverlappingSelectors` condition on the affected fleets to `true`.
