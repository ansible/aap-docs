RHV credentials require the following inputs:

* *Host (Authentication URL)*: The host URL or IP address to connect to.
To sync with the inventory, the credential URL needs to include the `ovirt-engine/api` path.
* *Username*: The username to use to connect to oVirt4. This must include the domain profile to succeed, for example
`username@ovirt.host.com`.
* *Password*: The password to use to connect to it.
* Optional: *CA File*: Provide an absolute path to the oVirt certificate file (it may end in `.pem`, `.cer` and `.crt` extensions, but preferably `.pem` for consistency)
