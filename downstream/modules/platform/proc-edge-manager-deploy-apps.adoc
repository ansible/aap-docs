= Deploying applications to a device using the CLI

[role="_abstract"]

Deploy application packages securely from an OCI registry onto a target device by using the {RedHatEdge} CLI. 
Specifying the container image reference in the device manifest automatically triggers the transactional deployment through the device agent.

.Procedure

. Specify the application package that you want to deploy in the `spec.applications` field in the `Device` resource:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: flightctl.io/v1alpha1
kind: Device
metadata:
  name: <device_name>
spec:
[...]
  applications:
  - name: wordpress
    image: quay.io/rhem-demos/wordpress-app:latest
    envVars:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: <database_host>
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: <user_name>
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: <password>
[...]
