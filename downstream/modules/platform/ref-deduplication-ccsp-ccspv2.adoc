[id="ref-deduplication-ccsp-ccspv2"]

= Deduplication in the CCSP or CCSPv2 reports

The default value for `METRICS_UTILITY_DEDUPLICATOR= ccsp`. This limits deduplication to hostnames only.

The `ansible_host` variable, from `main_host.variables`, is preferred over `host_name`, from `main_jobhostsummary`, when present.

You can also set `METRICS_UTILITY_DEDUPLICATOR=ccsp-experimental`. This setting merges entries when both their `ansible_product_serial` and `ansible_machine_id` facts are present and duplicated.
