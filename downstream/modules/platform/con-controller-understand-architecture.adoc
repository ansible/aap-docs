= Understand the architecture of {PlatformNameShort} and {ControllerName}

{PlatformNameShort} and {ControllerName} comprise a general-purpose, declarative automation platform. 
That means that once an Ansible playbook is launched (by {ControllerName}, or directly on the command line), the playbook, inventory, and credentials provided to Ansible are considered to be the source of truth. 
If you want policies around external verification of specific playbook content, job definition, or inventory contents, you must complete these processes before the automation is launched, either by the {ControllerName} web UI, or the {ControllerName} API.

The use of source control, branching, and mandatory code review is best practice for Ansible automation. 
There are tools that can help create process flow around using source control in this manner.

At a higher level, tools exist that enable creation of approvals and policy-based actions around arbitrary workflows, including automation. 
These tools can then use Ansible through the {ControllerName}'s API to perform automation.

You must use a secure default administration password at the time of {ControllerName} installation.
For more information, see xref:ref-controller-change-admin-password[Changing the Controller Administrator Password].

{ControllerNameStart} exposes services on certain well-known ports, such as port 80 for HTTP traffic and port 443 for HTTPS traffic. 
Do not expose {ControllerName} on the open internet, which reduces the threat surface of your installation.

== Granting access

Granting access to certain parts of the system exposes security risks. 
Apply the following practices to help secure access:

* xref:controller-minimize-administrative-accounts[Minimize administrative accounts]
* xref:controller-minimize-system-access[Minimize local system access]
* xref:controller-remove-access-credentials[Remove access to credentials from users]
* xref:controller-enforce-separation-duties[Enforce separation of duties]
