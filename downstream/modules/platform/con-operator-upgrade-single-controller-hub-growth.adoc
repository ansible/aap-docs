= Upgrading a 2.4 single {ControllerName} and {HubName} deployment to a {PlatformVers} {GrowthTopology}

[role="_abstract"]
Upgrade your 2.4 single-node deployment ({ControllerName} and {HubName}) to a {PlatformVers} {GrowthTopology}. 
Review the infrastructure changes and requirements needed to successfully plan your upgrade.
