= Introduction

Resource Operator is a customer resource (CR) that you can deploy after you have created your {ControllerName} deployment. Resource Operator allows you to define projects, job templates, and inventories through the use of YAML files. These YAML files are then used by {ControllerName} to create these resources. You can create the YAML through a form view that prompts you for keys and values for your YAML code. Alternatively, to work with  YAML directly, you can select YAML view. 

There are currently two custom resources provided by the resource-operator-controller-manager:

* AnsibleJob: launches a job in the {ControllerName} instance specified in the Kubernetes secret ({ControllerName} host url, token).
* JobTemplate: creates a job template in the {ControllerName} instance specified.
