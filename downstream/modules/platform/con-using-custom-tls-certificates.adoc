= Configuring custom TLS certificates

[role="_abstract"]
{PlatformName} uses X.509 certificate and key pairs to secure traffic. These certificates secure internal traffic between {PlatformNameShort} components and external traffic for public UI and API connections. 

There are two primary ways to manage TLS certificates for your {PlatformNameShort} deployment: 

. {PlatformNameShort} generated certificates (this is the default)
. User-provided certificates
