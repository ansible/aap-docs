= Migrating SAML users
 
[role="_abstract"]

When upgrading from {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 to 2.5, you can migrate your SAML users to ensure authentication remains seamless and secure after the upgrade. Follow the steps in this procedure to ensure a smooth SAML user migration. 

== Important notes

*SAML migration is not currently supported in the UI:* While migration of SAML accounts is supported in 2.5, the configuration must be done through the API `/api/gateway/v1/authenticators/`.

*Migration of SAML must happen before users log in and start account linking:* You must enable the Auto migrate users setting after configuring SAML in 2.5 and before any users log in.

.Prerequisistes

You have configured a SAML authentication method in the platform gateway following the steps in link:{URLCentralAuth}/gw-configure-authentication#controller-set-up-SAML[Configuring SAML authentication]. This will be the configuration that you will migrate your previous SAML users to. 

. Log in to the platform gateway API.
. Go to `/api/gateway/v1/authenticators/`, locate the legacy SAML authenticator and click the link. 
. This opens the HTML form for that authenticator. 
. Select the new platform gateway SAML authenticator from the *Auto migrate users to* list. 
. Click btn:[PUT]. 

Once you set up the auto migrate functionality, you should be able to login with SAML in the platform gateway and it will automatically link any matching accounts from the legacy SAML authenticator.
