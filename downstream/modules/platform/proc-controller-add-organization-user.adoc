= Adding a user to an organization

You can provide a user with access to an organization by adding them to the organization and managing the roles associated with the user. To add a user to an organization, the user must already exist. For more information, see xref:proc-controller-creating-a-user[Creating a user]. 
To add roles for a user, the role must already exist. See xref:proc-gw-create-roles[Creating a role] for more information.

The following tab selections are available when adding users to an organization. When user accounts from the {ControllerName} organization have been migrated to {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 during the upgrade process, the *Automation Execution* tab shows content based on whether the users were added to the organization prior to migration.  

{PlatformNameShort}:: Reflects all users added to the organization at the platform level. From this tab, you can add users as organization members and, optionally provide specific organization level roles.

Automation Execution:: Reflects users that were added directly to the {ControllerName} organization prior to an upgrade and migration. From this tab, you can only view existing memberships in {ControllerName} and remove those memberships but not you can not add new memberships. 

New user memberships to an organization must be added at the platform level.
