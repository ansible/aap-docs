= Adding a user to an organization

You can provide a user with access to an organization by adding them to the organization and managing the roles associated with the user. To add a user to an organization, the user must already exist. For more information, see xref:proc-controller-creating-a-user[Creating a user]. 
To add roles for a user, the role must already exist. See xref:proc-gw-roles_auto-eec[Automation execution roles] and xref:proc-gw-roles_auto-dec[Automation decision] roles for more information about creating new roles.
