= Assigning a user to an organization

[role="_abstract"]

You can give a user with access to an organization, and therefore the resources within the organization, by assigning them to the organization and managing the organization roles associated with the user. 

You can view a list of users associated with an organization, along with the roles each user is directly assigned, in the organization's *Users* tab. 
When you manage a user's organization roles in the *Users* tab, you can also see how the user was assigned their roles, whether indirectly, through association with a team, or through direct user assignment by an administrator. 

[NOTE]

====
If a user is assigned a "team member" role, this likely indicates that they have an indirectly-assigned role. To see a user's indirectly-assigned roles, click the pencil icon image:leftpencil.png[Edit page,15,15] to view and manage roles, and then click the link labeled *View indirectly-assigned organization roles* in the page banner.

To assign a user to an organization, the user must already exist. For more information, see link:{URLCentralAuth}/gw-managing-access#proc-controller-creating-a-user[Creating a user]. 
To assign roles to a user, the role must already exist. See link:{URLCentralAuth}/assembly-gw-roles#proc-gw-create-roles[Creating a role] for more information.

// [[hherbly] removed for 2.6] The following tab selections are available when adding users to an organization. When user accounts from the {ControllerName} organization have been migrated to {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 during the upgrade process, the *Automation Execution* tab shows content based on whether the users were added to the organization prior to migration.  

// {PlatformNameShort}:: Reflects all users added to the organization at the platform level. From this tab, you can add users as organization members and, optionally provide specific organization level roles.

// Automation Execution:: Reflects users that were added directly to the {ControllerName} organization prior to an upgrade and migration. From this tab, you can only view existing memberships in {ControllerName} and remove those memberships but not you can not add new memberships. 

// New user memberships to an organization must be added at the platform level.

. To remove a particular user from the organization, select *Remove user* from the btn:[More Actions] *{MoreActionsIcon}* list next to the user.

. To manage roles for users in an organization, click the *{SettingsIcon}* icon next to the user and select *Manage roles*. You can manage organization roles that are directly assigned to a user by selecting or clearing the checkboxes.
