= Specify applications inline in the device specification

Application manifests are specified inline in a device's specification, so you do not need to build an OCI registry application package.
 
The inline application provider accepts a list of application content with the following parameters:
 
|===
| Parameter | Description 
| Path | The relative path to the file on the device. Note that any existing file is overwritten. 
| Content (Optional) | The plain text (UTF-8) or base64-encoded content of the file. 
| ContentEncoding | How the contents are encoded. Must be either "plain" or "base64". Defaults to "plain". 
|===

*Example*

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: flightctl.io/v1alpha1
kind: Device
metadata:
  name: some_device_name
spec:
[...]
  applications:
    - name: my-app
      appType: compose
      inline:
        - content: |
            version: "3.8"
            services:
              service1:
                image:  quay.io/flightctl-tests/alpine:v1
                command: ["sleep", "infinity"]
          path: podman-compose.yaml
[...]

[NOTE]
====
Inline compose applications can have two paths at most. 
You must name the first one `podman-compose.yaml`, and the second (override) `podman-compose.override.yaml`.
