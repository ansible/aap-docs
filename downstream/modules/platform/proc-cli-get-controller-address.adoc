= Fetch the {Gateway} web address

[role="_abstract"]

A {OCP} route exposes a service at a host name, so that external clients can reach it by name.
When you created the {Gateway} instance, a route was created for it.
The route inherits the name that you assigned to the {Gateway} object in the YAML file.

.Procedure

* Use the following command to fetch the routes:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
-----
oc get routes -n __<platform_namespace>__

.Verification 

You can see in the following example, the `_example_` {Gateway} is running in the `_ansible-automation-platform_` namespace.

-----
$ oc get routes -n ansible-automation-platform

NAME      HOST/PORT                                              PATH   SERVICES          PORT   TERMINATION     WILDCARD
example   example-ansible-automation-platform.apps-crc.testing          example-service   http   edge/Redirect   None

The address for the {Gateway} instance is `example-ansible-automation-platform.apps-crc.testing`.
