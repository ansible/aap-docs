= Backup and restore playbooks

In addition to the `install.yml` file included with your `setup.sh` setup playbook, there are also `backup.yml` and `restore.yml` files.

These playbooks serve to backup and restore.

* The overall backup, backs up:
** The database
** The `SECRET_KEY` file
* The per-system backups include:
** Custom configuration files
** Manual projects
* The restore backup restores the backed up files and data to a freshly installed and working second instance of {ControllerName}.

When restoring your system, the installer checks to see that the backup file exists before beginning the restoration. 
If the backup file is not available, your restoration fails.

[NOTE]
====
Make sure that your {ControllerName} hosts are properly set up with SSH keys, user or pass variables in the hosts file, and that the user has `sudo` access.
