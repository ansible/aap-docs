= Gather logs from your containerized deployment

[role="_abstract"]
With the `sos` utility, you can collect configuration, diagnostic, and troubleshooting data, and give those files to Red Hat Technical Support. An `sos` report is a common starting point for Red Hat technical support engineers when performing analysis of a service request for {PlatformNameShort}. 

You can collect an `sos` report for each host in your containerized {PlatformNameShort} deployment by running the `log_gathering` playbook with the appropriate parameters.

.Procedure

. Go to the {PlatformNameShort} installation directory.

. Run the `log_gathering` playbook. This playbook connects to each host in the inventory file, installs the `sos` tool, and generates the `sos` report.

----
$ ansible-playbook -i <path_to_inventory_file> ansible.containerized_installer.log_gathering
----
+
. Optional: To define additional parameters, specify them with the `-e` option. For example:
+
----
$ ansible-playbook -i <path_to_inventory_file> ansible.containerized_installer.log_gathering -e 'target_sos_directory=<path_to_files>' -e 'case_number=0000000' -e 'clean=true' -e 'upload=true' -s
----
+
.. You can use the `-s` option to step through each task in the playbook and confirm its execution. This is optional but can be helpful for debugging.

.. The following is a list of the parameters you can use with the `log_gathering` playbook:
