= Fetching platform gateway login details from the {OCPShort} CLI

To login to the platform gateway, you need the web address and the password.

== Fetching the platform gateway web address

A {OCP} route exposes a service at a host name, so that external clients can reach it by name.
When you created the platform gateway instance, a route was created for it.
The route inherits the name that you assigned to the platform gateway object in the YAML file.

Use the following command to fetch the routes:

[subs="+quotes"]
-----
oc get routes -n __<platform_namespace>__
-----

In the following example, the `_example_` platform gateway is running in the `_ansible-automation-platform_` namespace.

-----
$ oc get routes -n ansible-automation-platform

NAME      HOST/PORT                                              PATH   SERVICES          PORT   TERMINATION     WILDCARD
example   example-ansible-automation-platform.apps-crc.testing          example-service   http   edge/Redirect   None
-----

The address for the platform gateway instance is `example-ansible-automation-platform.apps-crc.testing`.

== Fetching the platform gateway password

The YAML block for the platform gateway instance in the `AnsibleAutomationPlatform` object assigns values to the _name_ and _admin_user_ keys.
Use these values in the following command to fetch the password for the platform gateway instance.

-----
oc get secret/<your instance name>-<admin_user>-password -o yaml
-----

The default value for _admin_user_ is `_admin_`. Modify the command if you changed the admin username in the `AnsibleAutomationPlatform` object.

The following example retrieves the password for a platform gateway object called `_example_`: 

-----
oc get secret/example-admin-password -o yaml
-----

The base64 encoded password for the platform gateway instance is listed in the `metadata` field in the output:

-----
$ oc get secret/example-admin-password -o yaml

apiVersion: v1
data:
  password: ODzLODzLODzLODzLODzLODzLODzLODzLODzLODzLODzL
kind: Secret
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: aap
    app.kubernetes.io/name: example
    app.kubernetes.io/operator-version: ""
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: example
  name: example-admin-password
