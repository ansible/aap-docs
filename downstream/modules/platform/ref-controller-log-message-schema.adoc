= Log message schema

Common schema for all loggers:

* `cluster_host_id`: Unique identifier of the host within the {ControllerName} cluster.
* `level`: Standard python log level, roughly reflecting the significance of the event. 
All of the data loggers as a part of 'level' use `INFO` level, but the other {ControllerName} logs use different levels as appropriate.
* `logger_name`: Name of the logger we use in the settings, for example, "activity_stream".
* `@timestamp`: Time of log.
* `path`: File path in code where the log was generated.
