Use the following procedure to configure an AWS EC2-sourced inventory.

.Procedure
//[ddacosta] Rewrote this according to IBM style: Refer to a drop-down list by its label, followed by list.
. From the navigation panel, select {MenuInfrastructureInventories}.
. Select the inventory name you want a source to and click the *Sources* tab.
. Click btn:[Create source].
. In the *Create source* page, select *Amazon EC2* from the *Source* list.
. The *Create source* window expands with additional fields.
Enter the following details:

* Optional: *Credential*: Choose from an existing AWS credential.
For more information, see xref:controller-credentials[Managing user credentials].
+
If {ControllerName} is running on an EC2 instance with an assigned IAM Role, the credential can be omitted, and the security credentials from
the instance metadata are used instead.
For more information about using IAM Roles, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html[IAM roles for Amazon EC2_documentation_at_Amazon] documentation at Amazon.

. Optional: You can specify the verbosity, host filter, enabled variables or values, and update options as described in
xref:proc-controller-add-source[Adding a source].
. Use the *Source variables* field to override variables used by the `aws_ec2` inventory plugin.
Enter variables by using either JSON or YAML syntax.
Use the radio button to toggle between the two.
For more information about these variables, see the
link:https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/amazon/aws/content/inventory/aws_ec2[aws inventory plugin documentation].

.Troubleshooting

If you only use `include_filters`, the AWS plugin always returns all the hosts.
To use this correctly, the first condition on the `or` must be on `filters` and then build the rest of the `OR` conditions on a list of
`include_filters`.
