If {ControllerName} is running on an EC2 instance with an assigned IAM Role, the credential can be omitted, and the security credentials from
the instance metadata are used instead.
For more information on using IAM Roles, see link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-%20roles-for-amazon-ec2.html[IAM_Roles_for_Amazon_EC2_documentation_at_Amazon].

. Optional: You can specify the verbosity, host filter, enabled variables or values, and update options as described in
xref:proc-controller-add-source[Adding a source].
. Use the *Source Variables* field to override variables used by the `aws_ec2` inventory plugin.
Enter variables using either JSON or YAML syntax.

[NOTE]
====
If you only use `include_filters`, the AWS plugin always returns all the hosts.
To use this correctly, the first condition on the `or` must be on `filters` and then build the rest of the `OR` conditions on a list of
`include_filters`.
