= Installing containerized {PlatformNameShort}

After you prepare the {RHEL} host, download {PlatformNameShort}, and configure the inventory file, run the `install` playbook to install containerized {PlatformNameShort}.

.Prerequisites

You have done the following:

* xref:preparing-the-rhel-host-for-containerized-installation[Prepared the {RHEL} host]
* xref:downloading-containerized-aap[Downloaded {PlatformNameShort}]
* xref:configuring-inventory-file[Configured the inventory file]

.Procedure

* Run the `install` playbook:
----
ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file_name> ansible.containerized_installer.install
----

For example:
----
ansible-playbook -i inventory ansible.containerized_installer.install
----

You can add additional parameters to the installation command as needed:
----
ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file_name> -e @<vault_file_name> --ask-vault-pass -K -v ansible.containerized_installer.install
----

For example:
----
ansible-playbook -i inventory -e @vault.yml --ask-vault-pass -K -v  ansible.containerized_installer.install
----

* `-i <inventory_file_name>` - The inventory file to use for the installation.
* `-e @<vault_file_name> --ask-vault-pass` - (Optional) If you are using a vault to store sensitive variables, add this to the installation command.
* `-K` - (Optional) If your privilege escalation requires you to enter a password, add this to the installation command. You are then prompted for the BECOME password.
* `-v` - (Optional) You can use increasing verbosity, up to 4 vâ€™s (`-vvvv`) to see the details of the installation process. However, it is important to note that this can significantly increase installation time, so use it only as needed or requested by Red Hat support.

The installation of containerized {PlatformNameShort} begins.
