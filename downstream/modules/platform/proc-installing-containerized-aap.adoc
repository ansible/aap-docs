= Installing containerized {PlatformNameShort}

[role="_abstract"]
Run the `install` playbook to install containerized {PlatformNameShort} after preparing the {RHEL} host, downloading the installation program, and configuring the inventory file.

.Prerequisites

* You have link:{URLContainerizedInstall}/preparing-containerized-installation#preparing-the-rhel-host-for-containerized-installation[prepared the {RHEL} host]
* You have link:{URLContainerizedInstall}/preparing-containerized-installation#preparing-the-managed-nodes-for-containerized-installation[prepared the managed nodes]
* You have link:{URLContainerizedInstall}/preparing-containerized-installation#downloading-ansible-automation-platform[downloaded {PlatformNameShort}]
* You have link:{URLContainerizedInstall}/preparing-containerized-installation#configuring-inventory-file[configured the inventory file]
* You are logged in to the {RHEL} host as your non-root user

.Procedure

. Go to the installation directory on your {RHEL} host.
. Run the `install` playbook:
+
----
ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file_name> ansible.containerized_installer.install
----
+
For example:
+
----
ansible-playbook -i inventory ansible.containerized_installer.install
----
+
You can add additional parameters to the installation command as needed:
+
----
ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file_name> -e @<vault_file_name> --ask-vault-pass -K -v ansible.containerized_installer.install
----
+
For example:
+
----
ansible-playbook -i inventory -e @vault.yml --ask-vault-pass -K -v  ansible.containerized_installer.install
----

** `-i <inventory_file_name>` - The inventory file to use for the installation.
** `-e @<vault_file_name> --ask-vault-pass` - (Optional) If you are using a vault to store sensitive variables, add this to the installation command.
** `-K` - (Optional) If your privilege escalation (becoming root) requires you to enter a password, add this to the installation command. You are then prompted for the BECOME password.
** `-v` - (Optional) You can use increasing verbosity, up to 4 (`-vvvv`) to see installation process details. This can significantly increase installation time. Use it only as needed or when requested by Red Hat support.

.Verification

* After the installation completes, verify that you can access {PlatformNameShort} which is available by default at the following URL:
+
----
https://<gateway_node>:443
----
+
* Log in as the admin user with the credentials you created for `gateway_admin_username` and `gateway_admin_password`.
+
* The default ports and protocols used for {PlatformNameShort} are 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). You can customize the ports with the following variables:
+
----
envoy_http_port=80
envoy_https_port=443
----
+
* If you want to disable HTTPS, set `envoy_disable_https` to `true`:
+
----
envoy_disable_https: true
----
