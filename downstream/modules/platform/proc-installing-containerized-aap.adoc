= Installing containerized {PlatformNameShort}

[role="_abstract"]

You can control the installation of {PlatformNameShort} with inventory files. Inventory files define the hosts and containers used and created, variables for components, and other information needed to customize the installation.

Example inventory files are provided in this document that you can copy and change to quickly get started. 

Inventory files for the growth and enterprise topologies are also found in the downloaded installer package:

* The default one named `inventory` is for the enterprise topology pattern. 

* If you want to deploy the growth or all-in-one pattern you need to copy over or use the `inventory-growth` file instead.

Additionally, you can find example inventory files in link:{URLTopologies}/container-topologies[Container topologies] in _{TitleTopologies}_.

To use the example inventory files, replace the `< >` placeholders with your specific variables, and update the host names. Refer to the `README.md` file in the installation directory for more information about optional and required variables.

== Inventory file for online installation for containerized growth topology (all-in-one)

Use the example inventory file to perform an online installation for the containerized growth topology (all-in-one):

include::snippets/inventory-cont-a-env-a.adoc[]

[WARNING]
====
include::snippets/known-issue-container-content-syncing.adoc[]

== Inventory file for online installation for containerized enterprise topology

Use the example inventory file to perform an online installation for the containerized enterprise topology:

include::snippets/inventory-cont-b-env-a.adoc[]

.Redis configuration for an enterprise topology
* Redis can be colocated with any other node in a clustered installation.

* By default the `redis_mode` is set to `cluster`.
** `redis_mode=cluster`

* For more information about Redis, see link:{URLPlanningGuide}/ha-redis_planning[Caching and queueing system] in _{TitlePlanningGuide}_.

== Additional information for configuring your inventory file

.Offline or bundled installation

* To perform an offline installation, add the following under the `[all:vars]` group:

----
bundle_install=true
# The bundle directory must include /bundle in the path
bundle_dir=<full path to the bundle directory>
----

.Configuring a HAProxy load balancer

* To configure a HAProxy load balancer in front of {Gateway} with a custom CA cert, set the following inventory file variables under the `[all:vars]` group:

----
custom_ca_cert=<path_to_cert_crt>
gateway_main_url=<https://load_balancer_url>
----

[NOTE] 
====
HAProxy SSL passthrough mode is not supported with {Gateway}.
====

.Configuring shared storage for {HubName}

Shared storage is required when installing more than one instance of {HubName} with a `file` storage backend. When installing a single instance of the {HubName}, shared storage is optional.

* To configure shared storage for {HubName}, set the following variable in the inventory file, ensuring your network file system (NFS) share has read, write, and execute permissions:

----
hub_shared_data_path=<path_to_nfs_share>
----

* To change the mount options for your NFS share, use the `hub_shared_data_mount_opts` variable. This variable is optional and the default value is `rw,sync,hard`.


.Loading an {ControllerName} license file

* To define the location of your {ControllerName} license file, set the following variable in the inventory file:

----
controller_license_file=<full_path_to_your_manifest_zip_file>
----

//* To define the license file as part of the postinstall process instead, see xref:using-postinstall_{context}[Using the postinstall feature of containerized {PlatformNameShort}].


== Running the installation command

Use the following command to install containerized {PlatformNameShort}:

----
ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file_name> ansible.containerized_installer.install
----

For example:
----
ansible-playbook -i inventory ansible.containerized_installer.install
----

* If your privilege escalation requires you to enter a password, append `-K` to the command. You are then prompted for the `BECOME` password. 
* You can use increasing verbosity, up to 4 v's (`-vvvv`) to see the details of the installation process. However, it is important to note that this can significantly increase installation time, so it is recommended that you use it only as needed or requested by Red{nbsp}Hat support.
