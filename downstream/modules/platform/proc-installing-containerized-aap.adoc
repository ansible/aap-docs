= Installing containerized {PlatformNameShort}

Use the following command to install containerized {PlatformNameShort}:

----
ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file_name> ansible.containerized_installer.install
----

* If your privilege escalation requires you to enter a password, append `-K` to the command. You are then prompted for the `BECOME` password. 
* You can use increasing verbosity, up to 4 v's (`-vvvv`) to see the details of the installation process. However, it is important to note that this can significantly increase installation time, so it is recommended that you use it only as needed or requested by Red{nbsp}Hat support.
