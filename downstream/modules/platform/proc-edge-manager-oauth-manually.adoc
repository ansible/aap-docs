= Set up the OAuth application manually

[role="_abstract"]

Manually set up an OAuth application within your {PlatformNameShort} instance. 
This is important for enabling token-based authentication and integrating external applications such as the {RedHatEdge}.

.Procedure

. From the navigation panel on your {PlatformNameShort} instance, go to menu:{MenuAM}[OAuth Applications].
. Click btn:[Create OAuth application].
. Enter the following details:
** *Name*: Enter a name such as "Red Hat Edge Manager".
This is the name visible in the {PlatformNameShort} UI.
** *URL*: The `baseDomain` of your {RedHatEdge} UI with `https://`.
** *Organization*: Select *Default*.
** *Authorization grant type*: Select *Authorization code*.
** *Client*: Select *Public*.
** *Redirect URIs*: 
*** The redirect configured for your UI is your `baseDomain` with a /callback route appended, such as `https://your-edge-manager-ip-or-domain:443/callback`.
If you have more than one URI, enter them in this field separated by a space, not commas or other delimiters.
*** To provide a redirect for CLI usage (`flightctl login`), configure a redirect URI, such as `http://127.0.0.1/callback`.
. Click btn:[Create OAuth application].
An *Application Links* section is now visible in the navigation panel.
. Copy the *Client ID* as you need it to update the *oAuthApplicationClientId* in your `service-config.yaml` file with this value.
. Go to the link:{URLEdgeManager}/assembly-edge-manager-install#edge-manager-integrate-aap[Integrating with {PlatformNameShort}] section for the steps to edit your `service-config.yaml` file and complete setting up the OAuth application manually.
