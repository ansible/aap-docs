= Clustered Redis

[role="_abstract"]
Clustered Redis delivers high availability and scalability for {PlatformNameShort} by distributing data across many nodes with automatic failover capabilities. 
Use clustered Redis when you need enterprise-grade resilience, data scalability, and protection against node failures in production environments.

Clustered Redis, shared between the {Gateway} and {EDAName}, is the default configuration when installing {PlatformNameShort} in containerized and Operator-based deployments.

[NOTE]
====
A Redis high availability (HA) compatible deployment require 6 VMs. 
In RPM deployments, Redis can be colocated on each {PlatformNameShort} component VM except for {ControllerName}, execution nodes, or the PostgreSQL database.
In containerized deployments, Redis can be colocated on any {PlatformNameShort} component VMs of your choice except for execution nodes or the PostgreSQL database.
See {LinkTopologies} for the opinionated deployment options available. 
====

A cluster has three primary nodes and each primary node has a replica node.

If a primary instance becomes unavailable due to failures, the other primary nodes will initiate a failover state to promote a replica node to a primary node.

The benefits of deploying clustered Redis over standalone Redis include the following:

* Data is automatically split across many nodes.
* Data can be dynamically adjusted.
* Automatic failover of the primary nodes initiates during system failures.

For more information about scalability with Redis, see link:https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling/[Scale with Redis Cluster] in the Redis product documentation.

For more information about deploying {PlatformNameShort} with clustered Redis, see the {LinkInstallationGuide}, {LinkContainerizedInstall}, and {LinkOperatorInstallation} guides.
