= Clustered Redis

With clustered Redis, data is automatically partitioned over multiple nodes to provide performance stability and nodes are assigned as replicas to provide reliability. Clustered Redis, shared between the {Gateway} and {EDAName}, is provided by default when installing {PlatformNameShort} in containerized and operator-based deployments.

[NOTE]
====
6 VMs are required for a Redis high availability (HA) compatible deployment. In RPM deployments, Redis can be colocated on each {PlatformNameShort} component VM except for {ControllerName}, execution nodes, or the PostgreSQL database. In containerized deployments, Redis can be colocated on any {PlatformNameShort} component VMs of your choice except for execution nodes or the PostgreSQL database. See link:{LinkTopologies} for the opinionated deployment options available. 
====

A cluster contains three primary nodes and each primary node contains a replica node.

If a primary instance becomes unavailable due to failures, the other primary nodes will initiate a failover state to promote a replica node to a primary node.

The benefits of deploying clustered Redis over standalone Redis include the following:

* Data is automatically split across multiple nodes.
* Data can be dynamically adjusted.
* Automatic failover of the primary nodes is initiated during system failures.

Therefore, if you need data scalability and automatic failover, deploy {PlatformNameShort} with a clustered Redis. For more information about scalability with Redis, refer to link:https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling/[Scale with Redis Cluster] in the Redis product documentation.

For information on deploying {PlatformNameShort} with clustered Redis, refer to the link:{LinkInstallationGuide}, link:{LinkContainerizedInstall}, and link:{LinkOperatorInstallation} guides.
