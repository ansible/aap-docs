= Clustered Redis

With clustered Redis, data is automatically partitioned over multiple nodes to provide performance stability and nodes are assigned as replicas to provide reliability. Clustered Redis shared between the platform gateway and {EDAName} is provided by default when installing {PlatformNameShort} in containerized and operator-based deployments.

A cluster contains three primary nodes and each primary node contains a replica node.

If a primary instance becomes unavailable due to failures, the other primary nodes will initiate a failover state to promote a replica node to a primary node.

The benefits of deploying clustered Redis over standalone Redis include the following:

* Data is automatically split across multiple nodes.
* Data can be dynamically adjusted.
* Automatic failover of the primary nodes is initiated during system failures.

Therefore, if you need data scalability and automatic failover, deploy {PlatformNameShort} with a clustered Redis. For more information about scalability with Redis, refer to link:https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling/[Scale with Redis Cluster] in the Redis product documentation.

For information on deploying {PlatformNameShort} with clustered Redis, refer to the {BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/rpm_installation[{TitleInstallationGuide}] guide, the link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/containerized_installation[{TitleContainerizedInstall}] guide, or the link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/installing_on_openshift_container_platform[{TitleOperatorInstallation}] guide.
