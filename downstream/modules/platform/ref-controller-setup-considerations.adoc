= Setup considerations

Learn about the initial setup of clusters. 
To upgrade an existing cluster, see link:https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/4.4/html/upgrade-migration-guide/upgrade_considerations.html#upgrade-planning[Upgrade Planning] in the _{PlatformNameShort} Upgrade and Migration Guide_.

Note the following important considerations in the new clustering environment:

* PostgreSQL is  a standalone instance and is not clustered. 
{ControllerNameStart} does not manage replica configuration or database failover (if the user configures standby replicas).
* When you start a cluster, the database node must be a standalone server, and PostgreSQL must not be installed on one of the {ControllerName} nodes.
* PgBouncer is not recommended for connection pooling with {ControllerName}. 
{ControllerNameStart} relies on `pg_notify` for sending messages across various components, and therefore, `PgBouncer` cannot readily be used in transaction pooling mode.
* All instances must be reachable from all other instances and they must be able to reach the database. 
It is also important for the hosts to have a stable address or hostname (depending on how the {ControllerName} host is configured).
* All instances must be geographically collocated, with reliable low-latency connections between instances.
* To upgrade to a clustered environment, your primary instance must be part of the `default` group in the inventory and it needs to be the first host listed in the `default` group.
* Manual projects must be manually synced to all instances by the customer, and updated on all instances at once.
* The `inventory` file for platform deployments should be saved or persisted. 
If new instances are to be provisioned, the passwords, configuration options, and host names, must be made available to installation program.
