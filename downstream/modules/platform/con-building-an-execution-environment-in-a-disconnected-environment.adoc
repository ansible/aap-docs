Creating execution environments for {PlatformNameShort} is a common task which works differently in disconnected environments. When building a custom {ExecEnvShort}, the ansible-builder tool defaults to downloading content from the following locations on the internet:

* Red Hat {HubNameStart} ({Console}) or {Galaxy} (galaxy.ansible.com) for any Ansible content collections added to the {ExecEnvShort} image.

* PyPI (pypi.org) for any python packages required as collection dependencies.

* RPM repositories such as the RHEL or UBI repositories (cdn.redhat.com) for adding or updating RPMs to the {ExecEnvShort} image, if needed. 

* `registry.redhat.io` for access to the base container images.

Building an {ExecEnvShort} image in a disconnected environment requires mirroring content from these locations.
For information about importing collections from {Galaxy} or {HubName} into a {PrivateHubName}, see link:{URLHubManagingContent}/managing-collections-hub#proc-import-collection[Importing an automation content collection in {HubName}] .

Mirrored PyPI content once transferred into the disconnected network can be made available by using a web server or an artifact repository such as Nexus. The RHEL and UBI repository content can be exported from an internet-facing Red Hat Satellite Server, copied into the disconnected environment, then imported into a disconnected Satellite so it is available for building custom {ExecEnvShort}s. See link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_satellite/{SatelliteVers}/html-single/installing_satellite_server_in_a_disconnected_network_environment/index#iss_export_sync_in_an_air_gapped_scenario[ISS Export Sync in an Air-Gapped Scenario] for details.

The default base container image, `ee-minimal-rhel8`, is used to create custom {ExecEnvShort} images and is included with the bundled installer. 
This image is added to the {PrivateHubName} at install time. 

If a different base container image such as `ee-minimal-rhel9` is required, it must be imported to the disconnected network and added to the {PrivateHubName} container registry.

Once all of the prerequisites are available on the disconnected network, the ansible-builder command can be used to create custom {ExecEnvShort} images.
