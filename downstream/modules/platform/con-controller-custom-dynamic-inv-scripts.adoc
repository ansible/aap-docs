= Custom Dynamic Inventory Scripts

A custom dynamic inventory script stored in version control can be imported and run. 
This makes it much easier to make changes to an inventory script.
Rather than having to copy and paste a script into {ControllerName}, it is pulled directly from source control and then executed.
The script must handle any credentials required for its task. 
You are responsible for installing any Python libraries required by the script. 
(Custom dynamic inventory scripts have the same requirement.) 
This applies to both user-defined inventory source scripts and SCM sources as they are both exposed to Ansible _virtualenv_ requirements related to playbooks.

You can specify environment variables when you edit the SCM inventory source. 
For some scripts, this is sufficient. 
However, this is not a secure way to store secret information that gives access to cloud providers or inventory.

A better way is to create a new credential type for the inventory script you are going to use. 
The credential type must specify all the necessary types of inputs. 
Then, when you create a credential of this type, the secrets are stored in an encrypted form. 
If you apply that credential to the inventory source, the script has access to those inputs.

For more information, see [Credential types] in the {ControllerUG}.
