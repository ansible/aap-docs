= Cloud and autoscaling flexibility

[role="_abstract"]
{ControllerNameStart} includes a powerful optional provisioning callback feature that enables nodes to request configuration on-demand.

This is an ideal solution for a cloud auto-scaling scenario and includes the following features:

* It integrates with provisioning servers such as Cobbler and deals with managed systems with unpredictable uptimes.
* It requires no management software to be installed on remote nodes.
* The callback solution can be triggered by a call to `curl` or `wget`, and can be embedded in `init` scripts, kickstarts, or preseeds.
* You can control access so that only machines listed in the inventory can request configuration.
