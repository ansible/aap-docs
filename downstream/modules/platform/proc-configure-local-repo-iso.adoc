= Configure a local repository from a mounted ISO

[role="_abstract"]
You can use a {RHEL} Binary DVD image to access the necessary RPM source dependencies in a disconnected environment.

.Prerequisites
* You have downloaded the {RHEL} Binary DVD image from the link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/rhel[{RHEL} downloads page] and moved it to your disconnected environment.

.Procedure
. In your disconnected environment, create a mount point directory to serve as the location for the ISO file:
+
----
$ sudo mkdir /media/rhel
----

. Mount the ISO image to the mount point. Replace `<version_number>` and `<arch_name>` with suitable values:
+
----
$ sudo mount -o loop rhel-<version_number>-<arch_name>-dvd.iso /media/rhel
----
** Note: The ISO is mounted in a read-only state.

. Create a Yum repository file at `/etc/yum.repos.d/rhel.repo` with the following content:
+
----
[RHEL-BaseOS]
name=Red Hat Enterprise Linux BaseOS
baseurl=file:///media/rhel/BaseOS
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release

[RHEL-AppStream]
name=Red Hat Enterprise Linux AppStream
baseurl=file:///media/rhel/AppStream
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release
----

. Import the gpg key to allow the system to verify the packages:
+
----
$ sudo rpm --import /media/rhel/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release
----

. Verify the repository configuration:
+
----
$ sudo yum repolist
----
