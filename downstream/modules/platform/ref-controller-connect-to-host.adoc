= Unable to connect to your host

If you are unable to run the `helloworld.yml` example playbook from the link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html-single/getting_started_with_automation_controller/index#controller-projects[Managing projects] section of the _{ControllerGS}_ guide or other playbooks due to host connection errors, try the following:

* Can you `ssh` to your host? 
Ansible depends on SSH access to the servers you are managing.
* Are your `hostnames` and IPs correctly added in your inventory file?
Check for typos.
