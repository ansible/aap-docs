= {Galaxy} integration

[role="_abstract"]
{ControllerNameStart} integrates with {Galaxy} to simplify the process of using and managing Ansible roles in your automation projects.

By including an {Galaxy} `requirements.yml` file in your project directory, {ControllerName} automatically fetches the roles your playbook needs from Galaxy, GitHub, or your local source control.
