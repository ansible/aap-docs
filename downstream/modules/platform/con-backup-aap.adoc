= Back up your {PlatformNameShort} instance

Back up an existing {PlatformNameShort} instance by running the `.setup.sh` script with the `backup_dir` flag, which saves the content and configuration of your current environment.

.Procedure

. Navigate to your {PlatformNameShort} installation directory.
. Run the `./setup.sh` script following the example below:
+
----
$ ./setup.sh -e ‘backup_dir=/ansible/mybackup’ -e ‘use_compression=True’ @credentials.yml -b <1>
----
<1> `backup_dir` specifies a directory to save your backup to.

With a successful backup, a backup file is created at `/ansible/mybackup/automation-platform-backup-<date/time>.tar.gz` .
