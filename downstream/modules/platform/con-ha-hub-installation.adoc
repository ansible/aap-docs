= High availability {HubName}

[role="_abstract"]
Configure inventory files to deploy high availability {HubName} with clustered nodes, database hosts, and load balancing for enterprise-scale automation.

Use the following examples to populate the inventory file to install a highly available {HubName}. This inventory file includes a highly available {HubName} with a clustered setup.

//dcdacosta - include a link to the RHSSO content once it's added.
You can configure your HA deployment further to enable a xref:proc-install-ha-hub-selinux[high availability deployment of {HubName} on SELinux].

*Specify database host IP*

* Specify the IP address for your database host, using the `automation_pg_host` and `automation_pg_port` inventory variables. For example:

-----
automationhub_pg_host='192.0.2.10'
automationhub_pg_port=5432
-----

* Also specify the IP address for your database host in the [database] section, using the value in the `automationhub_pg_host` inventory variable:
-----
[database]
192.0.2.10
-----

*List all instances in a clustered setup*

* If installing a clustered setup, replace `localhost ansible_connection=local` in the `[automationhub]` section with the hostname or IP of all instances. For example:
-----
[automationhub]
automationhub1.testing.ansible.com ansible_user=cloud-user
automationhub2.testing.ansible.com ansible_user=cloud-user
automationhub3.testing.ansible.com ansible_user=cloud-user
-----

*Next steps*

Check that the following directives are present in `/etc/pulp/settings.py` in each of the {PrivateHubName} servers:
----
USE_X_FORWARDED_PORT = True
USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST = True
----

[NOTE]
====
If you are using a load balancer, configure `automationgateway_main_url` to point to your load balancer. If `automationgateway_main_url` is not specified, the first node in the [automationgateway] group will be used as default.
