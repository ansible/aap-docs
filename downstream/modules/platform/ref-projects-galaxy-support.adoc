= {Galaxy} support

At the end of a Project update, {ControllerName} searches for the `requirements.yml` file in the `roles` directory, located at
`<project-top-level-directory>/roles/requirements.yml`. 

If this file is found, the following command automatically runs:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
ansible-galaxy role install -r roles/requirements.yml -p <project-specific cache location>/requirements_roles -vvv
----

This file enables you to reference {Galaxy} roles or roles within other repositories which can be checked out in conjunction with your own
project. 
The addition of {Galaxy} support eliminates the need to create git submodules to achieve this result. 
Given that SCM projects, along with roles or collections, are pulled into and executed from a private job environment, a `<private job directory>` specific to the project within `/tmp` is created by default. 
However, you can specify another *Job Execution Path* based on your environment in the *Jobs Settings* tab of the *Settings* window:

The cache directory is a subdirectory inside the global projects folder.
The content can be copied from the cache location to `<job private directory>/requirements_roles`.

By default, {ControllerName} has a system-wide setting that enables you to dynamically download roles from the `roles/requirements.yml` file for SCM projects. 
You can turn off this setting in the *Jobs settings* screen of the *Settings* menu by switching the *Enable Role Download* toggle button
to *OFF*.

Whenever a project synchronization runs, {ControllerName} determines if the project source and any roles from Galaxy or Collections are out of date with the project.
Project updates download the roles inside the update.

If jobs need to pick up a change made to an upstream role, updating the project ensures that this happens. 
A change to the role means that a new commit was pushed to the _provision-role_ source control. 

To make this change take effect in a job, you do not have to push a new commit to the _playbooks_ repo, but you must update the project, which downloads roles to a local cache. 

For instance, say you have two git repositories in source control. 
The first one is _playbooks_ and the project in {ControllerName} points to this URL. 
The second one is _provision-role_ and it is referenced by the `roles/requirements.yml` file inside of the _playbooks_ git repo.

Jobs download the most recent roles before every job run. 
Roles and collections are locally cached for performance reasons, and you must select *Update Revision on Launch* in the project *SCM Update Options* to ensure that the upstream role is re-downloaded before each job run:

The update happens much earlier in the process than the sync, so this identifies errors and details faster and in a more logical location.

For more information and examples on the syntax of the `requirements.yml` file, see the link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/galaxy/user_guide.html#installing-multiple-roles-from-a-file[role requirements section] in the Ansible documentation.

If there are any directories that must be specifically be exposed, you can specify those in the *Jobs* section of the *Settings* screen in *Paths to Expose to Isolated Jobs* or by updating the following entry in the settings file:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
AWX_ISOLATION_SHOW_PATHS = ['/list/of/', '/paths']
----

[NOTE]
====
If your playbooks need to use keys or settings defined in `AWX_ISOLATION_SHOW_PATHS`, you must add `AWX_ISOLATION_SHOW_PATHS` to `/var/lib/awx/.ssh`.
====

If you made changes in the settings file, be sure to restart services with the `automation-controller-service restart` command after your
changes have been saved.

In the UI, you can configure these settings in the *Jobs settings* window.
