= Example capacity planning exercise

After you have determined the workload capacity that you want to support, you must plan your deployment based on the requirements of the workload. To help you with your deployment, review the following planning exercise.

For this example, the cluster must support the following capacity:

* 300 managed hosts
* 1,000 tasks per hour per host or 16 tasks per minute per host
* 10 concurrent jobs
* Forks set to 5 on playbooks. This is the default.
* Average event size is 1 Mb

The virtual machines have 4 CPU and 16 GB RAM, and disks that have 3000 IOPs.

|===
| Node | API capacity | Default execution capacity | Default control capacity | Mean event processing rate at 100% capacity usage | Mean events
processing rate at 50% capacity usage | Mean event processing rate at 40% capacity usage
| 4 CPU at 2.5Ghz, 16 GB RAM control node, a maximum of 3000 IOPs disk | approximately 10 requests per second | n/a | 137 jobs | 1100 per second | 1400 per second | 1630 per second
| 4 CPU at 2.5Ghz, 16 GB RAM execution node, a maximum of 3000 IOPs disk | n/a | 137 | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a
| 4 CPU at 2.5Ghz, 16 GB RAM database node, a maximum of 3000 IOPs disk | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a
|===

Because controlling jobs competes with job event processing on the control node, over-provisioning control capacity can reduce processing times. When processing times are high, you can experience a delay between when the job runs and when you can view the output in the API or UI.

For this example, for a workload on 300 managed hosts, executing 1000 tasks per hour per host, 10 concurrent jobs with forks set to 5 on playbooks, and an average event size 1 Mb, use the following procedure:

* Deploy 1 execution node, 1 control node, 1 database node of 4 CPU at 2.5Ghz, 16 GB RAM, and disks that have approximately 3000 IOPs.
* Keep the default fork setting of 5 on job templates.
* Use the capacity adjustment feature in the instance view of the UI on the control node to reduce the capacity down to 16, the lowest value, to reserve more of the control node's capacity for processing events.
