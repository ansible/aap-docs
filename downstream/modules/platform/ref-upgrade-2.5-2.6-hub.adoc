Understand identity changes for {HubName} users when upgrading from 2.5 to {PlatformVers}. 
Review automatically merged teams, manually reassign permissions for removed admins, and reconfigure SSO to restore user access.

The following apply:

* A {PrivateHubName} admin (Automation Content Administrator) in 2.5 will be removed in the upgraded version and for this user the permissions must be reassigned manually as part of the data movement process. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
If teams with the same name exist in both {HubName} and within the platform-wide authentication gateway, users from {HubName} will be automatically added to corresponding teams within the platform-wide authentication gateway, and new teams will be created if they do not exist. 
This approach aims to retain team memberships, but requires careful review of permissions post-upgrade.
====

* If you rely on {HubName} _Single Sign-On_ (SSO) to access the {HubName} user interface (UI), {HubName} SSO logins will no longer function after the upgrade. 
However, API tokens will remain active. 
Therefore, automated processes or systems that use API tokens for authentication will continue to operate without interruption. 
If your workflows predominantly rely on API access, the impact might be minimal. 
However, if users primarily access the UI through SSO, they will need to take action post-upgrade.

* To restore UI access for users who previously relied on automation hub SSO, you need to reconfigure SSO within {PlatformNameShort} to be able to login.

* {ControllerNameStart} admins will become platform admins and can administer {HubName}.

* If you upgraded from 2.4 to {PlatformVers} with both {ControllerName} and {PrivateHubName}, then a dialog is displayed in the product post upgrade that informs you that there are steps to take to reconfigure {PrivateHubName}. 
This dialog can either display information in-product, or link to a product doc or Knowledge Base article. In either case, you will be guided to take action from within the product and not be expected to find that information unprompted.

* If you upgraded from 2.4 to {PlatformVers} from an {ControllerName}-only environment, then the addition of {PrivateHubName} and {EDAName} services involves adding the necessary roles to a normal user account to grant access to those services.
