After the installation completes, the default protocol and ports used for platform gateway are 80 (http) and 443 (https).

You can customize the ports with the following variables:

----
gateway_nginx_http_port: 8500

gateway_nginx_https_port: 8501
----

If you want to disable https, set `gateway_nginx_disable_https` to `true`:

----
gateway_nginx_disable_https: true
----

[NOTE]
====
Consult the *README.md* for further details. Leave the defaults unless you need to change them due to port conflicts or other factors.
