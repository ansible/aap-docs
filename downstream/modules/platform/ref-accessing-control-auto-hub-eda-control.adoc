Write a short introductory paragraph that provides an overview of the module.

Accessing controller, automation hub, and EDA controller

Once the installation completes, these are the default protocol and ports used:

* https protocol

* Port 443 for controller

* Port 444 for automation hub

* Port 445 for EDA controller

These can be changed. Consult the README.md for further details. We recommend leaving the defaults unless you need to change them due to port conflicts or other factors.
