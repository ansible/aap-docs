= Revoking partial administrator role in {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers}

When the System Administrator (`is_superuser`) role is revoked through authentication mappings for any authentication method in {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers}, the revocation does not fully cascade.

The user loses the {Gateway} *System Administrator* role but keeps the following component administrator roles:

* *Automation Execution Administrator* ({ControllerNameStart})
* *Automation Decision Administrator* ({EDAName})
* *Automation Content Administrator* ({HubName})

This issue occurs only when external authentication providers trigger the token revocation. 
Manual revocation initiated by a user within the {Gateway} UI works correctly.
This behavior is updated in {PlatformNameShort} 2.6 to ensure the System Administrator value is honored across all components regardless of how it is revoked.

To fully remove all administrative privileges after a mapped authentication revocation, a local administrator must perform the following manual steps:

.Procedure
. Log in to {Gateway} with a System Administrator account.
. From the navigation panel, select {MenuControllerUsers} and click the required user.
. In the *Roles* tab, remove the following retained roles: *Automation Execution Administrator*, *Automation Decision Administrator*, and *Automation Content Administrator*.
