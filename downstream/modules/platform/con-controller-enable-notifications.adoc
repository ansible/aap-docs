= Enable and disable notifications

You can set up notifications to notify you when a specific job starts, as well as on the success or failure at the end of the job run. 
Note the following behaviors:

* If a workflow job template has notification on start enabled, and a job template within that workflow also has notification on start enabled, you receive notifications for both.
* You can enable notifications to run on many job templates within a workflow job template.
* You can enable notifications to run on a sliced job template start and each slice generates a notification.
* When you enable a notification to run on job start, and that notification gets deleted, the job template continues to run, but results in an error message.

You can enable notifications on job start, job success, and job failure, or a combination of these, from the *Notifications* tab of the *Details* page for the following resources:

* Job Templates
* Workflow Templates
* Projects
//* Inventory Sources Can't confirm this

For workflow templates that have approval nodes, in addition to *Start*, *Success*, and *Failure*, you can enable or disable certain approval-related events:
