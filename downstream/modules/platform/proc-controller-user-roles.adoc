= Assign roles to a user

[role="_abstract"]

You can grant users granular access to specific resources such as inventories, projects, or job templates by assigning users roles.

You can view and manage roles that were assigned directly to a user by an administrator in the user's *Roles* tab.

You can view roles that a user inherited from a team assignment in the *View indirectly assigned roles* link in the page banner. 
You cannot directly manage an indirectly-assigned role. You can only manage indirectly-assigned roles by link:{URLCentralAuth}/gw-managing-access#proc-controller-user-permissions[editing the team's role assignments], or by link:{URLCentralAuth}/gw-managing-access#proc-gw-team-remove-user[removing the user from the team]. 

[NOTE]
====
Users cannot be assigned to an organization through role assignment, nor can you assign users organization roles from this screen. Refer to the steps provided in link:{URLCentralAuth}/gw-managing-access#proc-controller-add-organization-user[Adding a user to an organization] for detailed instructions on assigning a user to an organization.
====

Roles are labeled with their associated {PlatformNameShort} component and function. These components align with {PlatformNameShort} services and the side navigation structure in the user interface. Component labels can be understood as follows: 

* *Automation Execution* refers to {ControllerName}
* *Automation Decisions* refers to {EDAName}
* *Automation Content* refers to {HubName}

When assigning roles, ensure that you are selecting the required resource in the correct component context, because resources such as projects and credentials can be associated with both Automation Execution and Automation Decisions.
