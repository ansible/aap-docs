= Multi-Vault Credentials

Because you can assign multiple credentials to a job, you can specify multiple Vault credentials to decrypt when your job template runs. 
This functionality mirrors the support for link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/vault_guide/vault_managing_passwords.html#[Managing vault passwords].

Vault credentials now have an optional field, `vault_id`, which is similar to the `--vault-id` argument of `ansible-playbook`. 

Use the following procedure to run a playbook which makes use of multiple vault passwords:

.Procedure
. Create a Vault credential in {ControllerName} for each vault password.
. Specify the Vault ID as a field on the credential and input the password (which is encrypted and stored).
. Assign multiple vault credentials to the job template using the new credentials endpoint:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
POST /api/v2/job_templates/N/credentials/

{
    'associate': true,
    'id': X
}
----

Alternatively, you can perform the same assignment in the {ControllerName} UI in the *Create Credential* page:

In this example, the credential created specifies the secret to be used by its Vault Identifier ("first") and password pair. 
When this credential is used in a Job Template, as in the following example, it only decrypts the secret associated with the "first" Vault ID:

If you have a playbook that is set up the traditional way with all the secrets in one big file without distinction, then leave the *Vault Identifier* field blank when setting up the Vault credential.
