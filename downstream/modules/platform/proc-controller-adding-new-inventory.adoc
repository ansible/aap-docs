= Add a new inventory

[role="_abstract"]
Adding a new inventory involves the following components:

* xref:proc-controller-adding-inv-permissions[Adding permissions to inventories]
* xref:proc-controller-add-groups[Adding groups to inventories]
* xref:proc-controller-add-hosts[Adding a host]
* xref:proc-controller-add-source[Adding a source]
* xref:ref-controller-view-completed-jobs[View completed jobs]

Use the following procedure to create a inventory:

.Procedure
. From the navigation panel, select {MenuInfrastructureInventories}.
The *Inventories* window displays a list of the inventories that are currently available.
. Click btn:[Create inventory], and select the type of inventory to create.
. Enter the appropriate details into the following fields:

* *Name*: Enter a name appropriate for this inventory.
* Optional: *Description*: Enter an arbitrary description as appropriate.
* *Organization*: Required. Choose among the available organizations.
* Only applicable to Smart Inventories: *Smart host filter*: Populate the hosts for this inventory by using a search filter. 
+
For example "name__icontains=RedHat".
+
These options are based on the organization you chose.
+
Filters are similar to tags in that tags are used to filter certain hosts that contain those names.
Therefore, to populate the *Smart host filter* field, specify a tag that has the hosts you want, not the hosts themselves.
+
Filters are case-sensitive.
* *Instance groups*: Select the instance group or groups for this inventory to run on.
+
You can select many instance groups and sort them in the order that you want them run.
+

* Optional: *Labels*: Supply labels that describe this inventory, so they can be used to group and filter inventories and jobs.
* Only applicable to constructed inventories: *Input inventories*: Specify the source inventories to include in this constructed inventory.
//Click the image:search.png[Search,15,15] icon to select from available inventories.
Empty groups from input inventories are copied into the constructed inventory.
* Optional:(Only applicable to constructed inventories): *Cached timeout (seconds)*: Set the length of time you want the cache plugin data to timeout.
* Only applicable to constructed inventories: *Verbosity*: Control the level of output that Ansible produces as the playbook executes related to inventory sources associated with constructed inventories.
+
Select the verbosity from:

* *Normal*
* *Verbose*
* *More verbose*
* *Debug*
* *Connection Debug* 
* *WinRM Debug* 

** *Verbose* logging includes the output of all commands.
** *More verbose* provides more detail than *Verbose*.
** *Debug* logging is exceedingly verbose and includes information about SSH operations that can be useful in certain support instances. Most users do not need to see debug mode output.
//Not sure of this
** *Connection Debug* enables you to run SSH in verbose mode, providing debugging information about the SSH connection progress.
//Not sure of this. 
** *WinRM Debug* used for verbosity specific to windows remote management 
+
Click the image:arrow.png[Expand,15,15] icon for information on *How to use the constructed inventory plugin*.
* Only applicable to constructed inventories: *Limit*: Restricts the number of returned hosts for the inventory source associated with the constructed inventory.
You can paste a group name into the limit field to only include hosts in that group.
For more information, see the *Source vars* setting.
* Only applicable to standard inventories: *Options*: Check the *Prevent Instance Group Fallback* option to enable only the instance groups listed in the *Instance Groups* field to run the job.
If unchecked, all available instances in the execution pool are used based on the hierarchy described in
xref:controller-control-job-run[Control where a job runs].
//Click the image:question_circle.png[Help,15,15] icon for additional information.
+
//[NOTE]
//====
//Set the `prevent_instance_group_fallback` option for Smart Inventories through the API.
//====

* *Variables* (*Source vars* for constructed inventories):

** *Variables* Variable definitions and values to apply to all hosts in this inventory.
Enter variables by using either JSON or YAML syntax.
Use the radio button to toggle between the two.
** *Source vars* for constructed inventories creates groups, specifically under the `groups` key of the data.
It accepts Jinja2 template syntax, renders it for every host, makes a `true` or `false` evaluation, and includes the host in the group (from the key of the entry) if the result is `true`.
This is particularly useful because you can paste that group name into the limit field to only include hosts in that group.
//See Example 1 in xref:ref-controller-smart-host-filter[Smart host filters].
. Click btn:[Create inventory].

.Next steps
After saving the new inventory, you can proceed with configuring permissions, groups, hosts, sources, and view completed jobs, if applicable to the type of inventory.
