= Assigning users to a team

[role="_abstract"]

To assign a user to a team, the user must already have been created. For more information, see link:{URLCentralAuth}/gw-managing-access#proc-controller-creating-a-user[Creating a user]. 
Assigning a user to a team adds them as a member only. Use the *Roles* tab to assign a role that gives users on the team resource access.

// [[hherbly]This may need to be replaced with updated steps for 2.6.] The following tab selections are available when adding users to a team. When user accounts from {ControllerName} or {HubName} organizations have been migrated to {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 during the upgrade process, the *Automation Execution* and *Automation Content* tabs show content based on whether the users were added to those organizations prior to migration.  

// {PlatformNameShort}:: Reflects all users added to the organization at the platform level. From this tab, you can add users as organization members and, optionally provide specific organization level roles.

// Automation Execution:: Reflects users that were added directly to the {ControllerName} organization prior to an upgrade and migration. From this tab, you can only view existing memberships in {ControllerName} and remove those memberships but you can not add new memberships. New organization memberships must be added through the platform.

// Automation Content:: Reflects users that were added directly to the {HubName} organization prior to an upgrade and migration. From this tab, you can only view existing memberships in {HubName} and remove those memberships but you can not add new memberships. 

New user memberships to a team must be added at the platform level.
