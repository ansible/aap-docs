= Troubleshooting: Keeping your subscription in compliance

If you use Ansible in environments where node counts are frequently changing, such as CI environments or public cloud environments, it can be a challenge to keep track of node use.
{PlatformNameStart} automatically keeps count of node use to ensure they are counted accurately. 
Often, these instances are thought of as ephemeral, meaning they exist for some unit of time, for example, an hour, before being deleted.  

For more infornmation,see link:https://www.ansible.com/blog/subscription-and-host-metric-changes-in-ansible-automation-platform-2.4[Subscription and Host Metric Changes in Ansible Automation Platform 2.4].

This reference explains why you would want to delete hosts, for example, `ephemeral`, and explains what is and what is not a deleted host that reappears. 
This enables you to search on keywords such as `decommissioned` in addition to, 'how do I “decommission” a host?'.
The reference also describes what "going out of compliance" and "going back into compliance" "means to your subscription allowance.

Your subscription has two possible statuses:

* *Compliant*: Indicates that your subscription is appropriate for the number of hosts that you have automated within your subscription count. 
* *Out of compliance*: Indicates that you have exceeded the number of hosts in your subscription.

Compliance is computed as follows:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
managed > manifest_limit    =>  non-compliant
managed =< manifest_limit   =>  compliant
----

Where:
`managed` is the number of unique managed hosts without deletions, and
`manifest_limit` is the number of managed hosts in the subscription manifest.

Other important information displayed are:

* *Hosts automated*: Host count automated by the job, which consumes the license count.
* *Hosts imported*: Host count considering unique host names across all inventory sources (does not impact hosts remaining).
* *Hosts remaining*: Total host count minus hosts automated.
* *Hosts deleted*: Hosts that were deleted, freeing the license capacity.
* *Active hosts previously deleted*: Number of hosts now active that were previously deleted.

For demonstration purposes, suppose you have a subscription capacity of 10 hosts:

* Starting with 9 hosts, 2 hosts were added and 3 hosts were deleted, you now have 8 hosts (compliant).
* 3 hosts were automated again, now you have 11 hosts, which puts you over the subscription limit of 10 (non-compliant).
* If you were to delete hosts, be sure to refresh the subscription details to see the change in count and status.

Select btn:[Host Metrics] in the navigation panel to view the activity associated with hosts, such as those that have been automated and deleted. 
Each unique hostname is listed and sorted by the user's preference.

[NOTE]
====
A scheduled task automatically updates these values on a weekly basis and deletes jobs with hosts that were last automated more than a year ago.
====

Delete unnecessary hosts directly from the Host Metrics view by selecting the desired hosts and clicking btn:[Delete]. 
These are soft-deleted, meaning their records are not removed, but are not being used and thereby not counted towards your subscription.
