[id="controller-keep-subscription-in-compliance_{context}"]

= Keeping your subscription in compliance

Your subscription has two possible statuses:

* *Compliant*: Indicates that your subscription is appropriate for the number of hosts that you have automated within your subscription count.
* *Out of compliance*: Indicates that you have exceeded the number of hosts in your subscription.

Compliance is computed as follows:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
managed > manifest_limit    =>  non-compliant
managed =< manifest_limit   =>  compliant
----

Where:
`managed` is the number of unique managed hosts without deletions, and
`manifest_limit` is the number of managed hosts in the subscription manifest.

Other important information displayed are:

* *Hosts automated*: The number of hosts automated by the job, which consumes the license count.
* *Hosts imported*: The number of hosts considering unique host names across all inventory sources. This number does not impact hosts remaining.
* *Hosts remaining*: The number of hosts minus the number of hosts automated.
* *Hosts deleted*: The number of hosts that were deleted, freeing the license capacity.
* *Active hosts previously deleted*: The number of hosts now active that were previously deleted.

For example, if you have a subscription capacity of 10 hosts:

* Starting with 9 hosts, 2 hosts were added and 3 hosts were deleted, you now have 8 hosts (compliant).
* 3 hosts were automated again, now you have 11 hosts, which puts you over the subscription limit of 10 (non-compliant).
* If you delete hosts, refresh the subscription details to see the change in count and status.
