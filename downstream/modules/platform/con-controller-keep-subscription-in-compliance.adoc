= Troubleshooting: Keeping your subscription in compliance

Your subscription has two possible statuses:

* *Compliant*: Indicates that your subscription is appropriate for the number of hosts that you have automated within your subscription count. 
* *Out of compliance*: Indicates that you have exceeded the number of hosts in your subscription.

Compliance is computed as follows:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
managed > manifest_limit    =>  non-compliant
managed =< manifest_limit   =>  compliant
----

Where:
`managed` is the number of unique managed hosts without deletions, and
`manifest_limit` is the number of managed hosts in the subscription manifest.

Other important information displayed are:

* *Hosts automated*: Host count automated by the job, which consumes the license count.
* *Hosts imported*: Host count considering unique host names across all inventory sources (does not impact hosts remaining).
* *Hosts remaining*: Total host count minus hosts automated.
* *Hosts deleted*: Hosts that were deleted, freeing the license capacity.
* *Active hosts previously deleted*: Number of hosts now active that were previously deleted.

For demonstration purposes, suppose you have a subscription capacity of 10 hosts:

* Starting with 9 hosts, 2 hosts were added and 3 hosts were deleted, you now have 8 hosts (compliant).
* 3 hosts were automated again, now you have 11 hosts, which puts you over the subscription limit of 10 (non-compliant).
* If you were to delete hosts, be sure to refresh the subscription details to see the change in count and status.

Select btn:[Host Metrics] in the navigation panel to view the activity associated with hosts, such as those that have been automated and deleted. 
Each unique hostname is listed and sorted by the user's preference.

[NOTE]
====
A scheduled task automatically updates these values on a weekly basis and deletes jobs with hosts that were last automated more than a year ago.
====

Delete unnecessary hosts directly from the Host Metrics view by selecting the desired hosts and clicking btn:[Delete]. 
These are soft-deleted, meaning their records are not removed, but are not being used and thereby not counted towards your subscription.
