= Removing Instances

From the *Add Instances page*, you can add, remove or run health checks on your nodes.

[NOTE]
====
You must follow the procedures for installing RHEL packages for any additional nodes you create. 
If you peer this additional node to an existing hop node, you must also install the Install Bundle on each node.
====

Use the check boxes next to an instance to select it to remove it, or run a health check against it. 

[NOTE]
====
* If a node is removed using the UI, then the node is "removed" and  does not show a status. 
If you delete the VM of the node before it is removed in the UI, it will show an error.  
* You only need to reinstall the Install Bundle if the topology changes the communication pattern, that is, hop nodes change or you add nodes.
====

When a button is disabled, you do not have permission for that particular action. 
Contact your Administrator to grant you the required level of access. 

If you are able to remove an instance, you receive a prompt for confirmation.

[NOTE]
====
You can still remove an instance even if it is active and jobs are running on it. 
{ControllerNameStart} waits for jobs running on this node to complete before removing it.
