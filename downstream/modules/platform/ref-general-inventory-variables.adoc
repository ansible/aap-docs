[role="_abstract"]
General inventory file variables for {PlatformNameShort}.

[cols="25%,25%,30%,10%,10%",options="header"]
|===
| RPM variable name | Container variable name | Description | Required or optional | Default

| `aap_ca_cert_file`
|`ca_tls_cert`
| Path to the user-provided CA certificate file. When you specify this variable, the installation program automatically generates TLS certificates for each {PlatformNameShort} service signed by this CA. You do not need to define individual service certificate variables (such as `gateway_tls_cert`, `controller_tls_cert`, or `hub_tls_cert`).

This variable adds the CA certificate to the environment to ensure proper authentication and trust of the manually provided certificates. This variable is not needed when using `ca_tls_cert` and `ca_tls_key`, which automatically generate TLS certificates.

Not required for disconnected (bundled) installations where `bundle_install=true`.
endif::container-install[]
| RPM = Required if you need a password to access `registry_url`. Container = Required for online installations if `registry_auth=true`. Not required for disconnected installations.
| 

| `registry_url`

| `routable_hostname` 
| `routable_hostname` 
| Used if the machine running the installation program can only route to the target host through a specific URL. 
For example, if you use short names in your inventory, but the node running the installation program can only resolve that host by using a FQDN. If `routable_hostname` is not set, it defaults to `ansible_host`. 
If you do not set `ansible_host`, `inventory_hostname` is used as a last resort. This variable is used as a host variable for particular hosts and not under the `[all:vars]` section.
