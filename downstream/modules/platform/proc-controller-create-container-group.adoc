= Create a container group

[role="_abstract"]
You can create a `ContainerGroup` in {ControllerName} to run jobs in containers on an OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster.

A `ContainerGroup` is a type of `InstanceGroup` that has an associated credential you can use to connect to an OpenShift cluster.

.Prerequisites

* A namespace that you can launch into.
Every cluster has a "default" namespace, but you can use a specific namespace.
* A service account that has the roles that enable it to launch and manage pods in this namespace. 
For more information, see link:{URLControllerUserGuide}/controller-instance-and-container-groups#controller-create-service-account[Creating a service account in {OCPShort} or Kubernetes].
* If you are using {ExecEnvShort}s in a private registry, and have a container registry credential associated with them in {ControllerName}, the service account also needs the roles to get, create, and delete secrets in the namespace.
If you do not want to give these roles to the service account, you can pre-create the `ImagePullSecrets` and specify them on the pod spec for the `ContainerGroup`.
In this case, the {ExecEnvShort} must not have a container registry credential associated, or {ControllerName} attempts to create the secret for you in the namespace.
* A token associated with that service account.
An OpenShift or Kubernetes Bearer Token.
* A CA certificate associated with the cluster.

.Procedure

. From the navigation panel, select {MenuInfrastructureInstanceGroups}.
. Click btn:[Create group] and select *Create container group*.
. Enter a name for your new container group and select the credential you created before to associate it to the container group.
. Click btn:[Create container group].
. Check the *Customize pod spec* box and edit the *Pod spec override* to include the namespace and service account name that you used in the previous steps.
