= Custom resources

You can define custom resources for each primary installation workflows.

//[Jameria] Moved this topic from supported installation section to custom resources since that's what the cross-referenced topic links to in the appendix (Custom resources appendix)
== Modifying the number of simultaneous rulebook activations during or after {EDAcontroller} installation

* If you plan to install {EDAName} on {OCPShort} and modify the number of simultaneous rulebook activations, add the required `EDA_MAX_RUNNING_ACTIVATIONS` parameter to your custom resources. By default, {EDAcontroller} allows 12 activations per node to run simultaneously. For an example see the link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html-single/installing_on_openshift_container_platform/index#eda_max_running_activations_yml[eda-max-running-activations.yml] in the appendix section. 

[NOTE]
====
`EDA_MAX_RUNNING_ACTIVATIONS` for {OCPShort} is a global value since there is no concept of worker nodes when installing {EDAName} on {OCPShort}.
