{AWS} credentials consist of the AWS *Access Key* and *Secret Key*.

{ControllerNameStart} provides support for EC2 STS tokens, also known as _Identity and Access Management_ (IAM) STS credentials. 
_Security Token Service_ (STS) is a web service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS IAM users. 

[NOTE]
====
If the value of your tags in EC2 contain Booleans (`yes/no/true/false`), you must quote them.
====

[WARNING]
====
To use implicit IAM role credentials, do not attach AWS cloud credentials in {ControllerName} when relying on IAM roles to access the AWS API.

Attaching your AWS cloud credential to your job template forces the use of your AWS credentials, not your IAM role credentials.
