Amazon Web Services credentials consist of the AWS *Access Key* and *Secret Key*.

{ControllerNameStart} provides support for EC2 STS tokens (sometimes referred to as IAM STS credentials). 
_Security Token Service_ (STS) is a web service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS
Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. 

For more information on the IAM/EC2 STS Token, see link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html[Temporary security credentials in IAM].

[NOTE]
====
If the value of your tags in EC2 contain booleans (`yes/no/true/false`), you must remember to quote them.
====

[WARNING]
====
To use implicit IAM role credentials, do not attach AWS cloud credentials in {ControllerName} when relying on IAM roles to access the AWS API.
While it may seem to make sense to attach your AWS cloud credential to your job template, doing forces the use of your AWS credentials and will not "fall through" to use your IAM role credentials (this is due to the use of the boto library.)
