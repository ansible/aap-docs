= Inventory Plugins

Inventory updates use dynamically-generated YAML files which are parsed by their respective inventory plugin. 
In {Controllername} v4.4, you can provide the inventory plugin configuration directly to {ControllerName} using the inventory source `source_vars` for the following inventory sources:

* xref:ug_source_ec2[]
* xref:ug_source_gce[]
* xref:ug_source_azure[]
* xref:ug_source_vmvcenter[]
* xref:ug_source_satellite[]
* xref:ug_source_insights[]
* xref:ug_source_openstack[]
* xref:ug_source_rhv[]
* xref:ug_source_tower[]

Newly created configurations for inventory sources contain the default plugin configuration values. 
If you want your newly created inventory sources to match the output of a legacy source, you must apply a specific set of configuration values for that source. 
To ensure backward compatibility, {ControllerName} uses "templates" for each of these sources to force the output of inventory plugins into the legacy
format. 

For more information on sources and their respective templates, see xref:controller-inventory-templates[Supported inventory plugin templates].

`source_vars` that contain `plugin: foo.bar.baz` as a top-level key are replaced with the fully-qualified inventory plugin name at runtime based on the `InventorySource` source. 
For example, if ec2 is selected for the `InventorySource` then, at run-time, plugin is  set to `amazon.aws.aws_ec2`.
