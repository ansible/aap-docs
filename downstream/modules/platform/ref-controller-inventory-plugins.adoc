= Inventory Plugins

Inventory updates use dynamically-generated YAML files which are parsed by their inventory plugin. 
In {Controllername} v4.4, you can provide the inventory plugin configuration directly to {ControllerName} using the inventory source `source_vars` for the following inventory sources:

* xref:proc-controller-amazon-ec2[{AWS} EC2]
* xref:proc-controller-inv-source-gce[Google Compute Engine]
* xref:proc-controller-azure-resource-manager[{Azure} Resource Manager]
* xref:proc-controller-inv-source-vm-vcenter[VMware vCenter]
* xref:proc-controller-inv-source-satellite[Red Hat Satellite 6]
* xref:proc-controller-inv-source-insights[Red Hat Insights]
* xref:proc-controller-inv-source-openstack[OpenStack]
* xref:proc-controller-inv-source-rh-virt[Red Hat Virtualization]
* xref:proc-controller-inv-source-aap[{PlatformName}]

Newly created configurations for inventory sources contain the default plugin configuration values. 
If you want your newly created inventory sources to match the output of a legacy source, you must apply a specific set of configuration values for that source. 
To ensure backward compatibility, {ControllerName} uses "templates" for each of these sources to force the output of inventory plugins into the legacy
format. 

For more information about sources and their templates, see xref:controller-inventory-templates[Supported inventory plugin templates].

`source_vars` that contain `plugin: foo.bar.baz` as a top-level key are replaced with the fully-qualified inventory plugin name at runtime based on the `InventorySource` source. 
For example, if ec2 is selected for the `InventorySource` then, at run-time, plugin is  set to `amazon.aws.aws_ec2`.
