= OAuth 2 token authentication

[role="_abstract"]
OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for token-based authentication and authorization.
OAuth 2 authentication is commonly used when interacting with the {ControllerName} API programmatically.

Similar to Basic authentication, you are given an OAuth 2 token with each API request through the Authorization header.
Unlike Basic authentication, OAuth 2 tokens have a configurable timeout and are scopable.
Tokens have a configurable expiration time and can be easily revoked for one user or for the entire {ControllerName} system by an administrator if needed.
You can do this with the link:{URLCentralAuth}/gw-token-based-authentication#ref-controller-revoke-oauth2-token[revoke_oauth2_tokens] management command, or by using the API as explained in link:{URLCentralAuth}/gw-token-based-authentication#ref-controller-revoke-access-token[Revoke an access token].

The different methods for obtaining OAuth2 access tokens in {ControllerName} include the following:

* Personal access tokens (PAT)
* Application token: Password grant type
* Application token: Implicit grant type
* Application token: Authorization Code grant type

A user needs to create an OAuth 2 token in the API or in the {MenuAMAdminOauthApps} tab of the {Gateway} UI.
For more information about creating tokens through the UI, see link:{URLCentralAuth}/gw-token-based-authentication#proc-controller-apps-create-tokens[Adding tokens].

For the purpose of this example, use the PAT method for creating a token in the API.
After you create it, you can set the scope.

[NOTE]
====
You can configure the expiration time of the token system-wide.
For more information, see link:{URLCentralAuth}/gw-token-based-authentication[Configuring access to external applications with token-based authentication].

Token authentication is best used for any programmatic use of the {ControllerName} API, such as Python scripts or tools such as curl.

*Curl example*

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
curl -u user:password -k -X POST https://<platform-host>/api/gateway/v1/tokens/
----

This call returns JSON data with the following:

image::api_oauth2_json_returned_token_value.png[API OAuth2 JSON]

You can use the value of the `token` property to perform a `GET` request for an {ControllerName} resource, such as Hosts:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
curl -k -X GET \
  -H “Content-Type: application/json”
  -H “Authorization: Bearer <oauth2-token-value>” \
  https://<platform-host>/api/controller/v2/hosts/
----

You can also run a job by making a `POST` to the job template that you want to start:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
curl -k -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <oauth2-token-value>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"limit" : "ansible"}' \
  https://<platform-host>/api/controller/v2/job_templates/14/launch/
----
