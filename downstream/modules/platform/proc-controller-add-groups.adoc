= Adding groups to inventories

Inventories are divided into groups, which can contain hosts and other groups. 
Groups are only applicable to standard inventories and are not a configurable directly through a Smart Inventory. 
You can associate an existing group through hosts that are used with standard inventories. 

The following actions are available for standard inventories:

* Create a new Group
* Create a new Host
* Run a command on the selected Inventory
* Edit Inventory properties
* View activity streams for Groups and Hosts
* Obtain help building your Inventory

[NOTE]
====
Inventory sources are not associated with groups. 
Spawned groups are top-level and can still have child groups. 
All of these spawned groups can have hosts.
