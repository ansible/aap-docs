= Upgrading a 2.4 single {ControllerName} node deployment to a {PlatformVers} {GrowthTopology}

[role="_abstract"]
Plan your upgrade from a 2.4 single {ControllerName} node setup to a {PlatformVers} {GrowthTopology}. 
Review the required infrastructure changes and requirements for a successful transition.
