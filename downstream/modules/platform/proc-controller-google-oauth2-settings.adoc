= Configuring Google OAuth2 authentication

To set up social authentication for Google, you must obtain an OAuth2 key and secret for a web application. To do this, you must first create a project and set it up with Google.

For instructions, see link:https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158849[Setting up OAuth 2.0] in the Google API Console Help documentation.

If you have already completed the setup process, you can access those credentials by going to the Credentials section of the link:https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/apis/dashboard?pli=1&supportedpurview=project[Google API Manager Console]. The OAuth2 key (Client ID) and secret (Client secret) are used to supply the required fields in the UI.
