= Providing a custom CA certificate

[role="_abstract"]
When you manually provide TLS certificates for {PlatformNameShort} services (such as `gateway_tls_cert`, `controller_tls_cert`, or `hub_tls_cert`), those certificates might be signed by a custom CA. 

Use the `custom_ca_cert` variable to add your CA certificate to the environment for proper authentication and trust of the manually provided certificates.

.Procedure
* If any of the TLS certificates you manually provided are signed by a custom CA, specify the CA certificate by using the following variable in your inventory file:
+
----
custom_ca_cert=<path_to_custom_ca_certificate>
----
+
If you have more than one CA certificate, combine them into a single file and reference the combined certificate with the `custom_ca_cert` variable.
