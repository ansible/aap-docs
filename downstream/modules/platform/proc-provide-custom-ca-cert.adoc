= Providing a custom CA certificate

When you manually provide TLS certificates, those certificates might be signed by a custom CA. Provide a custom CA certificate to ensure proper authentication and secure communication within your environment. If you have multiple custom CA certificates, you must merge them into a single file.

.Procedure
* If any of the TLS certificates you manually provided are signed by a custom CA, you must specify the CA certificate by using the following variable in your inventory file:
+
----
custom_ca_cert=<path_to_custom_ca_certificate>
----
+
If you have more than one CA certificate, combine them into a single file and reference the combined certificate with the `custom_ca_cert` variable.
