To set up enterprise authentication for {MSEntraID}, formerly known as {Azure} Active Directory (AD), you need to obtain an OAuth2 key and secret by registering your organization-owned application from Azure using the link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app[Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform].

Each key and secret must belong to a unique application and cannot be shared or reused between different authentication backends. To register the application, you must supply it with your webpage URL, which is the Callback URL shown in the Authenticator details for your authenticator configuration.
