= Legacy user login and account linking
 
[role="_abstract"]

Users can log in using their legacy accounts by selecting “I have a <component> account” and entering their credentials (username and password). If the login is successful, they may be prompted to link their account with another component account for example, {HubName} and {ControllerName}. If the login credentials are the same for both {HubName} and {ControllerName}, account linking is automatically done for that user.

After successful account linking, user accounts from both components are merged into a `gateway:legacy external password` authenticator. If user accounts are not automatically merged into the `gateway:legacy external password` authenticator, you must auto migrate directly to LDAP without linking accounts.
