= Surveys in job templates

[role="_abstract"]
Surveys provide a way to prompt users for input when launching a job from a job template. 
This input can then be used as variables in the playbook run.

Job types of *Run* or *Check* provide a way to set up surveys in the *Job Template* creation or editing screens. 
Surveys set extra variables for the playbook similar to *Prompt for Extra Variables* does, but in a user-friendly question and answer way. 
Surveys also permit for validation of user input. 
Select the *Survey* tab to create a survey.

*Example*

You can use surveys for several situations. 
For example, operations want to give developers a "push to stage" button that they can run without advance knowledge of Ansible.
When launched, this task could prompt for answers to questions such as "What tag should we release?".

You can ask many types of questions, including multiple-choice questions.
