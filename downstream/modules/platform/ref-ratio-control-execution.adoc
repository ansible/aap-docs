= Ratio of control to execution capacity

Assuming default configuration, the maximum recommended ratio of control capacity to execution capacity is 1:5 in traditional VM deployments. This ensures that there is enough control capacity to run jobs on all the execution capacity available and process the output. Any less control capacity in relation to the execution capacity, and it would not be able to launch enough jobs to use the execution capacity.

There are cases in which you might want to modify this ratio closer to 1:1. For example, in cases where a job produces a high level of job events, reducing the amount of execution capacity in relation to the control capacity helps relieve pressure on the control nodes to process that output.
