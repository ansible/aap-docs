= Deploying and configuring an Ansible MCP server

[role="_abstract"]

The standalone Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for {PlatformNameShort} is an independent service that enables external AI agents to securely interact with and use the platform's automation capabilities.

The MCP server functions as an interface, using the Model Context Protocol to standardize communication between the AI model and the {PlatformNameShort}'s public APIs. This integration demonstrates {PlatformNameShort}'s functionality as a set of structured tools that the AI agent can interact with, understand, and invoke. Organization administrators can deploy and configure an Ansible MCP server on the {OperatorBase} or {ContainerBase} of {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers}.
