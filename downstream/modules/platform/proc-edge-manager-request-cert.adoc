= Optional: Requesting an enrollment certificate for early binding

[role="_abstract"]

If you want to include an agent configuration in the image, complete the following steps:

.Procedure

. Log in to the flightctl CLI by following the steps in xref:edge-manager-log-into-CLI[Logging into the Red Hat Edge Manager through the CLI].
+
[NOTE]
====
The CLI uses the certificate authority pool of the host to verify the identity of the {RedHatEdge} service. The verification can lead to a TLS verification error when using self-signed certificates, if you do not add your certificate authority certificate to the pool. You can bypass the server verification by adding the `--insecure-skip-tls-verify` flag to your command.
====

. Get the enrollment credentials in the format of an agent configuration file by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
flightctl certificate request --signer=enrollment --expiration=365d --output=embedded > config.yaml
----
+

[NOTE]
====
* The `--expiration=365d` option specifies that the credentials are valid for a year.
* The `--output=embedded` option specifies that the output is an agent configuration file with the enrollment credentials embedded.
====
+
The returned `config.yaml` contains the URLs of the {RedHatEdge} service, the certificate authority bundle, and the enrollment client certificate and key for the agent.
See the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
