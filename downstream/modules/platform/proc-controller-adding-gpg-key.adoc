$ gpg --export --armour <key fingerprint> > my_public_key.asc
----

. From the navigation panel, select {MenuAMCredentials}.
. Click btn:[Create credential].
. Give a meaningful name for the new credential, for example, "Infrastructure team public GPG key".
. In the *Credential type* field, select *GPG Public Key*.
. Click *Browse* to locate and select the public key file, for example, `my_public_key.asc`.

You can select this credential in `projects <ug_projects_add>`, and content verification automatically takes place on future project
synchronizations.

[NOTE]

====
Use the project cache SCM timeout to control how often you want {ControllerName} to re-validate the signed content.
When a project is configured to update on launch (of any job template configured to use that project), you can enable the cache timeout setting, which sets it to update after `N` seconds have passed since the last update.
If validation is running too often, you can slow down how often project updates occur by specifying the time in the *Cache Timeout* field of the *Options Details* view of the project.
