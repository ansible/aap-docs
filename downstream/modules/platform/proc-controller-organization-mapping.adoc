= Organization mapping

[role="_abstract"]

You can control which users are placed into which {PlatformNameShort} organizations based on attributes such as their username and email address or based on groups provided from an authenticator. 

When organization mapping is positively evaluated, a specified organization is created, if it does not exist if the authenticator tied to the map is allowed to create objects.

. Select the *Organization* to which matching users are added or blocked.
