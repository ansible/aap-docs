= Existing security functionality

[role="_abstract"]
When deploying {ControllerName} into an existing secure environment, consider the following best practices to maintain the security posture of your organization.

Note the following:

* Do not disable SELinux or {ControllerName}'s existing multitenant containment. 
* Use {ControllerName}'s role-based access control (RBAC) to delegate the minimum level of privileges required to run automation. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.5/html/access_management_and_authentication/gw-managing-access[Managing access with role based access control].
* Use teams in {ControllerName} to assign permissions to groups of users rather than to users individually.
