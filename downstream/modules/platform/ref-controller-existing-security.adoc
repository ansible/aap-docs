= Existing security functionality

Do not disable SELinux or {ControllerName}'s existing multi-tenant containment. 
Use {ControllerName}'s role-based access control (RBAC) to delegate the minimum level of privileges required to run automation. 
Use teams in {ControllerName} to assign permissions to groups of users rather than to users individually.
