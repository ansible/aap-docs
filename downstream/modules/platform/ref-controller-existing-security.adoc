= Existing security functionality

[role="_abstract"]
Consider the following security best practices when implementing or deploying any new system to protect your organization's assets:

* Do not disable SELinux or {ControllerName}'s existing multi-tenant containment. 
* Use {ControllerName}'s role-based access control (RBAC) to delegate the minimum level of privileges required to run automation. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.6/html/access_management_and_authentication/gw-managing-access[Managing access with role based access control]
* Use teams in {ControllerName} to assign permissions to groups of users rather than to users individually.
