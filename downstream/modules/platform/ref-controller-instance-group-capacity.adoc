= Instance group capacity limits

There is external business logic that can drive the need to limit the concurrency of jobs sent to an instance group, or the maximum number of forks to be consumed.

For traditional instances and instance groups, you might want to enable two organizations to run jobs on the same underlying instances, but limit each organization's total number of concurrent jobs. 
This can be achieved by creating an instance group for each organization and assigning the value for `max_concurrent_jobs`.

For {ControllerName} groups, {ControllerName} is generally not aware of the resource limits of the OpenShift cluster. 
You can set limits on the number of pods on a namespace, or only resources available to schedule a certain number of pods at a time if no auto-scaling is in place. 
In this case, you can adjust the value for `max_concurrent_jobs`.

Another parameter available is `max_forks`. 
This provides additional flexibility for capping the capacity consumed on an instance group or container group. 
You can use this if jobs with a wide variety of inventory sizes and "forks" values are being run. 
This enables you to limit an organization to run up to 10 jobs concurrently, but consume no more than 50 forks at a time:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
max_concurrent_jobs: 10
max_forks: 50
----

If 10 jobs that use 5 forks each are run, an eleventh job waits until one of these finishes to run on that group (or be scheduled on a different group with capacity).

If 2 jobs are running with 20 forks each, then a third job with a `task_impact` of 11 or more waits until one of these finishes to run on that group (or be scheduled on a different group with capacity).

For container groups, using the `max_forks` value is useful given that all jobs are submitted using the same `pod_spec` with the same resource requests, irrespective of the "forks" value of the job. 
The default `pod_spec` sets requests and not limits, so the pods can "burst" above their requested value without being throttled or reaped. 
By setting the `max_forks value`, you can help prevent a scenario where too many jobs with large forks values get scheduled concurrently and cause the OpenShift nodes to be oversubscribed with multiple pods using more resources than their requested value.

To set the maximum values for the concurrent jobs and forks in an instance group, see link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html-single/automation_controller_user_guide/index#controller-create-instance-group[Creating an instance group] in the _{ControllerUG}_.
