= {ControllerNameStart}

Customers upgrading from 2.5 to {PlatformVers}  must also begin moving away from using nested teams in {ControllerName} APIs, as future releases will disable direct access to service APIs. 
After the upgrade, user data is synchronized between {ControllerName} and the platform-wide authentication gateway.

{ControllerNameStart} users, teams, roles, and organizations should become platform entities upon upgrade without the need to run additional "merge" processes. 
Customers that first upgraded from 2.4 to 2.5 will have teams that existed in 2.4 merged into {Gateway} when they upgrade from 2.5 to {PlatformVers}.

Roles should apply the permission model for non-admin access to execution, content, and event services.
