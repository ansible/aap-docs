= Setting up a GitLab webhook

{ControllerNameStart} has the ability to run jobs based on a triggered webhook event coming in. 
Job status information (pending, error, success) can be sent back only for pull request events. 
If {ControllerName} is not required to post job statuses back to the webhook service, go directly to step 3.

.Procedure
. Generate a _Personal Access Token_ (PAT) for use with {ControllerName}:
.. From the navigation panel in GitLab, select your avatar and menu:Edit profile[].
.. From the navigation panel, select menu:Access tokens[].
.. Complete the following fields:
* *Token name*: Enter a brief description about what this PAT is used for.
* *Expiration date*: Skip this field unless you want to set an expiration date for your webhook.
* *Select scopes*: Select those that are applicable to your integration. 
For {ControllerName}, *api* is the only selection necessary.
.. Click btn:[Create personal access token].
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
When the token is generated, ensure that you copy the PAT, as you need it in step 2. 
You cannot access this token again in GitLab.
====
+
. Use the PAT to optionally create a GitLab credential:
.. Go to your instance, and TBD[create a new credential for the GitLab PAT] using the generated token.
.. Make note of the name of this credential, as you use it in the job template that posts back to GitLab.

+
.. Click btn:[Save]. Your job template is set up to post back to GitLab.
. Go to a GitLab repository where you want to configure webhooks.
. From the navigation panel, select menu:Settings[Integrations].
. To complete the *Add webhook* page, you must check the *Enable Webhook* option in a job template or workflow job template. 
For more information, see step 3 in both xref:controller-create-job-template[Creating a job template] and xref:controller-create-workflow-template[Creating a workflow template].
. Complete the following fields:
* *URL*: Copy the contents of the *Webhook URL* from the job template and paste it here.
The results are sent to this address from GitLab.
* *Secret Token*: Copy the contents of the *Webhook Key* from the job template and paste it here.
* *Trigger*: Select the types of events you want to trigger a webhook. 
Any such event will trigger the job or workflow. 
To have job status (pending, error, success) sent back to GitLab, you must select *Merge request events* in the *Trigger* section.
* *SSL verification*: Leave *Enable SSL verification* selected.
. Click btn:[Add webhook].
. When your webhook is configured, it is displayed in the list *Project Webhooks* for your repository, along with the ability to test events, edit or delete the webhook. 
Testing a webhook event displays the results on each page whether it succeeded or failed.
