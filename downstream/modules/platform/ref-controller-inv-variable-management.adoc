= Variable management for inventory

[role="_abstract"]
Variables associated with hosts and groups in an inventory can be managed in several ways in {ControllerName}.

Keep variable data with the hosts and groups definitions (see the inventory editor), rather than using `group_vars/` and `host_vars/`. 
If you use dynamic inventory sources, {ControllerName} can synchronize such variables with the database while the *Overwrite Variables* option is not set.
