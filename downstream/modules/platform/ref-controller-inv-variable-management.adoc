= Variable Management for Inventory

Keep variable data with the hosts and groups definitions (see the inventory editor), rather than using `group_vars/` and `host_vars/`. 
If you use dynamic inventory sources, {ControllerName} can synchronize such variables with the database as long as the *Overwrite Variables* option is not set.
