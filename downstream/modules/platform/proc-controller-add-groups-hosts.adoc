= Adding new groups and hosts

Groups are only applicable to standard inventories and are not configurable directly through a Smart Inventory. 
You can associate an existing group through hosts that are used with standard inventories.

. Create a group and add the web server hosts, to add these hosts to the inventory.
. Click btn:[Cancel] (if you made no changes) or use the breadcrumb navigational links at the top of the {ControllerName} browser to return to the *Inventories* list view. Clicking btn:[Save] does not exit the *Details* dialog.
