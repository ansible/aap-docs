= Pinning instances manually to specific groups

[role="_abstract"]
If you have a special instance that needs to be only assigned to a specific instance group but do not want it to automatically join other groups by "percentage" or "minimum" policies, you can pin an instance manually to specific groups.,

.Procedure

. Add the instance to one or more instance groups' `policy_instance_list`.
. Update the instance's `managed_by_policy` property to be `False`.
+
This prevents the instance from being automatically added to other groups based on percentage and minimum policy.
It only belongs to the groups you have manually assigned it to:
