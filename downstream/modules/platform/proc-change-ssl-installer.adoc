= Changing the SSL certificate and key using the installer

[role="_abstract"]
The following procedure describes how to change the SSL certificate and key in the inventory file.

.Prerequisites

* If there is an intermediate certificate authority, you must append it to the server certificate.
* Both {ControllerName} and {HubName} use NGINX so the server certificate must be in PEM format.
* Use the correct order for the certificates: The server certificate comes first, followed by the intermediate certificate authority.

For further information, see the link:http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_certificate[ssl certificate section of the NGINX documentation].

.Procedure

. Copy the new SSL certificates and keys to a path relative to the {PlatformNameShort} installer.
. Add the absolute paths of the SSL certificates and keys to the inventory file. 
Refer to the link:{URLInstallationGuide}/appendix-inventory-files-vars#controller-variables[{ControllerNameStart} variables], link:{URLInstallationGuide}/appendix-inventory-files-vars#hub-variables[{HubNameStart} variables], and link:{URLInstallationGuide}/appendix-inventory-files-vars#event-driven-ansible-variables[{EDAcontroller} variables] sections of {LinkInstallationGuide} for guidance on setting these variables.

** {ControllerNameStart}: `web_server_ssl_cert`, `web_server_ssl_key`, `custom_ca_cert`
** {HubNameStart}: `automationhub_ssl_cert`, `automationhub_ssl_key`, `custom_ca_cert`
** {EDAcontroller}: `automationedacontroller_ssl_cert`, `automationedacontroller_ssl_key`, `custom_ca_cert`

[NOTE]
====
The `custom_ca_cert` must be the root certificate authority that signed the intermediate certificate authority.
This file is installed in `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors`.
