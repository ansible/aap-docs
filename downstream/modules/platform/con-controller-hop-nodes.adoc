= Hop Nodes

Hop nodes have very low memory and CPU utilization and there is no significant advantage to vertically scale hop nodes. 
A hop node that serves as the sole connection of many execution nodes to the control plane must be monitored for network bandwidth utilization. 
If this is seen to be saturated, changes to the network might be worth considering.
