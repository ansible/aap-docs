|====
| *RPM variable name* | *Container variable name* | *Description*
| `admin_email` | | The email address used for the admin user for {ControllerName}.

| `admin_password` | `controller_admin_password`| _Required_

{ControllerNameStart} admin password.

Passwords must be enclosed in quotes when they are provided in plain text in the inventory file.

Use of special characters for this variable is limited. The password can include any printable ASCII character except `/`, `”`, or `@`.

| `admin_username` | `controller_admin_user` | {ControllerNameStart} admin user.

Default = `admin`

| `automation_controller_main_url` | |  {ControllerNameStart} main URL.

| `controller_tls_files_remote` | `controller_tls_remote` | {ControllerNameStart} TLS remote files.

Default = `false`

| `nginx_disable_hsts` | `controller_nginx_disable_hsts` | Disable NGINX HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).

Default = `false`

| `nginx_disable_https` | `controller_nginx_disable_https` | Disable NGINX HTTPS.

Default = `false`

| `nginx_hsts_max_age` | `controller_nginx_hsts_max_age` | This variable specifies how long, in seconds, the system must be considered as an _HTTP Strict Transport Security_ (HSTS) host. That is, how long HTTPS is used only for communication.

Default = `63072000` seconds, or two years.

| `nginx_http_port` | `controller_nginx_http_port` | The NGINX HTTP server listens for inbound connections.

RPM default = `80`

Container default = `8080`

| `nginx_https_port` | `controller_nginx_https_port` | The NGINX HTTPS server listens for secure connections.

RPM Default = `443`

Container default = `8443`

| `nginx_user_headers` | `controller_nginx_user_headers` | List of NGINX headers for the {ControllerName} web server.

Each element in the list is provided to the web server's NGINX configuration as a separate line. 

Default = empty list

| `node_state` | | _Optional_

The status of a node or group of nodes.
Valid options are `active`, `deprovision` to remove a node from a cluster, or `iso_migrate` to migrate a legacy isolated node to an execution node.

Default = `active`

| `node_type` | | For `[automationcontroller]` group.

Two valid `node_types` can be assigned for this group.

A `node_type=control` means that the node only runs project and inventory updates, but not regular jobs.

A `node_type=hybrid` can run everything.

Default for this group = `hybrid`.

For `[execution_nodes]` group:

Two valid `node_types` can be assigned for this group.

A `node_type=hop` implies that the node forwards jobs to an execution node.

A `node_type=execution` implies that the node can run jobs.

Default for this group = `execution`.
| `peers` | | _Optional_

The `peers` variable is used to indicate which nodes a specific host or group connects to. Wherever this variable is defined, an outbound connection to the specific host or group is established.

This variable is used to add `tcp-peer` entries in the `receptor.conf` file used for establishing network connections with other nodes.

The peers variable can be a comma-separated list of hosts and groups from the inventory.
This is resolved into a set of hosts that is used to construct the `receptor.conf` file.

| `pg_database` | `controller_pg_database` | The name of the PostgreSQL database.

Default = `awx`

| `pg_host` | `controller_pg_host` | _Required_

The PostgreSQL host, which can be an externally managed database.

| `pg_password` | `controller_pg_password` | _Required_

The password for the PostgreSQL database.

Use of special characters for this variable is limited.
The `!`, `#`, `0` and `@` characters are supported. 
Use of other special characters can cause the setup to fail.

NOTE

You no longer have to provide a `pg_hashed_password` in your inventory file at the time of installation, because PostgreSQL 13 can now store user passwords more securely.

When you supply `pg_password` in the inventory file for the installer, PostgreSQL uses the SCRAM-SHA-256 hash to secure that password as part of the installation process.
| `pg_port` | `controller_pg_port` | The PostgreSQL port to use.

Default = `5432`

| `pg_username` | `controller_pg_username` | Your PostgreSQL database username.

Default = `awx`.

| `web_server_ssl_cert` | `controller_tls_cert` | _Optional_

`/path/to/webserver.cert`

Same as `automationhub_ssl_cert` but for web server UI and API.

| `web_server_ssl_key` | `controller_tls_key` | _Optional_

`/path/to/webserver.key`

Same as `automationhub_server_ssl_key` but for web server UI and API.

| | `controller_event_workers` | {ControllerNameStart} event workers.

Default = `4`

| | `controller_license_file` | The location of your {ControllerName} license file.

For example:

`controller_license_file=/path/to/license.zip`

If you are defining this variable as part of the postinstall process (`controller_postinstall = true`), then you need to also set the `controller_postinstall_dir` variable.

| | `controller_nginx_client_max_body_size` | NGINX maximum body size.

Default = `5m`

| | `controller_nginx_https_protocols` | NGINX HTTPS protocols.

Default = `[TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3]`

| | `controller_pg_socket` | PostgreSQL Controller UNIX socket.
| | `controller_secret_key` | The secret key value used by {ControllerName} to sign and encrypt data, ensuring secure communication and data integrity between services.

| | `controller_uwsgi_listen_queue_size` | {ControllerNameStart} uWSGI listen queue size.

Default = `2048`

| | `controller_postinstall` | Enable or disable the postinstall feature of the containerized installer.

If set to `true`, then you also need to set `controller_license_file` and `controller_postinstall_dir`.

Default = `false`

| | `controller_postinstall_dir` | The location of your {ControllerName} postinstall directory.
| | `controller_postinstall_async_delay` | Postinstall delay between retries.
