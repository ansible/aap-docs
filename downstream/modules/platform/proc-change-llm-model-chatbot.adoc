= Changing your LLM model 

[role="_abstract"]

If you have already deployed {AAPchatbot} but want to change your LLM model, you can create a new chatbot configuration secret for the new LLM model. Alternatively, if you want to use the same chatbot configuration secret, you must delete and redeploy the {AAPchatbot}. 

.Procedure

* To create and use a new chatbot configuration secret:

. xref:proc-create-chatbot-config-secret_deploying-chatbot-operator[Create a new chatbot configuration secret] with a different name for the new LLM model. 
. xref:proc-update-aap-operator-chatbot_deploying-chatbot-operator[Update the YAML file of the {PlatformNameShort} operator] with the new chatbot configuration secret name. 
+
The {PlatformNameShort} operator operator detects the new configuration and redeploys the {AAPchatbot}. 
. Verify that the chat interface service is running successfully. See the verification steps mentioned in the topic xref:proc-update-aap-operator-chatbot_deploying-chatbot-operator[Updating the YAML file of the {PlatformNameShort} operator].
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not update the existing chatbot configuration secret with the new LLM model, as the reconciliation logic does not check the updates made to the secret.
