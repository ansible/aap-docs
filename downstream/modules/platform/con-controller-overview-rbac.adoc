= Simplified role-based access control and auditing

[role="_abstract"]
With {ControllerName} you can:

* Grant permissions through Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* Keep some projects private while granting varied permissions (editing inventories or running playbooks in check or live mode)
* Enable users to use credentials without exposing the credentials to them.

{ControllerNameStart} records the history of operations and who made them, including objects edited and jobs launched.

If you want to give any user or team permissions to use a job template, you can assign permissions directly on the job template. Credentials are full objects in the {ControllerName} RBAC system, and can be assigned to many users or teams for use.

{ControllerNameStart} includes an _auditor_ type. A system-level auditor can see all aspects of the systems automation, but does not have permission to run or change automation.
An auditor is useful for a service account that scrapes automation information from the REST API.
