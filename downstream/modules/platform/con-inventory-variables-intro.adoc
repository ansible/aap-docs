= Inventory variables

[role="_abstract"]
Inventory variables control the installation program's behavior and configure {PlatformNameShort} components during deployment. 
Understand how to apply variables globally or to specific hosts to customize your installation.

The second part of the example inventory file, following `[all:vars]`, is a list of variables used by the installer. 
Using `all` means the variables apply to all hosts. 

To apply variables to a particular host, use `[hostname:vars]`. 
For example, `[automationhub:vars]`.
