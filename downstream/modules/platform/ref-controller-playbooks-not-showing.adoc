= Playbooks do not show up in the "Job Template" list

If your playbooks are not showing up in the *Job Template* list, check the following:

* Ensure that the playbook is valid YML and can be parsed by Ansible.
* Ensure that the permissions and ownership of the project path (`/var/lib/awx/projects`) is set up so that the "awx" system user can view the files. 
Run the following command to change the ownership:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]

chown awx -R /var/lib/awx/projects/
