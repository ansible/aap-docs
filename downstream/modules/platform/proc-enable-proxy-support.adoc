= Enabling proxy support through a load balancer
//FYI - In 2.5 EA, the System menu is specific to controller so do not change to AAP.
A forward proxy deals with client traffic, regulating and securing it.
To provide proxy server support, {ControllerName} handles proxied requests (such as ALB, NLB , HAProxy, Squid, Nginx and tinyproxy in front of {ControllerName}) using the *REMOTE_HOST_HEADERS* list variable in the {ControllerName} settings. By default, *REMOTE_HOST_HEADERS* is set to `["REMOTE_ADDR", "REMOTE_HOST"]`.

To enable proxy server support, edit the *REMOTE_HOST_HEADERS* field in the settings page for your {ControllerName}:

.Procedure

. From the navigation panel, select {MenuSetSystem}.
. Click btn:[Edit]
. In the *Remote Host Headers* field, enter the following values:
+
----
[
  "HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR",
  "REMOTE_ADDR",
  "REMOTE_HOST"
]
----
. Click btn:[Save] to save your settings.

{ControllerNameStart} determines the remote hostâ€™s IP address by searching through the list of headers in *Remote Host Headers* until the first IP address is located.
