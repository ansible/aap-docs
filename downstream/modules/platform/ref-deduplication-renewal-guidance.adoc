= Deduplication in the `RENEWAL_GUIDANCE` report

The default value for `METRICS_UTILITY_DEDUPLICATOR=renewal`. This is the original method, which analyzes `host_name`, `ansible_host`, `ansible_product_serial`, and `ansible_machine_id` separately, and merges entries when any of these items are duplicated.

`METRICS_UTILITY_DEDUPLICATOR=renewal` applies deduplication in multiple iterations. It is limited by the `REPORT_RENEWAL_GUIDANCE_DEDUP_ITERATIONS` environment variable, which defaults to `3`.

You can also run `METRICS_UTILITY_DEDUPLICATOR` with the following environment variables: 

* `METRICS_UTILITY_DEDUPLICATOR=renewal-hostname`. This is similar to `ccsp`, again preferring `ansible_host` over `host_name` when present. No other fields are considered.
* `METRICS_UTILITY_DEDUPLICATOR=renewal-experimental`. This is similar to `ccsp-experimental`, which first applies the hostname-based deduplication, then deduplicates again, merging when both of the serials match.
