= Sizing and scaling guidelines

API nodes process user requests (interactions with the UI or API) while worker nodes process the activations and other background tasks required for {EDAName} to function properly. The number of API nodes you require correlates to the desired number of users of the application and the number of worker nodes correlates to the desired number of activations you want to run.

Since activations are variable and controlled by worker nodes, the supported approach for scaling is to use separate API and worker nodes instead of hybrid nodes due to the efficient allocation of hardware resources by worker nodes. By separating the nodes, you can scale each type independently based on specific needs, leading to better resource utilization and cost efficiency.

An example of an instance in which you might consider scaling up your node deployment is when you want to deploy {EDAName} for a small group of users who will run a large number of activations. In this case, one API node is adequate, but if you require more, you can scale up to three additional worker nodes. 

To set up a multi-node deployment, follow the procedure in xref:proc-hs-eda-setup[Setting up horizontal scaling for {EDAcontroller}].
