= Fields discovery

Some {RedHatEdge} resources might expose additional supported fields.
You can discover the supported fields by using `flightctl` with the `--field-selector` option. 
If you try to use an unsupported field, the error message lists the available supported fields.

See the following examples:

[source,bash]
----
flightctl get device --field-selector='text'
----

[source,bash]
----
Error: listing devices: 400, message: unknown or unsupported selector: unable to resolve selector name "text". Supported selectors are: [metadata.alias metadata.creationTimestamp metadata.name metadata.nameoralias metadata.owner status.applicationsSummary.status status.lastSeen status.summary.status status.updated.status]
----

The field `text` is not a valid field for filtering.
The error message provides a list of supported fields that you can use with `--field-selector` for the `Device` resource.

You can then use one of the supported fields:

[source,bash]
----
flightctl get devices --field-selector 'metadata.alias contains cluster'
----

The `metadata.alias` field is checked with the containment operator `contains` to see if it has the value `cluster`.

.Examples

.Example 1: Excluding a specific device by name

The following command filters out a specific device by its name:

[source,bash]
----
flightctl get devices --field-selector 'metadata.name!=c3tkb18x9fw32fzx5l556n0p0dracwbl4uiojxu19g2'
----

.Example 2: Filter by owner, labels, and creation timestamp

This command retrieves devices owned by `Fleet/pos-fleet`, located in the `us` region, and created in 2024:

[source,bash]
----
flightctl get devices --field-selector 'metadata.owner=Fleet/pos-fleet, metadata.creationTimestamp >= 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z, metadata.creationTimestamp < //2025-01-01T00:00:00Z' -l 'region=us'
----

.Example 3: Filter by Owner, Labels, and Device Status

This command retrieves devices owned by `Fleet/pos-fleet`, located in the `us` region, and with a `status.updated.status` of either `Unknown`
or `OutOfDate`:

[source,bash]
----
flightctl get devices --field-selector 'metadata.owner=Fleet/pos-fleet, status.updated.status in (Unknown, OutOfDate)' -l 'region=us'
----
