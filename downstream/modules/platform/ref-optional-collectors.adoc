= Optional collectors for `gather` command

You can use the following optional collectors for the `gather` command:

* `main_jobhostsummary`
** If present by default, this incrementally collects data from the `main_jobhostsummary` table in the {ControllerName} database, containing information about jobs runs and managed nodes automated.
* `main_host`
** This collects daily snapshots of the `main_host` table in the {ControllerName} database and has managed nodes and hosts present across {ControllerName} inventories.
* `main_jobevent`
** This incrementally collects data from the `main_jobevent` table in the {ControllerName} database and contains information about which modules, roles, and Ansible collections are being used.
* `main_indirectmanagednodeaudit`
** This incrementally collects data from the `main_indirectmanagednodeaudit` table in the {ControllerName} database and contains information about indirectly managed nodes.
