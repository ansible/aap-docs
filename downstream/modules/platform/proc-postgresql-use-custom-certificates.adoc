= Using custom TLS certificates

[role="_abstract"]
Configure the installer to use your custom TLS certificates and keys for all {PlatformNameShort} services instead of the default self-signed certificates. This is achieved by setting inventory variables (`aap_ca_cert_file` and `aap_ca_key_file`), and optionally specifying a custom Certificate Authority (CA) certificate using `custom_ca_cert` to ensure trust and security across the platform.

.Procedure

* To replace these with your own custom certificate and key, set the following inventory file variables:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
aap_ca_cert_file=<path_to_ca_tls_certificate>
aap_ca_key_file=<path_to_ca_tls_key>
----

* If any of your certificates are signed by a custom Certificate Authority (CA), then you must specify the Certificate Authority's certificate by using the `custom_ca_cert` inventory file variable:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
custom_ca_cert=<path_to_custom_ca_certificate>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you have more than one custom CA certificate, combine them into a single file, then reference the combined certificate with the `custom_ca_cert` inventory file variable.
