= Encrypting the platform gateway database password

[role="_abstract"]
System administrators can encrypt the database password used by {Gateway} and apply it directly to the configuration file, resolving issues related to the `SECRET_KEY` loading order.

[NOTE]
====
{GatewayStart} uses the Django framework, which requires the `SECRET_KEY` to be fully loaded into memory before the decryption function (`ansible_encryption.decrypt_string()`) is called. 
If the decryption call runs before the key is loaded, the process fails, preventing {Gateway} from accessing the database. 
====

.Procedure

. Access the command line on the platform gateway node.
. Use the `aap-gateway-manage shell_plus` command to open an interactive Django shell:
+
----
aap-gateway-manage shell_plus
----
+
. Inside the shell, run the following commands to import the encryption library, set your password, and generate the encrypted string:
+
----
>>> from ansible_base.lib.utils.encryption import ansible_encryption
>>> value = 'your-database-password' # REPLACE with your actual password
>>> encrypted_value = ansible_encryption.encrypt_string(value)
>>> print(encrypted_value)
----
+
. Copy the entire output string starting with `$encrypted$`. 
This is your encrypted password.
. Exit the shell using `quit()`.
. Open the {Gateway} configuration file for editing:
+
----
vi /etc/ansible-automation-platform/gateway/settings.py
----
+
. Locate the section defining the `DATABASES` variable. 
You must insert the code to load the `SECRET_KEY` before the `DATABASES` dictionary is defined.
. Update the file to include the highlighted code, replacing only the placeholder text for the `PASSWORD` key with your copied encrypted string:
+
----
from ansible_base.lib.utils.encryption import ansible_encryption
from django.conf import settings

# ... other configuration settings ...

# The GATEWAY_SECRET_KEY_FILE is typically defined earlier in settings.
# The SECRET_KEY must be loaded before the decryption function is called.
with open(GATEWAY_SECRET_KEY_FILE, 'rb') as f:
    settings.SECRET_KEY = f.read().strip()

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'HOST': '10.0.108.77', # Example host, use your value
        # ... other database settings ...
        'PASSWORD': 
        ansible_encryption.decrypt_string('$encrypted$UTF8$AESCBC$Z0FBQUFBQnBBNU...
        <YOUR_ENCRYPTED_STRING>...QWdPUHM9'),
        # ... other database settings ...
        'PORT': '5432', # Example port, use your value
    }
}
----
+
. Save and close the file. 
. Restart {Gateway} to load the new encrypted configuration:
+
----
sudo systemctl restart aap-gateway
----

.Verification

Confirm that {Gateway} starts without errors and that you can access the platform UI, which indicates a successful database connection.
