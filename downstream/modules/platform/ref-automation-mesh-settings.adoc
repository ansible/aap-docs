= Automation mesh settings

You can route outbound communication from the receptor on an automation mesh node through a proxy server. 
If your proxy does not strip out TLS certificates then an installation of {PlatformName} automatically supports the use of a proxy server. 

Every node on the mesh must have a Certifying Authority that the installer creates on your behalf.

The default install location for the Certifying Authority is:

`/etc/receptor/tls/ca/mesh-CA.crt`

The certificates and keys created on your behalf use the nodeID for their names:

For the certificate:
`/etc/receptor/tls/NODEID.crt`

For the key:
`/etc/receptor/tls/NODEID.key'
