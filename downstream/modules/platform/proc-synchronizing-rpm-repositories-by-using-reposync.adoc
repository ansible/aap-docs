= Synchronizing RPM repositories using reposync

To perform a reposync you need a RHEL host that has access to the internet. After the repositories are synced, you can move the repositories to the disconnected network hosted from a web server.

.Procedure

. Attach the BaseOS and AppStream required repositories:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos \
    --enable rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms \
    --enable rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms
----

. Perform the reposync:
+
----
# dnf install yum-utils
# reposync -m --download-metadata --gpgcheck \
    -p /path/to/download
----

.. Use reposync with `--download-metadata` and without `--newest-only`. See link://https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5186621[RHEL 8] Reposync.

* If you are not using `--newest-only,` the repos downloaded will be ~90GB.

* If you are using `--newest-only,` the repos downloaded will be ~14GB.

. If you plan to use {RHSSO}, sync these repositories:

.. jb-eap-7.3-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms
.. rh-sso-7.4-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms

+
After the reposync is completed, your repositories are ready to use with a web server.


. Move the repositories to your disconnected network.
