= Modifying the number of simultaneous rulebook activations during or after {EDAName} installation

[role="_abstract"]
If you plan to install {EDAName} on {OCPShort} and modify the number of simultaneous rulebook activations, you must add the required `EDA_MAX_RUNNING_ACTIVATIONS` parameter to your {PlatformNameShort} custom resources. By default, {EDAcontroller} allows 12 activations per node to run simultaneously. 

.Procedure
* Add the required `EDA_MAX_RUNNING_ACTIVATIONS` parameter to your {PlatformNameShort} custom resources. See the example in appendix link:{URLOperatorInstallation}#eda_max_running_activations[EDA_MAX_RUNNING_ACTIVATIONS].

[NOTE]
====
`EDA_MAX_RUNNING_ACTIVATIONS` for {OCPShort} is a global value since there is no concept of worker nodes when installing {EDAName} on {OCPShort}.
