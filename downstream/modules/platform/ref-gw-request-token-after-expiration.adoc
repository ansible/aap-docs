= Requesting an access token after expiration

[role="_abstract"]

The default expiration for access tokens is 1 year.

The best way to set up application integrations by using the *Authorization code* grant type is to allowlist the origins for those cross-site requests. More generally, you must allowlist the service or application you are integrating with the platform, for which you want to provide access tokens.

To do this, have your administrator add this allowlist to their local {PlatformNameShort} settings file: 

----
CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL = True
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES = [
    r"http://django-oauth-toolkit.herokuapp.com*",
    r"http://www.example.com*"
]
----

Where `http://django-oauth-toolkit.herokuapp.com` and `http://www.example.com` are applications requiring tokens with which to access the platform.
