= Requesting an access token after expiration

The *Gateway access token expiration* defaults to 600 seconds (10 minutes).

The best way to set up application integrations using the *Authorization code* grant type is to allowlist the origins for those cross-site requests. More generally, you must allowlist the service or application you are integrating with the platform, for which you want to provide access tokens.

To do this, have your administrator add this allowlist to their local {PlatformNameShort} settings file: 

----
CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL = True
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES = [
    r"http://django-oauth-toolkit.herokuapp.com*",
    r"http://www.example.com*"
]
----

Where `http://django-oauth-toolkit.herokuapp.com` and `http://www.example.com` are applications requiring tokens with which to access the platform.
