= Configuring LDAP authentication

As a platform administrator, you can configure LDAP as the source for account authentication information for {PlatformNameShort} users. 

When LDAP is configured, an account is created for any user who logs in with an LDAP username and password and they can be automatically placed into organizations as either regular users or organization administrators. 

Users created through an LDAP login should not change their username, first name, last name, or set a local password for themselves. Any changes made to this information is overwritten the next time the user logs in to the platform. 

.Procedure

. From the navigation panel, select {MenuAMAuthentication}.
. Click btn:[Create authentication].
. Select *LDAP* from the *Authentication type* list and click btn:[Next].
. Enter a *Name* for this LDAP configuration. The configuration name is required, must be unique across all authenticators, and must not be longer than 512 characters.
. In the *LDAP Server URI* field, enter or modify the list of LDAP servers to which you want to connect. This field supports multiple addresses.
. In the *LDAP Bind DN text* field, enter the Distinguished Name (DN) to specify the user that the Ansible Automation Platform uses to connect to the LDAP server. For example:
+
----
CN=josie,CN=users,DC=website,DC=com
----
+
. In the *LDAP Bind Password* text field, enter the password to use for the binding user.
. Select a group type from the *LDAP Group Type* list.
+
[NOTE]
====
The LDAP group types that are supported by the Ansible Automation Platform use the underlying link:https://django-auth-ldap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#django_auth_ldap.config.LDAPGroupType[django-auth-ldap library]. 
====
+
. To use *LDAP User DN Template* as an alternative to user search, enter the name of the template. This approach is more efficient for user lookups than searching if it is usable in your organizational environment. If this setting has a value it will be used instead of the *LDAP User Search* setting.
. *LDAP Start TLS* is disabled by default. To enable TLS when the LDAP connection is not using SSL, set the switch to *On*.

. Enter any *LDAP Connection Options* to set for the LDAP connection. 
. In the *LDAP Group Type Parameters* field, enter the parameters required for the LDAP Group Type you previously selected to identify LDAP groups and the members that belong to those groups.
+
To determine the parameters that a specific *LDAP Group Type* requires, refer to the link:https://django-auth-ldap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#django_auth_ldap.config.LDAPGroupType[django_auth_ldap documentation] on the classes `init` parameters.
+
. In the *LDAP Group Search* field, specify which groups should be searched and how to search them. 
. In the *LDAP User Attribute Map* field, enter user attributes to map LDAP fields to your Ansible Automation Platform users for example, email or first_name. 
. In the *LDAP User Search* field, enter where to search for users during authentication.
