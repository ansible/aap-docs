= Configuring LDAP authentication

As a platform administrator, you can configure LDAP as the source for account authentication information for {PlatformNameShort} users. 

[NOTE]
====
If the LDAP server you want to connect to has a certificate that is self-signed or signed by a corporate internal certificate authority (CA), the CA certificate must be added to the systemâ€™s trusted CAs. Otherwise, connection to the LDAP server will result in an error that the certificate issuer is not recognized.
====

When LDAP is configured, an account is created for any user who logs in with an LDAP username and password and they can be automatically placed into organizations as either regular users or organization administrators. 

Users created through an LDAP login should not change their username, first name, last name, or set a local password for themselves. Any changes made to this information is overwritten the next time the user logs in to the platform. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Migration of LDAP authentication settings are not supported for 2.4 to 2.5 in the platform UI. If you are upgrading from {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 to 2.5, be sure to save your authentication provider data before upgrading.

.Procedure

. From the navigation panel, select {MenuAMAuthentication}.
. Click btn:[Create authentication].
. Select *LDAP* from the *Authentication type* list and click btn:[Next].
. Enter a *Name* for this LDAP configuration. The configuration name is required, must be unique across all authenticators, and must not be longer than 512 characters.

include::snippets/snip-gw-authentication-auto-migrate.adoc[]

. In the *LDAP Server URI* field, enter or modify the list of LDAP servers to which you want to connect. This field supports multiple addresses.
. In the *LDAP Bind DN text* field, enter the Distinguished Name (DN) to specify the user that the {PlatformNameShort} uses to connect to the LDAP server. For example:
+
----
CN=josie,CN=users,DC=website,DC=com
----
+
. In the *LDAP Bind Password* text field, enter the password to use for the binding user.
. Select a group type from the *LDAP Group Type* list. The *LDAP Group Type* list includes the following groups:
+
* `PosixGroupType`
* `GroupOfNamesType`
* `GroupOfUniqueNamesType`
* `ActiveDirectoryGroupType`
* `OrganizationalRoleGroupType`
* `MemberDNGroupType`
* `NISGroupType`
* `NestedGroupOfNamesType`
* `NestedGroupOfUniqueNamesType`
* `NestedActiveDirectoryGroupType`
* `NestedOrganizationalRoleGroupType`
* `NestedMemberDNGroupType`
* `PosixUIDGroupType`
+
[NOTE]
====
The group types that are supported by {PlatformNameShort} use the underlying link:https://django-auth-ldap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#django_auth_ldap.config.LDAPGroupType[django-auth-ldap library]. To specify the parameters for the selected group type, see Step 13 of this procedure.
====
. To use *LDAP User DN Template* as an alternative to user search, enter the name of the template. This approach is more efficient for user lookups than searching if it is usable in your organizational environment. If this setting has a value it will be used instead of the *LDAP User Search* setting.
. *LDAP Start TLS* is disabled by default. To enable TLS when the LDAP connection is not using SSL, set the switch to *On*.
+
include::snippets/snip-gw-authentication-additional-auth-fields.adoc[]
+
. Enter any *LDAP Connection Options* to set for the LDAP connection. 
. Depending on the selected *LDAP Group Type*, different parameters are available in the *LDAP Group Type Parameters* field to account for this. `LDAP_GROUP_TYPE_PARAMS` is a dictionary, which is converted to `kwargs` and passed to the *LDAP Group Type* class selected. There are two common parameters used by group types: `name_attr` and `member_attr`. Where `name_attr` defaults to `cn` and `member_attr` defaults to `member`: 
+
----
{"name_attr": "cn", "member_attr": "member"}
----
+
To determine the parameters that a specific *LDAP Group Type* requires, refer to the link:https://django-auth-ldap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#django_auth_ldap.config.LDAPGroupType[django_auth_ldap documentation] on the classes `init` parameters.
+
. In the *LDAP Group Search* field, specify which groups should be searched and how to search them. 
. In the *LDAP User Attribute Map* field, enter user attributes to map LDAP fields to your {PlatformNameShort} users, for example, `email` or `first_name`. 
. In the *LDAP User Search* field, enter where to search for users during authentication. 
+
----
[
"OU=Users,DC=website,DC=com",
"SCOPE_SUBTREE",
"(cn=%(user)s)"
]
----
+
If the *LDAP User DN Template* is not set, the {PlatformNameShort} authenticates to LDAP using the *Bind DN Template* and *LDAP Bind Password*. After authentication, an LDAP search is performed to locate the user specified by this field. If the user is found, {PlatformNameShort} validates the provided password against the user found by the LDAP search. 
Multiple search queries are supported for users with `LDAPUnion` by entering multiple search terms. For example:
+
----
[
    [
        "ou=users,dc=example,dc=com",
        "SCOPE_SUBTREE",
        "uid=%(user)s"
    ],
     [
        "ou=employees,dc=subdivision,dc=com",
        "SCOPE_SUBTREE",
        "uid=%(user)s"
     ]
]
----
+
If non-unique users are found during multiple searches, those users will not be able to log in to {PlatformNameShort}. Based on the example provided, if a user with `uid=jdoe` was found in both the `ou=users,dc=example,dc=com` and `ou=employees,dc=subdivision,dc=com`, neither `jdoe` user would be able to log in. All other unique users that are found in either branch would still be able to log in.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the field *LDAP User DN Template* is populated, it takes precedence over the  *LDAP User Search* field and only the template will be used to authenticate users.
