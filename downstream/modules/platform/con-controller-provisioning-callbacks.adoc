= Provisioning Callbacks

Provisioning Callbacks are a feature of {ControllerName} that enable a host to start a playbook run against itself, rather than waiting for a user to launch a job to manage the host from the {ControllerName} console.

Provisioning Callbacks are only used to run playbooks on the calling host and are meant for cloud bursting.
Cloud bursting is a cloud computing configuration that enables a private cloud to access public cloud resources by "bursting" into a public cloud when computing demand spikes.

.Example

New instances with a need for client to server communication for configuration, such as transmitting an authorization key, not to run a job against another host. 
This provides for automatically configuring the following:

* A system after it has been provisioned by another system (such as AWS auto-scaling, or an OS provisioning system like kickstart or preseed).
* Launching a job programmatically without invoking the {ControllerName} API directly. 

The job template launched only runs against the host requesting the provisioning.

This is often accessed with a firstboot type script or from `cron`.
