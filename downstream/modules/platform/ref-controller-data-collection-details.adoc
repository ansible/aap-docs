= Details of data collection

{Analytics} collects the following classes of data from {ControllerName}:

* Basic configuration, such as which features are enabled, and what operating system is being used
* Topology and status of the {ControllerName} environment and hosts, including capacity and health
* Counts of automation resources:

** organizations, teams, and users
** inventories and hosts
** credentials (indexed by type)
** projects (indexed by type)
** templates
** schedules
** active sessions
** running and pending jobs
* Job execution details (start time, finish time, launch type, and success)
* Automation task details (success, host id, playbook/role, task name, and module used)

You can use `awx-manage gather_analytics` (without `--ship`) to inspect the data that {ControllerName} sends, so that you can satisfy your data collection concerns. 
This creates a tarball that contains the analytics data that is sent to Red Hat.

This file contains a number of JSON and CSV files. 
Each file contains a different set of analytics data.
