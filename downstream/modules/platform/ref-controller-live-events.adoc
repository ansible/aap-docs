= Live events in the Controller UI

Events are broadcast to all control nodes in {ControllerName} so that the events can be served over websocket to any client that connects to a control node's web service. 
This task is expensive, and becomes more expensive as the number of events that the cluster is producing increases. 
The number of control nodes also increases, because all events are broadcast to all nodes regardless of how many clients are subscribed to particular jobs.

There are settings that enable you to influence behavior of how job events are displayed in the UI and served over websockets.

For large clusters with large job event loads, a way to avoid the additional overhead is to disable live streaming events (the events are only loaded on hard refresh to a job's output detail page).
This is possible by setting `UI_LIVE_UPDATES_ENABLED` to `false` or setting the *Enable Activity Stream* toggle to *Off* from the UI *Miscellaneous System Settings* window.

If disabling live streaming of events is not possible, for very verbose jobs with many events, administrators can consider reducing the number of events shown per second or before truncating or hiding events in the UI. 

The following settings all address issues of rate or size of events.

.Troubleshooting

{ControllerNameStart} uses port 80/443 on the {ControllerName} server to stream live updates of playbook activity and other events to the client browser. 
By default, these ports are configured for 80/443, but if they are blocked by firewalls, close any firewall rules that opened up or added for the previous websocket ports.
This ensures that your firewall allows traffic through this port.
