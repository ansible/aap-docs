= OpenShift or Kubernetes API Bearer Token credential type

Select this credential type to create instance groups that point to a Kubernetes or OpenShift container. 

For more information, see link:https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/4.4/html/administration/containers_instance_groups.html#ag-ext-exe-env[Container and Instance Groups] in the _{ControllerAG}_.

Provide the following information for container credentials:

* *OpenShift or Kubernetes API Endpoint* (required): The endpoint used to connect to an OpenShift or Kubernetes container.
* *API Authentication Bearer Token* (required): The token used to authenticate the connection.
* Optional: *Verify SSL*: You can check this option to verify the server's SSL/TLS certificate is valid and trusted. 
Environments that use internal or private _Certificate Authority_ (CA) must leave this option unchecked to disable verification.
* *Certificate Authority Data*: Include the `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` and `END CERTIFICATE` lines when pasting the certificate, if provided.

A container group is a type of instance group that has an associated credential that enables connection to an OpenShift cluster. 
To set up a container group, you must have the following items:

* A namespace you can start into. Although every cluster has a default namespace, you can use a specific namespace.
* A service account that has the roles that enable it to start and manage pods in this namespace.
* If you use {ExecEnvShort}s in a private registry, and have a container registry credential associated with them in {ControllerName}, the service account also requires the roles to get, create, and delete secrets in the namespace. 
+
If you do not want to give these roles to the service account, you can pre-create the `ImagePullSecrets` and specify them on the pod spec for the container group. 
In this case, the {ExecEnvShort} must not have a Container Registry credential associated, or {ControllerName} attempts to create the secret for you in the namespace.
* A token associated with that service account (OpenShift or Kubernetes Bearer Token)
* A CA certificate associated with the cluster
