= High availability {HubName}

[role="_abstract"]
High availability increases reliability and scalability for {HubName} by distributing workload across many nodes and eliminating single points of failure.

HA deployments of {HubName} have multiple nodes that concurrently run the same service with a load balancer distributing workload (an "active-active" configuration).
This configuration eliminates single points of failure to minimize service downtime and allows you to easily add or remove nodes to meet workload demands.
