= Configuring SAML authentication

SAML allows the exchange of authentication and authorization data between an Identity Provider (IdP) and a Service Provider (SP). {PlatformNameShort} is a SAML SP that can be configured to talk with one or more SAML IdPs in order to authenticate users. Based on groups and attributes optionally provided by the IdP users can be placed into teams and organizations in {PlatformNameShort} based on authenticator maps tied to this authenticator.
