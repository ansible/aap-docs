= Removing {EDAName} 2.4 database

{PlatformNameShort} 2.6 supports upgrades from {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 environments for all components, except for {EDAName}. Database migrations between {EDAName} 2.4 and {EDAName} 2.6 are not compatible.

If you are upgrading from {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 to 2.6, you must first remove the {EDAName} 2.4 database. A new {EDAName} 2.6 database gets created automatically after the upgrade. After the upgrade is completed, a new {EDAName} 2.6 database is created. You can then reconnect {MenuAD} ({EDAcontroller}) to {MenuTopAE} ({ControllerName}) to run rulebook activations. 

[NOTE]
====
When upgrading from {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 to 2.6, the Event-driven Ansible component will be updated automatically. You are not required to delete the existing Event-Driven Ansible 2.5 database before upgrading your platform to 2.6.
