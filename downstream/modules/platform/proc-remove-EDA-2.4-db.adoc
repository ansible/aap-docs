= Removing {EDAName} 2.4 database

{PlatformNameShort} 2.5 supports upgrades from {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 environments for all components, except for {EDAName}. Database migrations between {EDAName} 2.4 and {EDAName} 2.5 are not compatible.

If you are upgrading from {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 to 2.5, you must first remove the {EDAName} 2.4 database. A new {EDAName} 2.5 database gets created automatically after the upgrade. You can then reconnect {MenuAD} ({EDAcontroller}) to {MenuTopAE} ({ControllerName}) to run rulebook activations. 

.Procedure
. Shut down the old {EDAName} 2.4 host.
. Log in to your database host with a user that has superuser privileges.
+
`# psql -h <hostname> -U <username>`
. When prompted, enter your password.
. Delete the existing {EDAName} 2.4 database by using the following command:
+
`DROP DATABASE automationedacontroller`

. When prompted, reenter your password.

. After the upgrade is completed, reconnect {MenuAD} ({EDAcontroller}) to {MenuTopAE} ({ControllerName}) to run rulebook activations successfully.
