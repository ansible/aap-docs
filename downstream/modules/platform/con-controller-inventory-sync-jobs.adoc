= Inventory sync jobs

[role="_abstract"]
Inventory synchronization jobs update the inventory data in {ControllerNameStart} by pulling the latest information from the configured inventory sources. 
This ensures that the inventory reflects the current state of the managed infrastructure.

Inventory sync jobs can be scheduled to run at regular intervals or triggered manually by users. 
These jobs gather data such as host details, group memberships, and variables from various sources such as cloud providers, dynamic inventory scripts, or static files.

When an inventory synchronization is executed, the results display in the *Output* tab. 

For more information about inventory synchronization, see link:{URLControllerUserGuide}/controller-inventories#ref-controller-constructed-inventories[Constructed inventories].

If used, the Ansible CLI displays the same information. 
This can be useful for debugging.
The `ANSIBLE_DISPLAY_ARGS_TO_STDOUT` parameter is set to `False` for all playbook runs. 
This parameter matches Ansible's default behavior and does not display task arguments in task headers in the Job *Details* interface to avoid leaking certain sensitive module parameters to `stdout`. 
To restore the earlier behavior, set `ANSIBLE_DISPLAY_ARGS_TO_STDOUT` to `True` through the `AWX_TASK_ENV` configuration setting. 

For more information, see link:http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html#envvar-ANSIBLE_DISPLAY_ARGS_TO_STDOUT[ANSIBLE_DISPLAY_ARGS_TO_STDOUT] in the Ansible Configuration Settings.

// For AAP-45084, I need to confirm if the latest env shows the following options:
You can btn:[Relaunch job], btn:[Cancel job], download image:download.png[Download,15,15] the job output, or delete image:delete-button.png[Delete,15,15] the job.

[NOTE]
====
You can perform an inventory update while a related job is running. 
In cases where you have a large project (around 10 GB), disk space on `/tmp` can be an issue.
