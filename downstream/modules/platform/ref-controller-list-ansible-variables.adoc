= View a listing of all ansible_ variables

By default, Ansible gathers "facts" about the machines under its management, accessible in Playbooks and in templates. 

To view all facts available about a machine, run the `setup` module as an _ad hoc_ action:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
ansible -m setup hostname
----

This prints out a dictionary of all facts available for that particular host.
