= Selecting a date range for your CCSPv2 report

The default behavior of the CCSPv2 report is to build a report for the previous month. The following examples describe how to override this default behavior to select a specific date range for your report:  

----
# Build report for a specific month
metrics-utility build_report --month=2025-03 

# Build report for a specific date range, including the provided days
metrics-utility build_report --since=2025-03-01 --until=2025-03-31

# Build report for a last 6 months from a current date
metrics-utility build_report --since=6months

# Build report for a last 6 months from a current date overwriting an existing report
metrics-utility build_report --since=6months --force
