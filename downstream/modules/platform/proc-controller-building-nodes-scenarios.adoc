. At any node where you want to create a split scenario, hover over the node from which the split scenario begins and click the plus (image:options_menu.png[Plus icon,15,15]) icon on the parent node and *Add step and link*.
This adds multiple nodes from the same parent node, creating sibling nodes.

. Refer to the key by clicking btn:[Legend] to identify the meaning of the symbols and colors associated with the graphical depiction.

[NOTE]
====
If you remove a node that has a follow-on node attached to it in a workflow with a set of sibling nodes that has varying edge types, the attached node automatically joins the set of sibling nodes and retains its edge type:
