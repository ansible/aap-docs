= Impacts of modifying the `grpc_settings.py` file

[role="_abstract"]
The gRPC server is responsible for helping with authentication between the different platform services. Altering the settings in the `grpc_settings.py` file can significantly impact the behavior and performance of the gRPC connection, especially in terms of connection stability.

It is important to thoroughly test any changes made to the gRPC settings before deploying them to production to ensure that the gRPC server functions as expected.
