= Add components to an existing deployment

[role="_abstract"]

You can link any components of the {PlatformNameShort}, that you have already installed to a new *{PlatformNameShort}* instance. 

The following procedure simulates a scenario where you have {ControllerName} as an existing component and want to add {HubName} and {EDAName}. 

.Procedure 
. Log in to {OCP}.
. Navigate to menu:Operators[Installed Operators].
. Select your {OperatorPlatformNameShort} deployment.
. Click btn:[Subscriptions] and edit your *Update channel* to *stable-2.6*.
. Click btn:[Details] and on the *{PlatformNameShort}* tile click btn:[Create instance].
. From the *Create {PlatformNameShort}* page enter a name for your instance in the *Name* field.
* When deploying an {PlatformNameShort} instance, ensure that `auto_update` is set to the default value of `false` on your existing {ControllerName} instance in order for the integration to work.
. Click btn:[YAML view] and copy in the following:

[NOTE]
====
If you have an existing controller with a managed Postgres pod, after creating the *{PlatformNameShort}* resource your {ControllerName} instance will continue to use that original Postgres pod. If you were to do a fresh install you would have a single Postgres managed pod for all instances.
