Learn how {ControllerNameStart} handles external access via HTTP and HTTPS.
{ControllerNameStart} uses Nginx as a reverse proxy to handle external access. Key features include:

* {ControllerNameStart} is accessed using standard HTTP or HTTPS on standard ports, provided by Nginx. 
* The system installs a self-signed certificate or key by default; you can give a locally appropriate certificate and key. 
* The system configures SSL/TLS algorithm support in the `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` configuration file. 
* The system uses an "intermediate" profile by default, which you can configure. 
You must reapply changes after each update.
