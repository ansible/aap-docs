.Examples

.Example 1: Excluding a specific device by name

The following command filters out a specific device by its name:

[source,bash]
----
flightctl get devices --field-selector 'metadata.name!=c3tkb18x9fw32fzx5l556n0p0dracwbl4uiojxu19g2'
----

.Example 2: Filter by owner, labels, and creation timestamp

This command retrieves devices owned by `Fleet/pos-fleet`, located in the `us` region, and created in 2024:

[source,bash]
----
flightctl get devices --field-selector 'metadata.owner=Fleet/pos-fleet, metadata.creationTimestamp >= 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z, metadata.creationTimestamp < 2025-01-01T00:00:00Z' -l 'region=us'
----

.Example 3: Filter by Owner, Labels, and Device Status

This command retrieves devices owned by `Fleet/pos-fleet`, located in the `us` region, and with a `status.updated.status` of either `Unknown`
or `OutOfDate`:

[source,bash]
----
flightctl get devices --field-selector 'metadata.owner=Fleet/pos-fleet, status.updated.status in (Unknown, OutOfDate)' -l 'region=us'
