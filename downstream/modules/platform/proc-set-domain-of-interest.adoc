With domain filtering, you can customize the content displayed in the *Jobs* and *Templates* sub-sections of Automation Execution. Jobs and templates are linked to descriptive labels. When you select a label, you can filter out less-relevant resources, giving you easy access to the resources relevant to your area of interest. 

.Procedure

. From the navigation panel, select {MenuAEJobs} or {MenuAETemplates}.
. Beneath the page heading, next to *Domains*, is a list of topic-related labels. Select a label to filter jobs and job templates so that only content related to the labels is shown. You can choose more than one label. 
. To clear your selection, click the *X*. 
. To customize your domain options, select the image:wrench.png[Wrench,15,15] icon. In the modal that appears, select *Add Domain* to add new domains to filter with. 

[NOTE]

Navigate to {MenuAETemplates}, select your job template, and click btn:[Edit template]. On the editing screen, enter the label you want to use in the *Labels* field and click btn:[Save job template].
