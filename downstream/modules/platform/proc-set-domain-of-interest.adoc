= Setting your domains of interest

With domain filtering, you can customize the content displayed in the *Jobs* and *Templates* sub-sections of Automation Execution. Jobs and templates are linked to descriptive labels. When you select a label, you can filter out less-relevant resources, giving you easy access to the resources relevant to your area of interest. 

.Procedure

. From the navigation panel, select {MenuAEJobs} or {MenuAETemplates}.
. Beneath the page heading, next to *Domains*, is a list of topic-related labels. Select a label to filter jobs and job templates so that only content related to the labels is shown. You can choose more than one label. 
. To clear your selection, click the *X*. 
. To customize your domain options, select the image:wrench.png[Wrench,15,15] icon. In the modal that appears, select *Add Domain* to add new domains to filter with. 

.Next steps
You can add labels to your individual job templates to make the templates appear as resources when you filter with the related domain label. Go to {MenuAETemplates}, select your job template, and click btn:[Edit template]. On the editing screen, enter the label you want to use in the *Labels* field and click btn:[Save job template].
