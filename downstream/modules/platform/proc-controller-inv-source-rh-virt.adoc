[NOTE]
====
Red Hat Virtualization (ovirt) inventory source requests are secure by default.
To change this default setting, set the key `ovirt_insecure` to *true* in `source_variables`, which is only available from the API details of the inventory source at the `/api/v2/inventory_sources/N/` endpoint.
