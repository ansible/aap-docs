= Gathering {PlatformNameShort} logs

[role="_abstract"]
With the `sos` utility, you can collect configuration, diagnostic, and troubleshooting data, and give those files to Red Hat Technical Support. 

An `sos` report is a common starting point for Red Hat technical support engineers when performing analysis of a service request for the {PlatformNameShort}. 

As part of the troubleshooting with Red Hat Support, you can collect the `sos` report for each node in your RPM-based installation of {PlatformNameShort} using the installation inventory and the installation program.

.Procedure

. Access the installation program folder with the inventory file and run the installation program setup script the following command:
+
`$ ./setup.sh -s`
+
With this command, you can connect to each node present in the inventory, install the `sos` tool, and generate new logs.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are running the setup as a non-root user with sudo privileges, you can use the following command:
----
$ ANSIBLE_BECOME_METHOD='sudo'
ANSIBLE_BECOME=True ./setup.sh -s
---- 
====

. _Optional_: If required, change the location of the `sos` report files.
+
The `sos` report files are copied to the `/tmp` folder for the current server. To change the location, specify the new location by using the following command:
+
----
$ ./setup.sh -e 'target_sos_directory=/path/to/files' -s
----
+
Where `target_sos_directory=/path/to/files` is used to specify the destination directory where the `sos` report will be saved. In this case, the `sos` report is stored in the directory `/path/to/files`.

. Gather the files described on the playbook output and share with the support engineer or directly upload the `sos` report to Red Hat. 
+
To create an `sos` report with additional information or directly upload the data to Red Hat, use the following command:
+
----
$ ./setup.sh -e 'case_number=0000000' -e 'clean=true' -e 'upload=true' -s
----
