= {OperatorResourceShort} overview
{OperatorResourceShort} is a custom resource (CR) that you can deploy after you have created your {ControllerName} deployment.
 With {OperatorResourceShort} you can define projects, job templates, and inventories through the use of YAML files. 
 These YAML files are then used by {ControllerName} to create these resources. 
 You can create the YAML through the *Form view* that prompts you for keys and values for your YAML code. 
 Alternatively, to work with YAML directly, you can select *YAML view*. 

There are currently two custom resources provided by the {OperatorResourceShort}:

* AnsibleJob: launches a job in the {ControllerName} instance specified in the Kubernetes secret ({ControllerName} host URL, token).
* JobTemplate: creates a job template in the {ControllerName} instance specified.
