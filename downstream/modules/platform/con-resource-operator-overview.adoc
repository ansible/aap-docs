= {OperatorResourceShort} overview

{OperatorResourceShort} is a custom resource (CR) that you can deploy after you have created your {Gateway} deployment.
With {OperatorResourceShort} you can define resources such as projects, job templates, and inventories in YAML files. 
{ControllerName} then uses the YAML files to create these resources. 
You can create the YAML through the *Form view* that prompts you for keys and values for your YAML code. 
Alternatively, to work with YAML directly, you can select *YAML view*. 

The {OperatorResourceShort} provides the following CRs:

* AnsibleJob
* JobTemplate
* {ControllerNameStart} project
* {ControllerNameStart} schedule
* {ControllerNameStart} workflow
* {ControllerNameStart} workflow template:
* {ControllerNameStart} inventory
* {ControllerNameStart} credential

For more information on any of the above custom resources, see link:{URLControllerUserGuide}[{TitleControllerUserGuide}].
