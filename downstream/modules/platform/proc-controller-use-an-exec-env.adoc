= Adding an {ExecEnvShort} to a job template

.Prerequisites

* An {ExecEnvShort} must have been created using ansible-builder as described in xref:ref-controller-building-exec-env[Build an {ExecEnvShort}].
When an {ExecEnvShort} has been created, you can use it to run jobs.
Use the {ControllerName} UI to specify the {ExecEnvShort} to use in your job templates.
* Depending on whether an {ExecEnvShort} is made available for global use or tied to an organization, you must have the appropriate level of administrator privileges to use an {ExecEnvShort} in a job.
Execution environments tied to an organization require Organization administrators to be able to run jobs with those {ExecEnvShort}s.
* Before running a job or job template that uses an {ExecEnvShort} that has a credential assigned to it, ensure that the credential contains a username, host, and password.

.Procedure
. From the navigation panel, select {MenuInfrastructureExecEnvironments}.
. Click btn:[Create execution environment] to add an {ExecEnvShort}.
. Enter the appropriate details into the following fields:

* *Name* (required): Enter a name for the {ExecEnvShort}.
* *Image* (required): Enter the image name.
The image name requires its full location (repository), the registry, image name, and version tag in the example format of `quay.io/ansible/awx-ee:latestrepo/project/image-name:tag`.
* Optional: *Pull*: Choose the type of pull when running jobs:

** *Always pull container before running*: Pulls the latest image file for the container.
** *Only pull the image if not present before running*: Only pulls the latest image if none is specified.
** *Never pull container before running*: Never pull the latest version of the container image.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you do not set a type for pull, the value defaults to *Only pull the image if not present before running*.
====
+
* Optional: *Description*:
* Optional: *Organization*: Assign the organization to specifically use this {ExecEnvShort}. To make the {ExecEnvShort} available for use across multiple organizations, leave this field blank.
* *Registry Credential*: If the image has a protected container registry, give the credential to access it.
