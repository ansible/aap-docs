= HCP Terraform credential type

[role="_abstract"]

{TerraformCloudShortName} is a HashiCorp tool used to automate various infrastructure tasks. When using the `hashicorp.terraform` collection, the **HCP Terraform** credential type allows users to store TFE/C tokens and hostnames, which are then injected as environment variables for Ansible playbooks. This helps ensure that credentials are provided automatically to the execution environment, eliminating the need to update playbooks manually.
