= Build images for VMware vSphere

[role="_abstract"]

When building operating system images and disk images for VMware vSphere, you can follow the generic image building process with the following changes:

* Using late binding by injecting the enrollment certificate or the agent configuration through `cloud-init` when provisioning the virtual device.
* Adding the `open-vm-tools` guest tools to the image.
* Building a disk image of type `vmdk` instead of `iso`.

Complete the generic steps with changes to the following steps:

.Procedure

. Build an operating system image based on RHEL 9 that includes the {RedHatEdge} agent and VM guest tools but excludes the agent configuration.

. Create a file named `Containerfile` with the following content:

+
[source,bash]
----
FROM registry.redhat.io/rhel9/bootc-image-builder:latest
RUN subscription-manager repos --enable ansible-automation-platform-2.5-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms
    dnf -y install flightctl-agent && \
    dnf -y clean all && \
    systemctl enable flightctl-agent.service && \
RUN dnf -y install cloud-init open-vm-tools && \
    dnf -y clean all && \
    ln -s ../cloud-init.target /usr/lib/systemd/system/default.target.wants && \
    systemctl enable vmtoolsd.service
----

. Create a directory called `output` by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p output
----

. Generate an operating system disk image of type `vmdk` from your operating system image by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo podman run --rm -it --privileged --pull=newer \
    --security-opt label=type:unconfined_t \
    -v "${PWD}/output":/output \
    -v /var/lib/containers/storage:/var/lib/containers/storage \
    registry.redhat.io/rhel9/bootc-image-builder:latest \
    --type vmdk \
    ${OCI_IMAGE_REPO}:${OCI_IMAGE_TAG}
----

.Next steps
When the `bootc-image-builder` completes, you can find the disk image under `${PWD}/output/vmdk/disk.vmdk`.
