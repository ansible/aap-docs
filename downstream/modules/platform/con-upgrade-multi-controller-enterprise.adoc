= Upgrading a 2.4 multi node {ControllerName} deployment to a {PlatformVers} {EnterpriseTopology}

[role="_abstract"]
You can upgrade your 2.4 multi node {ControllerName} deployment to a {PlatformVers} {EnterpriseTopology}. This section outlines the infrastructure changes, requirements, and an example inventory for upgrading.

== 2.4 infrastructure topology diagram

This diagram outlines the 2.4 infrastructure topology that Red Hat has tested with this deployment model.

== Requirements for upgrading a multi {ControllerName} node deployment

The following table highlights the requirements for upgrading from {PlatformNameShort} version 2.4 to {PlatformVers}.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|====
|Existing 2.4 topology |Tested {PlatformVers} topology |Requirements for each VM

a|Redundant controller-only deployment:

* Two {ControllerName} VMs
* One {AutomationMesh} hop node VM
* Two {AutomationMesh} execution node VMs
* One customer-provided (external) {PostgresVers} database
* One HA proxy load balancer in front of {ControllerName}

a|Enterprise topology:

* Two {Gateway} with colocated Redis VMs
* Two {ControllerName} VMs
* Two {PrivateHubName} with colocated Redis VMs
* Two {EDAcontroller} with colocated Redis VMs
* One {AutomationMesh} hop node VM
* Two {AutomationMesh} execution node VMs
* One customer-provided (external) {PostgresVers} database
* One HA proxy load balancer in front of {Gateway}

*Note*: Redis high availability requires 6 VMs. Redis can be colocated with {HubName}, {Gateway}, or {EDAName} components, but it cannot be colocated with {ControllerName}, execution nodes, or the PostgreSQL database.
