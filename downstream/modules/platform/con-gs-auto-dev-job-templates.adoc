= Work with job templates

A job template is a definition and set of parameters for running an Ansible job.

A job template combines an Ansible playbook from a project and the settings required to launch it, including information about the target host against which the playbook will run, authentication information to access the host, and any other relevant variables . Job templates are useful to run the same job many times. Job templates also encourage the reuse of Ansible playbook content and collaboration between teams. For more information, see Job Templates in the Automation controller User Guide.
