= Displaying roles

[role="_abstract"]

You can display the roles assigned to each component resource from the menu:Access Management[] menu.

Roles are labeled with their associated {PlatformNameShort} component and function. These components align with {PlatformNameShort} services and the side navigation structure in the user interface. Component labels can be understood as follows: 

* *Automation Execution* refers to {ControllerName}
* *Automation Decisions* refers to {EDAName}
* *Automation Content* refers to {HubName}

Roles created at the level of the organization can be associated with multiple components because they group together permissions from {ControllerName} (Automation Execution) and {EDAName} (Automation Decisions). Only organization roles can span multiple components.

A similar role entity for Automation Content is a "system" role, which gives access to all of the specified resource types in Automation Content.

.Procedure

. From the navigation panel, select {MenuAMRoles}.
. From the table header, you can sort the list of roles by using the arrows for *Name*, *Description*, *Component*, *Resource Type*, and *Role Creation*, or by making sort selections in the *Sort* list.
. You can filter the list of roles by selecting *Name*, *Editable*, or *Component* from the filter list and clicking the arrow.
