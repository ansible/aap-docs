= Creating Red Hat Insights credentials

[role="_abstract"]
To create a Red Hat Insights credential, use the following procedure:

//.Prerequisites

//[emcwhinn - commenting out the following Insights content until it has been confirmed [AAP-36066]]
//* To use token-based authentication, you must link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_hybrid_cloud_console/1-latest/html/creating_and_managing_service_accounts/proc-ciam-svc-acct-overview-creating-service-acct#proc-ciam-svc-acct-create-creating-service-acct[create a Red Hat service account] to generate a *Client ID* and *Client secret*. 
//* Assign this service account to the appropriate *User Access* group with necessary permissions. 

//To enable integration between {PlatformNameShort} and {InsightsShort}, assign the service account with the following permissions:

//* *inventory:hosts:read* (included in the Inventory Hosts viewer role)
//* *patch::read* (included in the Patch viewer role)
//* *remediations:remediation:read* and *playbook-dispatcher:run:read* (included in the Remediations user role)

//You might consider associating your service account to an existing user access group with required permissions, or creating a new one. 

//[NOTE]
//====
//In adherence to security guidelines, service accounts are not automatically included in the default access group. 
//To grant access, you must manually add them to the appropriate user access groups.

//If you are not an Organization Administrator, you can create a service account and then ask your administrator to add your account to the appropriate user access ///groups.
//====

//Use the following procedure to create a new credential for use with {InsightsShort}:

.Procedure

. From the navigation panel, select {MenuAECredentials}.
. Click btn:[Create credential].
. Enter the appropriate details in the following fields:

* *Name*: Enter the name of the credential.
* Optional: *Description*: Enter a description for the credential.
* Optional: *Organization*: Enter the name of the organization with which the credential is associated, or click the search image:search.png[Search,15,15] icon and select it from the *Select organization* window.
* *Credential type*: Enter *Insights* or select it from the list.
+
image::ug-credential-types-popup-window-insights.png[Credentials insights pop up]
+
* *Username*: Enter a valid Red Hat Insights credential. 
* *Password*: Enter a valid Red Hat Insights credential.
+
The {InsightsShort} credentials are the user's link:https://access.redhat.com/[Red Hat Customer Portal] account username and password.
//+
//[NOTE]
//====
//Use the *Username* and *Password* fields for Basic authentication. 
//You can leave it blank if using *Client ID* and *Client secret*.
//====
//+
//* *Client ID*: Enter the client ID you received when you created your service account. 
//* *Client secret*: Enter the client secret you received when you created your service account. 

. Click btn:[Create credential].
//+
//You can now use this credential in an xref:proc-controller-inv-source-insights[{InsightsShort}-sourced inventory] and xref:controller-create-insights-project[{InsightsShort} project].

//.Troubleshooting

//* If you receive a project sync failure, see the steps in xref:controller-remediate-insights-inventory[Remediating a Red Hat Insights inventory] and check your analytics logs.

//[IMPORTANT]
//====
//* You must recreate existing credentials and reassociate them with existing projects and inventory sources to support token-based authentication.
//Note: The following is true for now, but there is a plan to fix this come Q3 or Q4. 
//* Only remediations you create using the service account are visible in {PlatformNameShort} for that account. 
//This aligns with the current policy, which does not allow a user to view remediations created by other users.
