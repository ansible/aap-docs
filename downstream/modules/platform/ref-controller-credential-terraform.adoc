= Terraform: Backend configuration

[role="_abstract"]
Terraform is a HashiCorp tool used to automate various infrastructure tasks. 
Select this credential type to enable synchronization with the Terraform inventory source.

The Terraform credential requires the *Backend configuration* attribute which must contain the data from a link:https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/backend[Terraform backend block]. Saving it stores the file path to the backend configuration in an environment variable `TF_BACKEND_CONFIG_FILE` that is made available to any job with the credential attached.

You can paste, drag a file, browse to upload a file, or click the image:leftkey.png[Key,15,15] icon to populate the field from an external link:{URLControllerAdminGuide}/assembly-controller-secret-management[Secret Management System].

Terraform backend configuration requires the following inputs:

* *Name*
* Credential type: Select *Terraform backend configuration*.
* Optional: *Organization*
* Optional: *Description* 
* *Backend configuration*: Drag a file here or browse to upload.
