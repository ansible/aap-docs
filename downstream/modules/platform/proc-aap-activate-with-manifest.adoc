= Activate with a manifest file

If you have a subscriptions manifest, you can upload the manifest file either by using the {PlatformName} interface or manually in an Ansible Playbook.

[Note]
====
You are opted in for {Analytics} by default when you activate the platform on first time log in. This helps Red Hat improve the product by delivering you a much better user experience. You can opt out, after activating {PlatformNameShort}, by doing the following: 

. From the navigation panel, select menu:[Settings] and select the *Miscellaneous System settings* option.
. Click btn:[Edit].
. Toggle the *Gather data for Automation Analytics* switch to the off position.
. Click btn:[Save].
====

.Prerequisites
You must have a Red Hat Subscription Manifest file exported from the Red Hat Customer Portal. For more information, see xref:assembly-aap-obtain-manifest-files[Obtaining a manifest file].

.Uploading with the interface

. Complete steps to generate and download the manifest file
. Log in to {PlatformName}.
//[ddacosta] There is no license setting in the test environment for 2.4? Need to verify this selection. In 2.5, I think it will be Settings[Subscription]...
. If you are not immediately prompted for a manifest file, go to menu:Settings[] and select the *License* option.
. Make sure the *Username* and *Password* fields are empty.
. Click btn:[Browse] and select the manifest file.
. Click btn:[Next].
. Review the End User License Agreement and select *I agree to the End User License Agreement*.
. Click btn:[Submit].
. Once your subscription has been accepted, the license screen displays and navigates you to the Dashboard of the {PlatformNameShort} interface. You can return to the license screen by clicking the btn:[Settings] icon *âš™* and selecting the *License* option from the Settings screen.

[NOTE]
====
If the btn:[BROWSE] button is disabled on the License page, clear the *USERNAME* and *PASSWORD* fields.

.Uploading manually

If you are unable to apply or update the subscription information by using the {PlatformName} interface, you can upload the subscriptions manifest manually in an Ansible Playbook by using the `license` module in the `ansible.controller` collection.
