= Activate with a manifest file

[role="_abstract"]

If you have a subscriptions manifest, you can upload the manifest file either by using the {PlatformName} interface. 

You are opted in for {Analytics} by default when you activate the platform on first time log in. This helps Red Hat improve the product by delivering you a much better user experience. However, you can opt out of {Analytics} after the {PlatformNameShort} is activated. To opt out, select {MenuSetSystem} from the navigation panel, uncheck the *Gather data for {Analytics}* option, and then click btn:[Save].
