= Activate with a manifest file

If you have a subscriptions manifest, you can upload the manifest file either by using the {PlatformName} interface or manually in an Ansible Playbook.

.Prerequisites
You must have a Red Hat Subscription Manifest file exported from the Red Hat Customer Portal. For more information, see xref:assembly-aap-obtain-manifest-files[Obtaining a manifest file].

.Uploading with the interface

. Complete steps to generate and download the manifest file
. Log in to {PlatformName}.
//[ddacosta] There is no license setting in the test environment for 2.4? Need to verify this selection. In 2.5, I think it will be Settings[Subscription]...
. If you are not immediately prompted for a manifest file, go to {MenuSetSubscription}.
. Select *Subscription manifest*.
. Click btn:[Browse] and select the manifest file.
. The Automation Analytics option is checked by default. These selections help Red Hat improve the product by delivering you a much better user experience. You can opt out by deselecting the options.
. Review the End User License Agreement and select *I agree to the End User License Agreement*.
. Click btn:[Finish].

[NOTE]
====
If the btn:[BROWSE] button is disabled on the License page, clear the *USERNAME* and *PASSWORD* fields.

.Uploading manually

If you are unable to apply or update the subscription information by using the {PlatformName} interface, you can upload the subscriptions manifest manually in an Ansible Playbook by using the `license` module in the `ansible.controller` collection.
