= Authenticator map examples

Use the following examples to explore the different conditions, like groups and attribute values you can implement to control user access to the platform. 

.Add users to an organization based on an attribute
In this example, you will add a user to the *Networking* organization if they have an `Organization` attribute with the value of `Networking`:

.Add users to a team based on the users group
In this example, you will add user to the `Apple` team if they have either of the following  groups:

-----
cn=Administrators,ou=AAP,ou=example,o=com
-----

or

-----
cn=Operators,ou=AAP,ou=example,co=com
-----

.Do not escalate privileges

In this example, you will never escalate users to a superuser. But note, this rule will not revoke a user’s superuser permission because the revoke option is not set.

.Escalate privileges based on a user having a group

In this example, you will escalate user privileges to superuser if they belong to the following group:

-----
cn=Administrators,ou=AAP
-----

.Using mapping order to create exceptions

Since maps are executed in order, it is possible to create exceptions. Expanding on the previous example for “Do not escalate privileges”, you can add another rule with a higher order, such as, “Escalate privileges”. 

The first rule (Do not escalate privileges) prevents any user from being escalated to a superuser, but the second rule (Escalate privileges) alters that decision to grant superuser privileges to a user if they are in the `Administrators` group.
