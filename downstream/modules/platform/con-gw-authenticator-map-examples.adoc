= Authenticator map examples

Use the following examples to explore the different conditions, like groups and attribute values you can implement to control user access to the platform. 

*Add users to an organization based on an attribute*

In this example, you will add a user to the *Networking* organization if they have an `Organization` attribute with the value of `Networking`:

. The *Organization* title of the page indicates that you are configuring settings permissions on an organization.
. `Network Organization` is entered in this field and is the unique, descriptive name for this map configuration.
. *Attributes* is selected from the *Trigger* list to configure authentication based on an attribute from the source system, which in this example is `Organization`.
. The operation is defined as `or` meaning that at least one condition must be true for authentication to succeed. 
. The *Attribute* coming from the source system is Organization.
. The *Comparison* value is set to `matches` which means that when a user has the attribute *Value* of `Networking`, they are added to the *Networking* organization.
. The attribute *Value* coming from the source system is `Networking`.
. The name of the *Organization* to which you are adding members is `Networking`.
. Users are added to the *Networking* organization with the `Organization Member` role.

*Add users to a team based on the users group*

In this example, you will add user to the `Apple` team if they have either of the following  groups:

-----
cn=administrators,ou=aap,ou=example,o=com
-----

or

-----
cn=operators,ou=aap,ou=example,co=com
-----

*Do not escalate privileges*

In this example, you never escalate users to a superuser. But note, this rule does not revoke a user’s superuser permission because the revoke option is not set.

*Escalate privileges based on a user having a group*

In this example, you escalate user privileges to superuser if they belong to the following group:

-----
cn=administrators,ou=aap
-----

*Using mapping order to create exceptions*

Since maps are executed in order, it is possible to create exceptions. Expanding on the previous example for __Do not escalate privileges__, you can add another rule with a higher order, such as, __Escalate privileges__. 

The first rule (__Do not escalate privileges__) prevents any user from being escalated to a superuser, but the second rule (__Escalate privileges__) alters that decision to grant superuser privileges to a user if they are in the `Administrators` group.
