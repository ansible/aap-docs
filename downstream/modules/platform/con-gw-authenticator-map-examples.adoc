= Authenticator map examples

Use the following examples to explore the different conditions, like groups and attribute values you can implement to control user access to the platform. 

.Add users to an organization based on an attribute
In this example, you will add a user to the *Networking* organization if they have an `Organization` attribute with the value of `Networking`:

. The *Organization* title of the page indicates that you are configuring settings permissions on an organization.
. `Network Organization` is entered in this field and is the unique, descriptive name for this map configuration.
. *Attributes* is selected from the *Trigger* list to configure authentication based on an attribute from the source system, which in this example is `Organization`.
. The operation is defined as `or` meaning that at least one condition must be true for authentication to succeed. 
. The *Attribute* coming from the source system is Organization.
. The *Comparison* value is set to `matches` which means that when a user has the attribute *Value* of `Networking`, they are added to the *Networking* organization.
. The attribute *Value* coming from the source system is `Networking`.
. The name of the *Organization* to which you are adding members is `Networking`.
. Users are added to the *Networking* organization with the `Organization Member` role.

.Add users to a team based on the users group
In this example, you will add user to the `Apple` team if they have either of the following  groups:

-----
cn=Administrators,ou=AAP,ou=example,o=com
-----

or

-----
cn=Operators,ou=AAP,ou=example,co=com
-----

.Do not escalate privileges

In this example, you never escalate users to a superuser. But note, this rule does not revoke a userâ€™s superuser permission because the revoke option is not set.

.Escalate privileges based on a user having a group

In this example, you escalate user privileges to superuser if they belong to the following group:

-----
cn=Administrators,ou=AAP
-----

.Using mapping order to create exceptions

Since maps are executed in order, it is possible to create exceptions. Expanding on the previous example for __Do not escalate privileges__, you can add another rule with a higher order, such as, __Escalate privileges__. 

The first rule (__Do not escalate privileges__) prevents any user from being escalated to a superuser, but the second rule (__Escalate privileges__) alters that decision to grant superuser privileges to a user if they are in the `Administrators` group.
