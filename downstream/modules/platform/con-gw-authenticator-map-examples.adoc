= Authenticator map examples

Use the examples below to explore the different conditions, like groups and attribute values you can implement to control user access to the platform. 

.Make this user a superuser if they have an attribute called `aap_superuser` with a value of _true_

.Add this user to the `Apple` team if they have either the group `cn=Administrators,ou=AAP,ou=example,o=com` or `cn=Operators,ou=AAP,ou=example,o=com`

.Never allow access to the system if the user has an attribute called `disabled` with a value of _True_, _Yes_ or _Until Further Notice_

.Using mapping order to create exceptions

Since maps are executed in order, it is possible to create exceptions. Expanding on the previous example for “Never allow access to the system if the user has an attribute called disabled with a value of _True_, _Yes_ or _Until Further Notice_".

You can add another rule with a higher order, such as, “Allow access to the system for a `disabled` user if they are in the group `Emergency Contacts`.”

//image::am-allow-emergency-map-example.png[Allow in emergency mapping example]

The first rule (Never allow) prevents the disabled user from accessing the system, but the second rule (Allow in emergency) alters that decision to grant access to the system for the disabled user if they are in the `Emergency Contacts` group.
