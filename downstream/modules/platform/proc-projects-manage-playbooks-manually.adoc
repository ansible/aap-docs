= Managing playbooks manually

While integrating with Source Code Management (SCM) systems is generally recommended for version control and collaborative development, there may be instances where direct management of playbook files is necessary. 
This approach involves creating and organizing playbook directories and files on the local filesystem, ensuring proper ownership and permissions for execution.

.Procedure

* Create one or more directories to store playbooks under the Project Base Path, for example, `/var/lib/awx/projects/`.
* Create or copy playbook files into the playbook directory.
* Ensure that the playbook directory and files are owned by the same UNIX user and group that the service runs as.
* Ensure that the permissions are appropriate for the playbook directories and files.

.Troubleshooting

* If you have not added any Ansible Playbook directories to the base project path, an error message is displayed. 
Choose one of the following options to troubleshoot this error:
** Create the appropriate playbook directories and check out playbooks from your SCM.
** Copy playbooks into the appropriate playbook directories.
