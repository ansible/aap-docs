= Managing playbooks manually

.Procedure

* Create one or more directories to store playbooks under the Project Base Path, for example, `/var/lib/awx/projects/`.
* Create or copy playbook files into the playbook directory.
* Ensure that the playbook directory and files are owned by the same UNIX user and group that the service runs as.
* Ensure that the permissions are appropriate for the playbook directories and files.

.Troubleshooting

* If you have not added any Ansible Playbook directories to the base project path an error message is displayed. 
Choose one of the following options to troubleshoot this error:
** Create the appropriate playbook directories and check out playbooks from your (Source code management) SCM.
** Copy playbooks into the appropriate playbook directories.
