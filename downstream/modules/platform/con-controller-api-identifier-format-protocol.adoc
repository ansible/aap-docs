= Identifier format protocol

Resources are identifiable by their unique keys, which are tuples of resource fields. 
Every resource is guaranteed to have its primary key number alone as a unique key, but there might be many other unique keys. 
A resource can generate an identifier format and, therefore, have a named URL if it has at least one unique key that satisfies the following rules:

. The key must contain only fields that are either the `name` field, or text fields with a finite number of possible choices (such as credential type resource's `kind` field).
. The only permitted exceptional field that breaks the preceding rule is a many-to-one related field relating to a resource other than itself, which is also allowed to have a slug.

If there are resources `Foo` and `Bar`, both `Foo` and `Bar` contain a name field and a choice field that can only have values "yes" or "no". 
Additionally, resource `Foo` has a many-to-one field (a foreign key) relating to `Bar`, for example `fk`. 
`Foo` has a unique key tuple (`name`, `choice`, `fk`) and `Bar` has a unique key tuple (`name`, `choice`). 
`Bar` can have named URL because it satisfies the preceding first rule. 
`Foo` can also have named URL, even though it breaks the first rule, the extra field breaking rule number one is the `fk` field, which is many-to-one-related to `Bar` and `Bar` can have named URL.

For resources satisfying the rule number one, their human-readable unique identifiers are combinations of foreign key fields, delimited by `+`. 
In specific, resource `Bar` in the preceding example has slug format `<name>+<choice>`. 
Note that the field order matters in slug format and the `name` field always comes first if present, followed by the remaining fields arranged in lexicographic order of field name. 
For example, if `Bar` also has an `a_choice` field satisfying rule one and the unique key becomes (`name`, `choice`, `a_choice`), its slug format becomes `<name>+<a_choice>+<choice>`.

For resources satisfying rule number two, if traced back through the extra foreign key fields, the result is a tree of resources that identify objects of that resource. 
To generate the identifier format, each resource in the traceback tree generates its own part of the standalone format, using all fields but the foreign keys. 
Finally, all parts are combined by `++` in the following order:

* Put standalone format as the first identifier part.
* Recursively generate unique identifiers for each resource. 
The underlying resource is pointing to using a foreign key (a child of a traceback tree node).
* Treat generated unique identifiers as the rest of the identifier components. 
Sort them in lexicographic order of corresponding foreign keys.
* Combine all components together using `++` to generate the final identifier format.

When generating an identifier format for resource `Foo`, {ControllerName} generates the standalone formats, `<name>+<choice>` for `Foo` and `<fk.name>+<fk.choice>` for `Bar`, then combines them together to be `<name>+<choice>++<fk.name>+<fk.choice>`.

When generating identifiers according to the given identifier format, there are cases where a foreign key might point to nowhere. 
In this case, {ControllerName} substitutes the part of the format corresponding to the resource the foreign key should point to with an empty string. 
For example, if a `Foo` object has the `name ="alice"`, `choice ="yes",` but `fk field = None`, its resulting identifier is `alice+yes++`.
