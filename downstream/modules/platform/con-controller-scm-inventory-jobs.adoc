= SCM inventory jobs

[role="_abstract"]
When you synchronize an inventory source that is configured to use a source control management (SCM) system, such as Git, {ControllerName} creates and runs an SCM inventory job. This job pulls the latest inventory data from the SCM repository and updates the inventory in {ControllerName}.

SCM inventory jobs function similarly to standard inventory source update jobs, but they specifically handle the interaction with the SCM system. These jobs ensure that the inventory data in {ControllerName} remains up-to-date with the latest changes made in the SCM repository.

When an inventory sourced from an SCM, for example git, is executed, the results are displayed in the *Output* tab. 
If used, the Ansible CLI displays the same information. This can be useful for debugging.

// For AAP-45084, I need to confirm if the latest env shows the following options:
Use the navigation menu to btn:[Relaunch job], btn:[Cancel job], download image:download.png[Download,15,15] the job output, or delete image:delete-button.png[Delete,15,15] the job.
