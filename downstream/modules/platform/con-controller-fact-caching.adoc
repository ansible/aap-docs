= Fact caching

{ControllerNameStart} can store and retrieve facts on a per-host basis through an Ansible Fact Cache plugin.
This behavior is configurable on a per-job template basis.
Fact caching is turned off by default but can be enabled to serve fact requests for all hosts in an inventory related to the job running.
This enables you to use job templates with `--limit` while still having access to the entire inventory of host facts.
A global timeout setting that the plugin enforces per-host, can be specified (in seconds) by going to {MenuAEAdminSettings} and selecting *Job settings* from the *Jobs* option:

After launching a job that uses fact cache (`use_fact_cache=True`), each host's `ansible_facts` are all stored by the controller in the job's inventory.

The Ansible Fact Cache plugin that ships with {ControllerName} is enabled on jobs with fact cache enabled (`use_fact_cache=True`).

When a job that has fact cache enabled (`use_fact_cache=True`) has run, {ControllerName} restores all records for the hosts in the inventory.
Any records with update times newer than the currently stored facts per-host are updated in the database.

New and changed facts are logged through {ControllerName}'s logging facility.
Specifically, to the `system_tracking namespace` or logger.
The logging payload includes the following fields:

* `host_name`
* `inventory_id`
* `ansible_facts`

`ansible facts` is a dictionary of all Ansible facts for `host_name` in the {ControllerName} inventory, `inventory_id`.

[NOTE]
====
If a hostname includes a forward slash (/), fact cache does not work for that host.
If you have an inventory with 100 hosts and one host has a / in the name, the remaining 99 hosts still collect facts.
