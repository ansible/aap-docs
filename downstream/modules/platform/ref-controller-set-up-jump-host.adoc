= Configuring {ControllerName} to use jump hosts connecting to managed nodes

[role="_abstract"]
A jump host (also known as a bastion host) is an intermediary server through which connections to managed nodes are routed.
 
This setup enhances security by isolating the managed nodes from direct access
from the {ControllerName} server.
To configure {ControllerName} to use a jump host when connecting to managed nodes, you need to modify the SSH configuration used by Ansible.
This involves editing the SSH configuration file to specify the jump host details.

Credentials supplied by {ControllerName} do not flow to the jump host through ProxyCommand. 
They are only used for the end-node when the tunneled connection is set up.
