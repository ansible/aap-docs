[id="ref-controller-set-up-jump-host"]

= Configuring {ControllerName} to use jump hosts connecting to managed nodes

Credentials supplied by {ControllerName} do not flow to the jump host through ProxyCommand. 
They are only used for the end-node when the tunneled connection is set up.

== Configure a fixed user/keyfile in your SSH configuration file

You can configure a fixed user/keyfile in your SSH configuration file in the ProxyCommand definition that sets up the connection through the jump host. 

.Prerequisites
* Check whether all jump hosts are reachable from any node that establishes a SSH connection to the managed nodes, such as a Hybrid Controller or an Execution Node.

.Procedure
. Create an SSH configuration file `/var/lib/awx .ssh/config` on each node with the following details

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
Host jumphost.example.com
    Hostname jumphost.example.com
    User <jumphostuser>
    Port <jumphostport>
    IdentityFile ~.ssh/id_rsa
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p jumphost.example.com
----

* The code specifies the configuration required to connect to the jump host 'jumphost.example.com'
* {ControllerNameStart} establishes an SSH connection from each node to the managed nodes.
* Example values `jumphost.example.com`, `jumphostuser`, `jumphostport` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa` must be changed according to your environment
* Add a Host matching block to the already created SSH configuration file `/var/lib/awx/.ssh/config`` on the node, for example:
+ 
[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
Host 192.0.* 
   ...
----
+
* The `Host 192.0.*` line indicates that all hosts in that subnet use the settings defined in that block. 
Specifically all hosts in that subnet are accessed using the `ProxyCommand` setting and connect through `jumphost.example.com`
* If `Host *` is used to indicate that all hosts connect through the specified proxy, ensure that `jumphost.example.com` is excluded from that matching, for example:
+
[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
Host * !jumphost.example.com 
    ...

=== Using the {PlatformName} UI

.Procedure
. On the navigation panel, select {MenuSetJob}
. Click btn:[Edit] and add `/var/lib/awx .ssh:/home/runner/.ssh:0` to the *Paths to expose isolated jobs* field.
. Click btn:[Save] to save your changes.

== Configuring jump hosts using Ansible Inventory variables

You can also add a jump host to your {ControllerName} instance through Inventory variables. 

These variables can be set at either the inventory, group, or host level. 
Use this method if you want to control the use of jump hosts inside {ControllerName} using the inventory.

* Navigate to your inventory and in the `variables` field of whichever level you choose, add the following
variables:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
ansible_user: <user_name>
ansible_connection: ssh
ansible_ssh_common_args: '-o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p -q <user_name>@<jump_server_name>"'
