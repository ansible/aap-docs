= Use source control

{ControllerNameStart} supports playbooks stored directly on the server. 
Therefore, you must store your playbooks, roles, and any associated details in source control. 
This way you have an audit trail describing when and why you changed the rules that are automating your infrastructure. 
Additionally, it permits sharing of playbooks with other parts of your infrastructure or team.
