= Configure authentication

[role="_abstract"]
After your first login as an administrator, begin configuring authentication for your users. 
Depending on your organization's needs and resources, you can either:

* Set up authentication by creating users, teams, and organizations, and then assigning them roles that govern access.
* Use an external source such as GitHub to configure authentication for your system.

The following sections serve as an introduction to authentication in {PlatformNameShort}. For more information on link:{URLCentralAuth}/gw-configure-authentication[external authentication] or using link:{URLCentralAuth}/gw-managing-access[role-based access control], see the link:{LinkCentralAuth} guide.
