= Post installation steps for RPM-based install

You must complete post-install steps for setting up {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 with {EDAcontroller} 1.1 and {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 with {HubName} 4.9. 
The installation program does not handle the creation of decision environments and credentials in this scenario. 
See the following steps to complete the installation:
