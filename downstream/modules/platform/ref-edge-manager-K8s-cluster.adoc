= Secrets from a Kubernetes cluster

[role="_abstract"]

The {RedHatEdge} can query only the Kubernetes cluster that the {RedHatEdge} is running on for a Kubernetes secret.
You can write the content of that secret to a path on the device file system.

The Kubernetes Secret Provider takes the following parameters:

|===
|Parameter|Description
|`Name`|The name of the secret.

|`NameSpace`|The namespace of the secret.

|`MountPath`|The directory in the file system of the device to write the secret contents to.
|===

[NOTE]
====
The {RedHatEdge} needs permission to access secrets in the defined namespace.
For example, creating a `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` allows the `flightctl-worker` service account to get and list secrets in that namespace.
