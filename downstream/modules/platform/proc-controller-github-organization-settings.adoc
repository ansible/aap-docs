= Configuring GitHub organization authentication

[role="_abstract"]
When defining account authentication with either an organization or a team within an organization, you should use the specific organization and team settings. Account authentication can be limited by an organization and by a team within an organization.

You can also choose to permit all by specifying non-organization or non-team based settings.
You can limit users who can log in to the platform by limiting only those in an organization or on a team within an organization.

To set up social authentication for a GitHub organization, you must obtain an OAuth2 key and secret for a web application using the link:https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/installing-your-own-github-app[registering the new application with GitHub].

The OAuth2 key (Client ID) and secret (Client Secret) are used to supply the required fields in the UI. To register the application, you must supply it with your webpage URL, which is the Callback URL shown in the Authenticator details for your authenticator configuration. See xref:gw-display-auth-details[Displaying authenticator details] for instructions on accessing this information.
