= Configuring the Ansible {VSCode} extension

[role="_abstract"]
If you deployed the Ansible Lightspeed coding assistant, you must also configure the Ansible {VSCode} extension with the generated Ansible Lightspeed URL. 
This configuration enables the Ansible users in your organization to use the Ansible Lightspeed coding assistant to create Ansible content. 

.Prerequisites

* You have installed {VSCode} version 1.70.1 or later.
* Your organization administrator has configured an {ibmwatsonxcodeassistant} model for your organization.

.Procedure

. Open the {VSCode} application.
. From the Activity bar, click the *Extensions* icon image:extensions-icon-vscode.png[Extensions].
. From the Installed Extensions list, select *Ansible*.
. From the *Ansible* extension page, click the *Settings* icon and select *Extension Settings*. 
. Select *Ansible Lightspeed* settings, and specify the following information:
.. Ensure that the *Enable Ansible Lightspeed with watsonx Code Assistant inline suggestions* checkbox is selected.
.. In the *URL for Ansible Lightspeed* field, verify that you have the following URL: `\https://<node.ansible.com>:8447`. 
.. Select the *Enable Ansible Lightspeed with watsonx Code Assistant inline suggestions* checkbox.
. Optional: If you want to use the custom model instead of the default model, in the *Model ID Override* field, enter the custom model ID. The *model-override* setting enables you to override the default model and use the custom model, after your organization administrator has created a custom model and has shared the model ID with you separately. 
+
Your settings are automatically saved in {VSCode}.

[NOTE]
====
If your organization recently subscribed to the {PlatformName}, it might take a few hours for {LightspeedShortName} to detect the new subscription. In {VSCode}, use the *Refresh* button in the Ansible extension from the Activity bar to check again.
