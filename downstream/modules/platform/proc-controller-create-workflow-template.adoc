= Creating a workflow template

To create a new workflow job template, complete the following steps:

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you set a limit to a workflow template, it is not passed down to the job template unless you check *Prompt on launch* for the limit.
This can lead to playbook failures if the limit is mandatory for the playbook that you are running.
====

.Procedure

. On the *Templates* list view, select *Add workflow template* from the *Add* list.

+
. Enter the appropriate details in the following fields:
+
[NOTE]
====
If a field has the *Prompt on launch* checkbox selected, either launching the workflow template, or using the workflow template within another workflow template, you are prompted for the value for that field.
Most prompted values override any values set in the job template.
Exceptions are noted in the following table.
====
+
[cols="33%,33%,33%",options="header"]
|===
| *Field* | *Options* | *Prompt on Launch*
| Name | Enter a name for the job.| N/A
| Description| Enter an arbitrary description as appropriate (optional). | N/A
| Organization | Choose the organization to use with this template from the organizations available to the logged in user. | N/A
| Inventory | Optionally, select the inventory to use with this template from the inventories available to the logged in user. | Yes
| Limit a| A host pattern to further constrain the list of hosts managed or affected by the playbook. You can separate many patterns by colons (:). As with core Ansible:

- a:b means "in group a or b"
- a:b:&c means "in a or b but must be in c"
- a:!b means "in a, and definitely not in b"

For more information see, link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_patterns.html[Patterns: targeting hosts and groups ] in the Ansible documentation. | Yes

If selected, even if a default value is supplied, you are prompted upon launch to select a limit.
| Source control branch | Select a branch for the workflow. This branch is applied to all workflow job template nodes that prompt for a branch. | Yes
| Labels a| - Optionally, supply labels that describe this workflow job template, such as `dev` or `test`.
Use labels to group and filter workflow job templates and completed jobs in the display.

- Labels are created when they are added to the workflow template.
Labels are associated to a single Organization using the Project that is provided in the workflow template.
Members of the Organization can create labels on a workflow template if they have edit permissions (such as the admin role).

- Once you save the job template, the labels appear in the workflow job templates *Details* view.

- Labels are only applied to the workflow templates not the job template nodes that are used in the workflow.

- Select image:disassociate.png[Disassociate,10,10] beside a label to remove it.
When a label is removed, it is no longer associated with that particular Job or Job Template, but it remains associated with any other jobs that reference it.

a| Yes

If selected, even if a default value is supplied, you are prompted when launching to supply additional labels, if needed.
- You cannot delete existing labels, selecting image:disassociate.png[Disassociate,10,10] only removes the newly added labels, not existing default labels.
| Variables a| - Pass extra command line variables to the playbook.

This is the "-e" or "-extra-vars" command line parameter for ansible-playbook that is documented in the Ansible documentation at link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/general_precedence.html[Controlling how Ansible behaves: precedence rules].
- Provide key or value pairs by using either YAML or JSON. These variables have a maximum value of precedence and overrides other variables specified elsewhere. The following is an example value:
`git_branch: production
release_version: 1.5` | Yes

If you want to be able to specify extra_vars on a schedule, you must select *Prompt on launch* for Variables on the workflow job template, or enable a survey on the job template. Those answered survey questions become `extra_vars`.
For more information about extra variables, see xref:controller-extra-variables[Extra Variables].
| Job tags | Type and select the *Create* drop-down to specify which parts of the playbook should run.
For more information and examples see link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_tags.html[Tags] in the Ansible documentation. | Yes
| Skip Tags | Type and select the *Create* drop-down to specify certain tasks or parts of the playbook to skip.
For more information and examples see link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_tags.html[Tags] in the Ansible documentation. | Yes

. Specify the following *Options* for launching this template, if necessary:
* Check *Enable Webhooks* to turn on the ability to interface with a predefined SCM system web service that is used to launch a workflow job template.
GitHub and GitLab are the supported SCM systems.
** If you enable webhooks, other fields display, prompting for additional information:
*** *Webhook Service*: Select which service to listen for webhooks from.
*** *Webhook Credential*: Optionally, provide a GitHub or GitLab personal access token (PAT) as a credential to use to send status updates back to the webhook service.
For more information, see xref:ref-controller-credential-types[Credential Types] to create one.
+
** When you click btn:[Save], additional fields populate and the workflow visualizer automatically opens.
*** *Webhook URL*: Automatically populated with the URL for the webhook service to POST requests to.
*** *Webhook Key*: Generated shared secret to be used by the webhook service to sign payloads sent to {ControllerName}.
You must configure this in the settings on the webhook service so that webhooks from this service are accepted in {ControllerName}.
For additional information about setting up webhooks, see xref:controller-work-with-webhooks[Working with Webhooks].
+
Check *Enable Concurrent Jobs* to allow simultaneous runs of this workflow.
For more information, see xref:controller-capacity-determination[{ControllerNameStart} capacity determination and job impact].
+
. When you have completed configuring the workflow template, click btn:[Save].

Saving the template exits the workflow template page and the workflow visualizer opens to allow you to build a workflow.
For more information, see the xref:controller-workflow-visualizer[Workflow visualizer] section.
Otherwise, select one of these methods:

* Close the workflow visualizer to return to the *Details* tab of the newly saved template.
There you can complete the following tasks:

** Review, edit, add permissions, notifications, schedules, and surveys
** View completed jobs
** Build a workflow template

* Click btn:[Launch] to start the workflow.
+
[NOTE]
====
Save  the template before launching, or btn:[Launch] remains disabled.
The *Notifications* tab is only present after you save the template.
