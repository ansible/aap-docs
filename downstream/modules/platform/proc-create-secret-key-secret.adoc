= Creating a secret key secret

[role=_abstract]

To migrate your data to {OperatorPlatformNameShort} on {OCPShort}, you must create a secret key that matches the secret key defined in the inventory file during your initial installation.
Otherwise, the migrated data remains encrypted and unusable after migration.

.Procedure

. Locate the old secret key in the inventory file you used to deploy {PlatformNameShort} in your previous installation.
. Create a YAML file for your secret key:
+
-----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <resourcename>-admin-password
  namespace: <target-namespace>
stringData:
  password: mysuperlongpassword
type: Opaque
-----
+
[NOTE]
====
If `admin_password_secret` is not provided, the operator looks for a secret named `<resourcename>-admin-password` for the admin password.
If it is not present, the operator generates a password and create a secret from it named `<resourcename>-admin-password`.
====
+
. Apply the secret key yaml to the cluster:
+
-----
oc apply -f <secret-key.yml>
-----
