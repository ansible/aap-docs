[role="_abstract"]

Build, sign, and publish the `bootc` operating system image by following the generic image building process:

.Procedure

. Create a directory called `output` by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p output
----

. Generate an operating system disk image of type `vmdk` from your operating system image by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
sudo podman run --rm -it --privileged --pull=newer \
    --security-opt label=type:unconfined_t \
    -v "${PWD}/output":/output \
    -v /var/lib/containers/storage:/var/lib/containers/storage \
    registry.redhat.io/rhel9/bootc-image-builder:latest \
    --type qcow2 \
    ${OCI_IMAGE_REPO}:${OCI_IMAGE_TAG}
----

.Next steps
When the `bootc-image-builder` completes, you can find the disk image under `${PWD}/output/vmdk/disk.vmdk`.
