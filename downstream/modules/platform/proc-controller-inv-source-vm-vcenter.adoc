= VMware vCenter

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure {ControllerName} to synchronize inventory from a VMware vCenter server.
This enables you to manage virtual machines as part of your automation workflows.   

Use the following procedure to configure a VMWare-sourced inventory.

.Procedure
. From the navigation panel, select {MenuInfrastructureInventories}.
. Select the inventory name you want a source to and click the *Sources* tab.
. Click btn:[Create source].
. In the *Create source* page, select *VMware vCenter* from the *Source* list.
. The *Create source* window expands with additional fields.
Enter the following details:

* Optional: *Credential*: Choose from an existing VMware credential.
For more information, see xref:controller-credentials[Managing user credentials].

. Optional: You can specify the verbosity, host filter, enabled variables or values, and update options as described in xref:proc-controller-add-source[Adding a source].
. Use the *Source Variables* field to override variables used by the `vmware_inventory` inventory plugin.
Enter variables by using either JSON or YAML syntax.
Use the radio button to toggle between the two.
For more information about these variables, see the link:https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.vmware/blob/main/plugins/inventory/vmware_vm_inventory.py[vmware_inventory inventory plugin].

.Troubleshooting

VMWare properties have changed from lower case to camel case.
{ControllerNameStart} provides aliases for the top-level keys, but lower case keys in nested properties have been discontinued.
For a list of valid and supported properties, see link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/4/scenario_guides/vmware_scenarios/vmware_inventory_vm_attributes.html[Using Virtual machine attributes in VMware dynamic inventory plugin].
