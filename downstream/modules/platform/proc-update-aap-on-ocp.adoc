= Patch updating {PlatformNameShort} on {OCPShort}

When you perform a patch update for an installation of {PlatformNameShort} on {OCPShort}, most updates happen within a channel:

. A new update becomes available in the marketplace (through the redhat-operator CatalogSource).

. A new InstallPlan is automatically created for your {PlatformNameShort} subscription. If the subscription is set to Manual, the InstallPlan must be manually approved in the OpenShift UI. If the subscription is set to Automatic, it upgrades as soon as the new version is available.
+
[NOTE]
====
It is recommended that you set a manual install strategy on your {OperatorPlatformNameShort} subscription (set when installing or upgrading the Operator) and you will be prompted to approve an upgrade when it becomes available in your selected update channel. Stable channels for each X.Y release (for example, stable-2.5) are available.
====
+
. A new Subscription, CSV, and Operator containers will be created alongside the old Subscription, CSV, and containers. Then the old resources will be cleaned up if the new install was successful.
