= Define events with rulebooks

An Ansible rulebook is a collection of rulesets that references one or more sources, rules, and conditions.

Rulebooks are to {EDAName} what playbooks are to {PlatformNameShort} as a whole. 
Like a playbook, a rulebook defines automation tasks for the platform, along with when they should be triggered. 

== Rulebook actions

Rulebooks use an "if-this-then-that‚Äù logic that tells {EDAName} what actions to activate when a rule is triggered. {EDAName} listens to the controller event stream and, when an event triggers a rule, activates an automation action in response. 

Rulebooks can trigger the following activations:

* `run_job_template`
* `run_playbook` (only supported with ansible-rulebook CLI)
* `debug`
* `print_event`
* `set_fact`
* `post_event`
* `retract_fact`
* `shutdown`

To read more about rulebook activations, see link:https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/rulebook/en/latest/actions.html[Actions] in the Ansible Rulebook documentation.
