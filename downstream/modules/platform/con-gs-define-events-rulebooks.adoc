= Define events with rulebooks

An Ansible rulebook is a collection of rulesets that references one or more sources, rules, and conditions.

Rulebooks are to Event-Driven Ansible what playbooks are to {PlatformNameShort} as a whole. 
Like a playbook, a rulebook defines automation tasks for the platform, along with when they should be triggered. 

== Rulebook actions

Rulebooks use an "if-this-then-that‚Äù logic that tells {EDAName} what actions to activate when a rule is triggered.
