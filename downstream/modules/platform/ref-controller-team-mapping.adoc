= Team mapping

Team mapping is the mapping of team members (users) from social authentication accounts. 
Keys are team names (which are created if not present). 
Values are dictionaries of options for each team's membership, where each can contain the following parameters:

* *organization*: String. The name of the organization to which the team belongs. 
The team is created if the combination of organization and team name does not exist. 
The organization is created first if it does not exist. 
If the license does not permit multiple organizations, the team is always assigned to the single default organization.

* *users*: None, True/False, string or list/tuple of strings.

*** If *None*, team members are not updated.
*** If *True*, all social authentication users are added as team members.
*** If *False*, all social authentication users are removed as team members.
* If a string or list of strings, specifies expressions used to match users, the user is added as a team member if the username or email matches. 
Strings beginning and ending with `/` are compiled into regular expressions.
The modifiers `i` (case-insensitive) and `m` (multi-line) can be specified after the ending `/`.

*remove*: True/False. Defaults to *True*. When *True*, a user who does not match the preceding rules is removed from the team.

Team mappings can be specified separately for each account authentication backend, based on which of these you set up. 
When defined, these configurations take precedence over the preceding global configuration.

Only users who have previously logged in to {ControllerName} using social or enterprise-level authentication, or have a user account with a matching email address can then login.
