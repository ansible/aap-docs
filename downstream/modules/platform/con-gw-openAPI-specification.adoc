= Understanding the {Gateway} OpenAPI specification

[role="_abstract"]
{GatewayStart} serves as the single entry point for {PlatformNameShort}, unifying the user interface and routing all API traffic to services such as {ControllerName}, {EDAName}, and {HubName}.

The OpenAPI specification provides a standardized, machine-readable definition of the unified API endpoints available through {Gateway}. 
It is essential for external developers and automation engineers building reliable custom integrations.

*Key roles of the specification*

The OpenAPI specification ensures successful integration by fulfilling the following roles:

* *Enables custom integrations*: Developers use the specification to understand endpoint structures, required parameters, and response schemas, which is needed for building custom applications and third-party tools.
* *Ensures API longevity*: Integration with the {Gateway} API future-proofs custom applications against disruptions that might occur when legacy, direct-access component APIs are retired.
* *Defines core functions*: The specification details endpoints that support fundamental operational and administrative functions, including:
** Platform health, such as `/api/gateway/v1/status/`.
** Activity monitoring, such as `/api/gateway/v1/activitystream/`.
** Configuration management, such as authentication configuration and role-based access control assignments.
