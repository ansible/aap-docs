= Building the operating system image with _bootc_

Build the operating system image with the `bootc` that contains the {RedHatEdge} agent. 
You can optionally include the following items in your operating system image:

* The agent configuration for early binding
* Any drivers
* Host configuration
* Application workloads that you need

Complete the following steps:

.Procedure

. Create a `Containerfile` file with the following content to build a RHEL 9-based operating system image that includes the {RedHatEdge} agent and configuration:
//The following containerfile includes RHACM, confirm step for AAP.
+
[source,bash]
----
FROM registry.redhat.io/rhel9/rhel-bootc:<required_os_version> <1>
RUN subscription-manager repos --enable rhacm-2.13-for-rhel-9-$(uname -m)-rpms && \
    dnf -y install flightctl-agent && \
    dnf -y clean all && \
    systemctl enable flightctl-agent.service && \
    systemctl mask bootc-fetch-apply-updates.timer <2>
----
<1> The base image that is referenced in `FROM` is a bootable container (`bootc`) image that already has a Linux kernel, which allows you to reuse existing standard container build tools and workflows.
<2> Disables the default automatic updates. The updates are managed by the {RedHatEdge}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If your device relies on containers from a private repository, you must place the device pull secret in the `/etc/ostree/auth.json` path. 
The pull secret must exist on the device before the secret can be consumed.
====

** *Optional:* To enable `podman-compose` application support, add the following section to the `Containerfile` file:

+
[source,bash]
----
RUN dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-9.noarch.rpm && \
    dnf -y install podman-compose && \
    dnf -y clean all && \
    systemctl enable podman.service
----

** *Optional:* If you created the `config.yaml` for early binding, add the following section to the `Containerfile`:

+
[source,bash]
----
ADD config.yaml /etc/flightctl/
----

+

. Define the Open Container Initiative (OCI) registry by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
OCI_REGISTRY=registry.redhat.io
----

. Define the image repository that you have permissions to write to by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
OCI_IMAGE_REPO=${OCI_REGISTRY}/<your_org>/<your_image>
----

. Define the image tag by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
OCI_IMAGE_TAG=v1
----

. Build the operating system image for your target platform:

+
[source,bash]
----
sudo podman build -t ${OCI_IMAGE_REPO}:${OCI_IMAGE_TAG} .
