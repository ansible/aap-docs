= The MANAGE_ORGANIZATION_AUTH setting

The {ControllerName} setting previously called *Organization Admins Can Manage Users and Teams* in the UI (or `MANAGE_ORGANIZATION_AUTH` in the API) controls whether an organization administrator can create users and teams. 
This setting now exists in both {Gateway} and {ControllerName} in {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers}. 
During an upgrade the value from {ControllerName} is imported into the {Gateway} server. 
If you decide to change the value of this setting ensure that you change it to the same values in both {Gateway} and {ControllerName}. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
For environments with automation running directly against {ControllerName}, maintain a consistent value for `MANAGE_ORGANIZATION_AUTH` across both {ControllerName} and {Gateway} to avoid unexpected behavior.
