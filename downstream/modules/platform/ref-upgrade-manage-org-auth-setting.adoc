= The MANAGE_ORGANIZATION_AUTH setting

The `MANAGE_ORGANIZATION_AUTH` setting controls whether an organization administrator can create users and teams. This setting is now configured at {Gateway} level.

* *New installations*: This setting can be toggled in the platform UI. 
Changes only affect the {Gateway}, as UI operations are routed to {Gateway} endpoints.
* *Upgraded installations*: The value of the setting is migrated from your existing {ControllerName} configuration to the {Gateway}. 
After the migration, the values on {ControllerName} and the {Gateway} are not automatically kept in sync.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For environments with automation running directly against {ControllerName}, maintain a consistent value for `MANAGE_ORGANIZATION_AUTH` across both {ControllerName} and the {Gateway} to avoid unexpected behavior.
