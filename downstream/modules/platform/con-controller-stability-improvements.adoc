= Stability improvements

Notable stability improvements are:

*Improvements to job reaping*:: Fixed root cause of jobs in waiting being reaped before the job ever started, which often occurred when running near 100% capacity on control and hybrid nodes.
*Improvements in stability for Operator-based deployments*:: Resolved issues with multiple control pod deployments erroneously marking each
other as offline. Now scaling operator-based deployments horizontally is more stable.
