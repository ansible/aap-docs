= {PlatformNameShort} upgrade planning
 
[role="_abstract"]
Before you begin the upgrade process, review the following considerations to plan and prepare your {PlatformNameShort} deployment:

* See link:{URLPlanningGuide}/platform-system-requirements[System requirements] in the {TitlePlanningGuide} guide to ensure you have the topologies that fit your use case. 
+
[NOTE]
====
2.4 to 2.5 upgrades now include link:{URLPlanningGuide}/ref-aap-components#con-about-platform-gateway_planning[Platform gateway]. Ensure you review the 2.5 link:{URLPlanningGuide}/ref-network-ports-protocols_planning[Network ports and protocols] for architectural changes.
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
When upgrading from {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 to 2.5, the API endpoints for the {ControllerName}, {HubName}, and {EDAcontroller} are all available for use. These APIs are being deprecated and will be disabled in an upcoming release. This grace period is to allow for migration to the new APIs put in place with the {Gateway}.
====
+
* Verify that you have a valid subscription before upgrading from a previous version of {PlatformNameShort}. Existing subscriptions are carried over during the upgrade process. 
* Ensure you have a backup of an {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 environment before upgrading in case any issues occur. See link:{URLControllerAdminGuide}/controller-backup-and-restore[Backup and restore] and link:{LinkOperatorBackup} for the specific topology of the environment.
* Ensure you capture your inventory or instance group details before upgrading.
* Upgrades of {EDAName} version 2.4 to 2.5 are not supported. Database migrations between {EDAName} 2.4 and {EDAName} 2.5 are not compatible. For more information, see xref:upgrade-controller-hub-eda-unified-ui_aap-upgrading-platform[{ControllerName} and {HubName} 2.4 and {EDAName} 2.5 with unified UI upgrades].
+
If you are currently running {EDAcontroller} 2.5, it is recommended that you disable all {EDAName} activations before upgrading to ensure that only new activations run after the upgrade process is complete.
* {ControllerNameStart} OAuth applications on the platform UI are not supported for 2.4 to 2.5 migration. See this link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7091987[Knowledgebase article] for more information. To learn how to recreate your OAuth applications, see link:{URLCentralAuth}/gw-token-based-authentication#assembly-controller-applications[Applications] in the {TitleCentralAuth} guide.
* During the upgrade process, user accounts from the individual services are migrated. If there are accounts from multiple services, they must be linked to access the unified platform. See xref:account-linking_aap-upgrading-platform[Account linking] for details.
* {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 offers a centralized Redis instance in both link:{URLPlanningGuide}/ha-redis_planning#gw-single-node-redis_planning[standalone] and link:{URLPlanningGuide}/ha-redis_planning#gw-clustered-redis_planning[clustered] topologies. For information on how to configure Redis, see link:{URLInstallationGuide}/assembly-platform-install-scenario#redis-config-enterprise-topology_platform-install-scenario[Configuring Redis] in the {TitleInstallationGuide} guide.
