[id="edge-manager-success-threshold"]

= Success threshold

The `successThreshold` defines the percentage of successfully updated devices required to continue the rollout. 
If the success rate falls below this threshold, the rollout might be paused to prevent further failures.

.Example

The following shows an example YAML configuration for a fleet specification:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: v1alpha1
kind: Fleet
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      fleet: default
  rolloutPolicy:
    deviceSelection:
      strategy: 'BatchSequence'
      sequence:
        - selector:
            matchLabels:
              site: madrid
          limit: 1  # Absolute number
        - selector:
            matchLabels:
              site: madrid
          limit: 80%  # Percentage of devices matching the label criteria within the fleet
        - limit: 50%  # Percentage of all devices in the fleet
        - selector:
            matchLabels:
              site: paris
        - limit: 80%
        - limit: 100%
    successThreshold: 95%
----

In this example, there are 6 explicit batches and 1 implicit batch:

* The first batch selects 1 device having a label *site:madrid*.
* With the second batch 80% of all devices having the label *site:madrid* are either selected for rollout in the current batch or were previously selected for rollout.
* With the third batch 50% of all devices are either selected for rollout in the current batch or were previously selected for rollout.
* With the fourth batch all devices that were not previously selected and have the label *site:paris* are selected.
* With the fifth batch 80% of all devices are either selected for rollout in the current batch or were previously selected for rollout.
* With the sixth batch 100% of all devices are either selected for rollout in the current batch or were previously selected for rollout.
* The last implicit batch selects all devices that have not been selected in any previous batch (might be none).
