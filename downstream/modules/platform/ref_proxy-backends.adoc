= Proxy backends
For HTTP and HTTPS proxies you can use a squid server. 
Squid is a forward proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP, reducing bandwidth and improving response times by caching and reusing frequently-requested web pages. 
It is licensed under the GNU GPL. 
Forward proxies are systems that intercept network traffic going to another network (typically the internet) and send it on the behalf of the internal systems. 
The squid proxy enables all required communication to pass through it.

Make sure all the required {PlatformNameShort} control plane ports are opened on the squid proxy backend. {PlatformNameShort}-specific ports:

acl Safe_ports port 81
acl Safe_ports port 82
acl Safe_ports port 389
acl Safe_ports port 444
acl Safe_ports port 445
acl SSL_ports port 22
