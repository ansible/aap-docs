Passwords must be enclosed in quotes when they are provided in plain text in the inventory file.

* set `generate_automationhub_token` to `true` to generate a new token

Generating a new token invalidates the existing token.

| *`automationhub_auto_sign_collections`* | If a collection signing service is enabled, collections are not signed automatically by default.

Setting this parameter to `true` signs them by default.

Default = `false`.

{HubNameMain} provides artifacts in `/var/lib/pulp`.
{ControllerNameStart} automatically backs up the artifacts by default.

You can also set `automationhub_backup_collections` to false and the backup/restore process does not then backup or restore `/var/lib/pulp`.

Default = `true`.

| *`automationhub_ssl_validate_certs`* | For {PlatformName} 2.2 and later, this value is no longer used.

Set value to `true` if {HubName} must validate certificates when requesting itself because by default, {PlatformNameShort} deploys with self-signed certificates.

If set to `false`, {ExecEnvShort} images are also taken directly from Red Hat.

| *`generate_automationhub_token`* a| If upgrading from {PlatformName} 2.0 or earlier, choose one of the following options:

Generating a new token will invalidate the existing token.

The TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 parameters only work when OpenSSL 1.0.1 or higher is used.

The TLSv1.3 parameter only works when OpenSSL 1.1.1 or higher is used.

If `nginx_tls-protocols = ['TLSv1.3']` only TLSv1.3  is enabled.
