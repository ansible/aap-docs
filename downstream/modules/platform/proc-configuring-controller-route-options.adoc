= Configure {ControllerName} operator route options

[role="_abstract"]

The {OperatorPlatformName} installation form provides advanced options to configure your {ControllerName} operator route.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must assign a unique `metadata.name` to each custom resource (CR) in your namespace. If you assign an `AutomationControllerMeshIngress` the same name as your `{PlatformNameShort}` installation, the operator overrides default routes and services. This conflict causes the platform installation to fail.
====

.Procedure
. Log in to {OCP}.
. Navigate to *Operators → Installed Operators*.
. Select your *{OperatorPlatformNameShort}* deployment.
. Select the *{ControllerNameStart}* tab.
. Create or edit an instance:
.. For new instances, click *Create {ControllerNameStart}*.
.. For existing instances, click the *Options* icon and select *Edit {ControllerNameStart}*.
. Click *Advanced configuration*.
. In the *Ingress type* list, select *Route*.
. In the *Route DNS host* field, enter the common host name the route answers to.
. In the *Route TLS termination mechanism* list, select *Edge* or *Passthrough*. Edge is recommended for most instances.
. In the *Route TLS credential secret* list, select a secret.
. Use the slider to enable or disable persistence for the `/var/lib/projects` directory.

[NOTE]
====
After you configure your route, you can customize your hostname by adding `route_host:` to the YAML for that {ControllerName} instance.
