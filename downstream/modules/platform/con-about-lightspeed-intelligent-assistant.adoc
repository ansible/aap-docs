= Overview

[role="_abstract"]

The {AAPchatbot} is available on {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers} on {OCPShort} as a Technology Preview release. It is an intuitive chat interface embedded within the {PlatformNameShort}, utilizing generative artificial intelligence (AI) to answer questions about the {PlatformNameShort}. 

The {AAPchatbot} interacts with users in their natural language prompts in English, and uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate quick, accurate, and personalized responses. These responses empower Ansible users to work more efficiently, thereby improving productivity and the overall quality of their work. 

{AAPchatbot} requires the following configurations:

* Installation of {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers} on {OCP}
* Deployment of an LLM served by either a Red Hat AI platform or a third-party AI platform. To know the LLM providers that you can use, see xref:#LLMproviders[LLM providers]. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Red Hat does not collect any telemetry data from your interactions with the {AAPchatbot}. 
* {AAPchatbot} is available as a Technology Preview feature only.
+
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
+
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see  link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview Features Support Scope].

= Prerequisites

= {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers}

* You have installed {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers} on your {OCPShort} environment. 
* You have administrator privileges for the {PlatformNameShort}.
* You have provisioned an OpenShift cluster with Operator Lifecycle Management installed.

[#LLMproviders]
== Large Language Model (LLM) provider

You must have configured an LLM provider that you will use before deploying the {AAPchatbot}. 

An LLM is a type of machine learning model that can interpret and generate human-like language. When an LLM is used with the {AAPchatbot}, the LLM can interpret questions accurately and provide helpful answers in a conversational manner.

As part of the Technology Preview release, {AAPchatbot} can rely on the following Software as a Service (SaaS) LLM providers:

*Red Hat LLM providers*

* {RHELAI}
+
{RHELAI} is OpenAI API-compatible and is configured in a similar manner to the OpenAI provider. You can configure {RHELAI} as the LLM provider. For more information, see the link:https://www.redhat.com/en/products/ai/enterprise-linux-ai[{RHELAI}] product page.

* {OCPAI}
+
{OCPAI} is OpenAI API-compatible and is configured in a similar manner to the {OpenAI} provider. You can configure {OCPAI} as the LLM provider. For more information, see the link:https://www.redhat.com/en/products/ai/openshift-ai[{OCPAI}] product page.

[NOTE]
====
For configurations with {RHELAI} or {OCPAI}, you must host your own LLM provider instead of using a SaaS LLM provider. 
====

*Third-party LLM providers*

* {IBMwatsonxai}
+
To use IBM watsonx with the {AAPchatbot}, you need an account with link:https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai[{IBMwatsonxai}].

* {OpenAI}
+
To use {OpenAI} with the {AAPchatbot}, you need access the link:https://openai.com/api/[{OpenAI} API platform].

* {AzureOpenAI}
+
To use Microsoft Azure with the {AAPchatbot}, you need access to link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service[{AzureOpenAI}]. 
+
[NOTE]
====
Many self-hosted or self-managed model servers claim API compatibility with {OpenAI}. It is possible to configure the {AAPchatbot} {OpenAI} provider to point to an API-compatible model server. If the model server is truly API-compatible, especially with respect to authentication, then it might work. These configurations have not been tested by Red Hat, and issues related to their use are outside the scope of Technology Preview support.
