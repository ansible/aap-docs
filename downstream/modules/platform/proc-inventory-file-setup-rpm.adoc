= Setting up the inventory file

====
Provide a reachable IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for all hosts to ensure that users can synchronize and install content from {HubNameMain} from a different node. Do not use localhost. If localhost is used, the upgrade will be stopped as part of preflight checks.
