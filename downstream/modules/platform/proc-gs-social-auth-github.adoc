= Configuring GitHub authentication

[role="_abstract"]
You can connect GitHub identities to {PlatformNameShort} using OAuth. To set up GitHub authentication, you need to obtain an OAuth2 key and secret by registering your organization-owned application from GitHub using the link:https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/installing-your-own-github-app[registering the new application with GitHub].

The OAuth2 key (Client ID) and secret (Client Secret) are used to supply the required fields in the UI. To register the application, you must supply it with your webpage URL, which is the Callback URL shown in the Authenticator details for your authenticator configuration. 
//See xref:gw-display-auth-details[Displaying authenticator details] for instructions on accessing this information.
