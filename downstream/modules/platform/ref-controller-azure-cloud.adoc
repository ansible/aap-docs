[id="controller-azure-cloud"]

= Azure

[role="_abstract"]
{ControllerNameStart} includes built-in support for managing {Azure} cloud resources.

Azure cloud credentials exist as the following environment variables during playbook execution (in the job template, select the cloud credential needed for your setup):

* `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
* `AZURE_CERT_PATH`

Each Azure module uses these credentials when run using {ControllerName} without having to set the `subscription_id` or `management_cert_path` module options.
