= Creating a new application

[role="_abstract"]

When integrating an external web application with {PlatformNameShort}, the web application might need to create OAuth2 tokens on behalf of users of the web application.

Creating an application with the Authorization Code grant type is the preferred way to do this for the following reasons:

* External applications can obtain a token for users, using their credentials.
* Compartmentalized tokens issued for a particular application, enables those tokens to be easily managed.
For example, revoking all tokens associated with that application.

.Procedure
. From the navigation panel, select {MenuAMAdminOauthApps}.
. Click btn:[Create OAuth application].
The *Create Application* page opens.
