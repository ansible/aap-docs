= Defining a parameter on a nested component

[role="_abstract"]

To define a parameter, such as the `resource_requirements` for {ControllerName}, you add the configuration to the parent {PlatformNameShort} CR YAML. 
This ensures that the {PlatformNameShort} CR is the single source of truth for your deployment.

[NOTE]
====
The `image` and `image_version`, as well as the `{component}_image` and `{component}_image_version` parameters are intended for development or hotfix purposes only.

*Do not use these in production environments.* These settings bypass standard version management and can lead to configuration drift, inconsistent deployments, and difficulty troubleshooting issues.

.Procedure

. Log in to {OCPShort}.
. Navigate to menu:Operators[Installed Operators].
. Select your {OperatorPlatformNameShort} deployment.
. Go to the {PlatformNameShort} tab and click the name of your CR.
. In the *YAML view* tab, locate the *spec* section.
. Add the `automationcontroller` parameter with the nested `resource_requirements` parameter and its value:
+
----
spec:
  database:
    resource_requirements:
      requests:
        cpu: 200m
        memory: 512Mi
    storage_requirements:
      requests:
        storage: 100Gi
----
+
. Click btn:[Save] to apply the changes. The operator automatically applies this configuration to the {ControllerName} component.
