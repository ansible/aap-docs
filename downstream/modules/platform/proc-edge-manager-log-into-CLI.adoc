= Logging into the {RedHatEdge} through the CLI

[role="_abstract"]

How you log in the Red Hat Edge Manager depends on whether you choose the link:{URLEdgeManager}/assembly-edge-manager-install#edge-manager-oauth-auto[automatic] or link:{URLEdgeManager}/assembly-edge-manager-install#edge-manager-oauth-manually[manual] method when you initially set up the application.

.Procedure

* If you use the automatic setup you can create a personal access token, even only with Read scope (under the profile icon in the top right corner of your {PlatformNameShort} UI > *User details* > *Tokens* tab) and then use this token to log in directly through the CLI, with the following example syntax:
+
[source,bash]
----
flightctl login https://<your-edge-manager-ip-or-domain>:3443 --token=<your-aap-oauth-token> --insecure-skip-tls-verify
----

* If you use the manual setup, use the *Client ID* to log in through a web-based process, with the following example syntax:
+
[source,bash]
----
flightctl login https://<your-edge-manager-ip-or-domain>:3443 --web --client-id=<your-aap-client-id> --insecure-skip-tls-verify
----
+
** This opens in a web browser and asks you to approve.
+
The `--insecure-skip-tls-verify` parameter is used only if you have not generated your own valid certificates.

.Next steps

Use the following commands to help you with the CLI:

* To output a list of available commands, use:
+
[source,bash]
----
flightctl
----
* To output both the flightctl CLI version and the back-end {RedHatEdge} version, use:
+
[source,bash]
----
flightctl version
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
To ensure supportability and proper functionality, the version of the flightctl CLI must match the version of the {RedHatEdge} in use. 
Mismatched versions are not supported.
