= Scale down your {OperatorPlatformNameShort} deployment

[role="_abstract"]

You can scale down all {PlatformNameShort} deployments and StatefulSets by using the `idle_aap` variable. 
This is useful for scenarios such as upgrades, migrations, or disaster recovery.


.Procedure

. Log in to {OCP}.
. Go to menu:Operators[Installed Operators].
. Select your {OperatorPlatformNameShort} deployment.
. Select *All Instances* and go to your *AnsibleAutomationPlatform* instance.
. Click the *{MoreActionsIcon}* icon and then select btn:[Edit AnsibleAutomationPlatform].
. In the *YAML view* paste the following YAML code under the `spec:` section:
+
----
idle_aap: true
----
+
. Click btn:[Save]. 

.Next steps 

Setting the `idle_aap` value to `true` scales down all active deployments. Setting the value to `false` scales the deployments back up.
