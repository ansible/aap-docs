. Click the checkbox beside the team to assign that team to your chosen type of resource and click btn:[Next].
. Select the roles you want applied to the team for the chosen resource and click btn:[Next].
. Review the settings and click btn:[Save]. A progress bar displays indicating whether the role assignments were successfully applied.
. You can remove resource access for a team by selecting the - icon next to the team. This launches a confirmation dialog, asking you to confirm the removal.
