= Automation controller and automation hub 2.4 and EDA 2.5 with unified UI upgrades

{PlatformNameShort} 2.5 supports upgrades from legacy 2.4 environments as well as the current version of {EDAName} to {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 with a unified UI using the RPM install method only. Combining install methods (OCP, RPM, Containerized) within such a topology is not supported by {PlatformNameShort}.

Supported topologies described in this document assume that:

* 2.4 services will only include {ControllerName} and {HubName}.
* 2.5 parts will always include {EDAName} and the unified UI ({Gateway}).
* Combining install methods for these topologies is not supported.

== Upgrade considerations

* You must maintain two separate inventory files: one for the 2.4 services and one for the 2.5 services.
* You must maintain two separate "installations" wihtin this scenario: one for the 2.4 services and one for the 2.5 services. 
* You must "upgrade" the two separate "installations" separately.
* To upgrade to a consistent component version topology, consider the following: 
** You must manually combine the inventory file configuration from the 2.4 inventory into the 2.5 inventory and run upgrade on ONLY the 2.5 inventory file. 
** You must be using an external database for both the 2.4 inventory as well as the 2.5 inventory. 
** Customers using "managed database" instances for either 2.4 or 2.5 inventory must migrate to an external database first, before upgrading.


.Prerequisites

* An inventory from 2.4 for {ControllerName} and {HubName} and a 2.5 inventory for unified UI ({Gateway}) and {EDAName}. You must run upgrades on 2.4 services (using the inventory file to specify only {ControllerName} and {HubName} VMs) to get them to the invitial version of {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 first. When all the services are at the same version, run an upgrade (using a complete inventory file) on all the services to go to the latest version of {PlatformNameShort} 2.5.

[IMPORTANT]
====
DO NOT upgrade {EDAName} and the unified UI ({Gateway}) to the latest version of {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 without first upgrading the individual services ({ControllerName} and {HubName}) to the initial version of {PlatformNameShort} 2.5.
====

.Procedure

=== Migration path for 2.4 instances with managed databases

*Standalone node managed database*

Convert the database node to an external one, removing it from the inventory. The PostgreSQL node will continue working and will not lose the {PlatformNameShort}-provided setup, but you are responsible for managing its configuration afterward.

*Collocated managed database*

. Backup
. Restore with standalone managed database node instead of collocated.
. Unmanaged standalone database

=== Migration path for 2.4 services with 2.5 services

If you installed {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 to use {EDAName} in a supported scenario, you can upgrade your {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 {ControllerName} and {HubName} to {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 by following these steps:

* Merge 2.4 inventory data into the 2.5 inventory. The example below shows the inventory file for {ControllerName} and {HubName} for 2.4 and the inventory file for {EDAName} and the unified UI ({Gateway}) for 2.5, respectively, as the starting point, and what the merged inventory looks like. 

*Inventory files from 2.4*

[source,bash]

# Here we have the admin passwd, db credentials, etc.

eda-2
 
[gateway]
gw-1
gw-2
 
[all:vars]
# Here we have admin passwd, db credentials etc from both inventories above
----

* Run `setup.sh`
The installer upgrades {ControllerName} and {HubName} from 2.4 to {PlatformNameShort} 2.5.latest, {EDAName} and the unified UI ({Gateway}) from the fresh install of 2.5 to the latest version of 2.5, and connects {ControllerName} and {HubName} properly with the unified UI ({Gateway}) node to initialize the unified experience. 

.Verification

* Verify that everything has upgraded to 2.5 and is working properly in one of two ways: 
** performing an SSH to {ControllerName} and {EDAName}.
** In the unified UI, navigate to *Help > About* to verify the RPM versions are at 2.5.
