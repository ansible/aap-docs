= Job slice considerations

When setting up job slices, consider the following:

* A sliced job creates a workflow job, which then creates jobs.
* A job slice consists of a job template, an inventory, and a slice count.
* When executed, a sliced job splits each inventory into several "slice size" chunks.
It then queues jobs of ansible-playbook runs on each chunk of the appropriate inventory.
The inventory fed into ansible-playbook is a shortened version of the original inventory that only has the hosts in that particular slice.
The completed sliced job that displays on the *Jobs* list are labeled accordingly, with the number of sliced jobs that have run:

* These sliced jobs follow normal scheduling behavior (number of forks, queuing due to capacity, assignation to instance groups based on inventory mapping).

[NOTE]
====
Job slicing is intended to scale job executions horizontally. Enabling job slicing on a job template divides an inventory to be acted upon in the number of slices configured at launch time and then starts a job for each slice.

Normally, the number of slices is equal to or less than the number of {ControllerName} nodes. 
You can set an extremely high number of job slices but it can cause performance degradation. 
The job scheduler is not designed to simultaneously schedule thousands of workflow nodes, which are what the sliced jobs become.

* Sliced job templates with prompts or extra variables behave the same as standard job templates, applying all variables and limits to the entire set of slice jobs in the resulting workflow job.
However, when passing a limit to a sliced job, if the limit causes slices to have no hosts assigned, those slices will fail, causing the overall job to fail.
* A job slice job status of a distributed job is calculated in the same manner as workflow jobs.
It fails if there are any unhandled failures in its sub-jobs.
====

* Any job that intends to orchestrate across hosts (rather than just applying changes to individual hosts) must not be configured as a slice job.
* Any job that does, can fail, and {ControllerName} does not try to discover or account for playbooks that fail when run as slice jobs.
