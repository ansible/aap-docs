= Operating system configuration for edge devices

[role="_abstract"]

You can include an operating system-level host configuration in the image to give maximum consistency and repeatability.
To update the configuration, create a new operating system image and update devices with the new image.

However, updating devices with a new image can be impractical in the following cases:

* The configuration is missing in the image.
* The configuration needs to be specific to a device.
* The configuration needs to be updateable at runtime without updating the operating system image and rebooting.

For these cases, you can declare a set of configuration files that are present on the file system of the device.
The {RedHatEdge} agent applies updates to the configuration files while ensuring that either all files are successfully updated in the file system, or rolled back to their pre-update state.
If the user updates both an operating system and configuration set of a device at the same time, the {RedHatEdge} agent updates the operating system first. 
It then applies the specified set of configuration files.

You can also specify a list of configuration sets that the {RedHatEdge} agent applies in sequence.
In case of a conflict, the last applied configuration set is valid.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After the {RedHatEdge} agent updates the configuration on the disk, the running applications need to reload the new configuration into memory for the configuration to become effective.
If the update involves a reboot, `systemd` automatically restarts the applications with the new configuration and in the correct order.
If the update does not involve a reboot, many applications can detect changes to their configuration files and automatically reload the files.
When an application does not support change detection, you can use device lifecycle hooks to run scripts or commands if certain conditions are met.
