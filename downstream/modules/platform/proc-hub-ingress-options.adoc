.Verification

After you have configured your {HubName} operator, click btn:[Create] at the bottom of the form view. {OCP} creates the pods. This may take a few minutes.

You can view the progress by navigating to menu:Workloads[Pods] and locating the newly created instance.

Verify that the following operator pods provided by the {PlatformNameShort} Operator installation from {HubName} are running:
[cols="a,a,a", options="header", subs=+attributes]
|===
| Operator manager controllers | {ControllerNameStart} |{HubNameStart}

| The operator manager controllers for each of the 3 operators, include the following:

* automation-controller-operator-controller-manager
* automation-hub-operator-controller-manager
* resource-operator-controller-manager
| After deploying {ControllerName}, you will see the addition of these pods:

* controller
* controller-postgres
| After deploying {HubName}, you will see the addition of these pods:

* hub-api
* hub-content
* hub-postgres
* hub-redis
* hub-worker

|===

[NOTE]
====
A missing pod can indicate the need for a pull secret. Pull secrets are required for protected or private image registries. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/openshift_images/managing_images/using-image-pull-secrets.html[Using image pull secrets] for more information. You can diagnose this issue further by running `oc describe pod <pod-name>` to see if there is an ImagePullBackOff error on that pod.
