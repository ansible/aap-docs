[IMPORTANT]
====
Select the Network credential type if you are using a _local_ connection with _provider_ to use Ansible networking modules to connect to and manage networking devices.

When connecting to network devices, the credential type must match the connection type:
====

* For `local` connections using `provider`, credential type should be *Network*.
* For all other network connections (`httpapi`, `netconf`, and `network_cli`), the credential type should be *Machine*.

For more information on connection types available for network devices, see link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/network/getting_started/network_differences.html#multiple-communication-protocols[Multiple Communication Protocols].
