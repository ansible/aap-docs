= Correcting multiple signed certificates

[role="_abstract"]
If `/etc/receptor/tls/ca/mesh-CA.crt` (for RPM-based installs) or `$HOME/aap/receptor/etc/mesh-CA.crt` (for containerized installs) contains more than 10 certificates, an error occurs.

Take the following steps on all {ControllerName} and execution nodes within the {PlatformNameShort} environment.

*For an RPM-based install*

.Procedure
. Make a backup of the `mesh-CA.crt` file
+
`cp -p /etc/receptor/tls/ca/mesh-CA.crt /etc/receptor/tls/ca/mesh-CA.crt-$(date +%F)`
. Delete everything past the first certificate within the `mesh-CA.crt` file, that is, keep only the first certificate that is present at the top of the file.

. Restart receptor
+
`systemctl restart receptor`

*For a Containerized install*

. Make a backup of the `mesh-CA.crt` file
+
`cp -p $HOME/aap/receptor/etc/mesh-CA.crt $HOME/aap/receptor/etc/mesh-CA.crt-$(date +%F)`
. Delete everything past the first certificate within the `mesh-CA.crt` file, that is, keep only the first certificate that is present at the top of the file.

. Restart receptor
+
`systemctl --user restart receptor`
