= Independence of resource roles and organization membership roles

Resource-specific organization roles are independent of the organization roles of administrator and member. 
Having the "workflow administrator role" for the "Default" organization does not enable a user to view all users in the organization, but having a "member" role in the "Default" organization does. 
The two types of roles are delegated independently of each other.
