= {ControllerNameStart} logs

[role="_abstract"]
{ControllerNameStart} uses the standard Python logging module to log messages from various parts of the system. 

By default, log messages are written to log files located in `/var/log/{ControllerServiceDir}/
This logger also includes the common fields in link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/configuring_automation_execution/assembly-controller-logging-aggregation#ref-controller-log-message-schema[Log message schema].

In addition, this contains a `msg` field with the log message.
Errors contain a separate `traceback` field.
From the navigation panel, select {MenuSetLogging}. 
On the *Logging Settings* page click btn:[Edit] and use the *ENABLE EXTERNAL LOGGING* option to enable or disable the logging components.
