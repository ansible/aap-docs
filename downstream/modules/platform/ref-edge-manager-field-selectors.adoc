= Field selectors

Field selectors filter a list of {RedHatEdge} resources based on specific resource field values. 
They follow the same syntax, principles, and operators as Kubernetes Field and Label selectors, with additional operators available for more advanced search use cases.

== Supported fields

{RedHatEdge} resources give a set of metadata fields that you can select.

Each resource supports the following metadata fields:

* `metadata.name`
* `metadata.owner`
* `metadata.creationTimestamp`

[NOTE]

====
To query labels, use Label Selectors for advanced and flexible label filtering.
