= Upgrading an external database for {Gateway} on {OperatorPlatformName}

[role="_abstract"]

To upgrade from {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 to 2.5 with an external database, you must scale down your Operator deployment, upgrade your PostgreSQL, then scale your deployment back up. 

.Prerequisites

* A 2.4 {ControllerName} and {HubName} deployment with an external PostgreSQL 13 database

.Procedure

. Scale down your deployments in their respective namespaces using:
+
`oc scale deployment --replicas=0 -n <component-namespace> <component-deployment>`
+
.. {ControllerNameStart}:
... `automation-controller-operator-controller-manager`
... `<controller-name>-controller-task`
... `<controller-name>-controller-web`
.. {HubNameStart}:
... `automation-hub-operator-controller-manager`
... `<hub-name>-hub-api`
... `<hub-name>-hub-content`
... `<hub-name>-hub-redis`
... `<hub-name>-hub-worker`
.. The remaining operators:
... `ansible-lightspeed-operator-controller-manager`
... `eda-server-operator-controller-manager`
... `resource-operator-controller-manager`
. Upgrade your PostgreSQL 13 to {PostgresVers}.
. Scale your deployments back up using:
+
`oc scale deployment --replicas=1 -n <component-namespace> <component-deployment>`
+
. Log in to {OCP}.
. Navigate to menu:Operators[Installed Operators].
. Click the {MoreActionsIcon} icon next to your deployment and then click btn:[Edit Subscription].
. From the *Details* tab, select btn:[Update Channel].
. Select *stable-2.5* as the channel and click btn:[Save].
. Deploy {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers} using the following custom resource (CR):
