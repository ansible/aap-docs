= Types of nodes in {ControllerName}

You can configure four types of nodes in an {ControllerName} deployment: 

* Control nodes
* Hybrid nodes
* Execution nodes
* Hop nodes

However, in an operator-based installation, there are no hybrid or control nodes. 
There are container groups, which make up containers running on the Kubernetes cluster. 
That comprises the control plane. 
That control plane is local to the kubernetes cluster in which {PlatformName} is deployed.
