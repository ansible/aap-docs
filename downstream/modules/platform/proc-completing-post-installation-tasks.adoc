= Completing post installation tasks

[role="_abstract"]
After you have completed the installation of {PlatformNameShort}, ensure that {HubName} and {ControllerName} deploy properly.


== Adding a controller subscription



.Procedure

. Navigate to the FQDN of the {ControllerNameStart}. Log in with the username admin and the password you specified as `admin_password` in your inventory file.

. Click btn:[Browse] and select the __manifest.zip__ you created earlier.

. Click btn:[Next].

. Uncheck btn:[User analytics] and btn:[Automation analytics]. These rely on an internet connection and must be turned off.

. Click btn:[Next].

. Read the End User License Agreement and click btn:[Submit] if you agree.

== Updating the CA trust store

As part of your post-installation tasks, you must update the software's certificates.
By default, {PlatformNameShort} {HubName} and {ControllerName} are installed using self-signed certificates. Because of this, the controller does not trust the hub’s certificate and will not download the {ExecEnvShort} from the hub. 

To ensure that automation controller downloads the execution environment from automation hub, you must import the hub’s Certificate Authority (CA) certificate as a trusted certificate on the controller. You can do this in one of two ways, depending on whether SSH is available as root user between {ControllerName} and {PrivateHubName}. 

=== Using secure copy (SCP) as a root user

If SSH is available as the root user between the controller and {PrivateHubName}, use SCP to copy the root certificate on the {PrivateHubName} to the controller.


.Procedure

 . Run `update-ca-trust` on the controller to update the CA trust store:

----
$ sudo -i
# scp <hub_fqdn>:/etc/pulp/certs/root.crt
/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/automationhub-root.crt
# update-ca-trust
----

=== Copying and pasting as a non root user

If SSH is unavailable as root between the {PrivateHubName} and the controller, copy the contents of the file __/etc/pulp/certs/root.crt__ on the {PrivateHubName} and paste it into a new file on the controller called __/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/automationhub-root.crt__. 

.Procedure

. Run `update-ca-trust` to update the CA trust store with the new certificate. On the {PrivateHubName}, run:

----
$ sudo -i
# cat /etc/pulp/certs/root.crt
(copy the contents of the file, including the lines with 'BEGIN CERTIFICATE' and
'END CERTIFICATE')
----

. On the {ControllerName}:

----
$ sudo -i
# vi /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/automationhub-root.crt
(paste the contents of the root.crt file from the private automation hub into the new file and write to disk)
# update-ca-trust
----
