= Node counting in licenses

The {ControllerName} license defines the number of Managed Nodes that can be managed as part of a {PlatformName} subscription.

A typical license says 'License Count: 500', which sets the maximum number of Managed Nodes at 500.

For more information on managed node requirements for licensing, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/3331481

Ansible does not recycle node counts or reset automated hosts.
