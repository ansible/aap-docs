The {PlatformNameShort} subscription defines the number of Managed Nodes that can be managed as part of your subscription. 

For more information about managed node requirements for subscriptions, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/3331481[How are "managed nodes" defined as part of the {PlatformName} offering].

Ansible does not recycle node counts or reset automated hosts.
