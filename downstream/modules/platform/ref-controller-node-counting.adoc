= Node counting in licenses

The {PlatformNameShort} license defines the number of Managed Nodes that can be managed as part of your subscription.

A typical license says "License Count: 500", which sets the maximum number of Managed Nodes at 500.

For more information about managed node requirements for licensing, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/3331481[How are "managed nodes" defined as part of the {PlatformName} offering].

Ansible does not recycle node counts or reset automated hosts.
