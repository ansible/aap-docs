= Upgrade considerations

If you are upgrading from version 2.4, continue to the xref:upgrading-operator_{context}[Upgrading the {OperatorPlatformNameShort}].

If your {OCPShort} version is not supported by the {PlatformName} version you are upgrading to, you must upgrade your {OCPShort} cluster to a supported version first.

Refer to the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/ansible-automation-platform[Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Life Cycle] to determine the {OCPShort} version needed.

For information about upgrading your cluster, refer to link:{BaseURL}/openshift_container_platform/4.7/html-single/updating_clusters/index[Updating clusters].
