= 2.4 multi node {ControllerName} and {HubName} deployment to a {PlatformVers} {EnterpriseTopology}

[role="_abstract"]
You can upgrade your 2.4 multi node {ControllerName} and {HubName} deployment to a {PlatformVers} {EnterpriseTopology}. This section outlines the infrastructure changes, requirements, and an example inventory for upgrading.

== 2.4 infrastructure topology diagram

This diagram outlines the 2.4 infrastructure topology that Red Hat has tested with this deployment model.

== Requirements for upgrading a multi {ControllerName} node and {HubName} deployment

The following table highlights the requirements for upgrading from {PlatformNameShort} version 2.4 to {PlatformVers}.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|====
|Existing 2.4 topology |Tested {PlatformVers} topology |Requirements for each VM

a| Redundant deployment with {ControllerName} and {HubName}:

* Two {ControllerName} VMs
* Two {HubName} VMs
* One {AutomationMesh} hop node VM
* Two {AutomationMesh} execution node VMs
* One customer-provided (external) {PostgresVers} database
* One HA proxy load balancer in front of {ControllerName} and {HubName}

a| Enterprise topology:

* Two {Gateway} with colocated Redis VMs
* Two {ControllerName} VMs
* Two {PrivateHubName} with colocated Redis VMs
* Two {EDAcontroller} with colocated Redis VMs
* One {AutomationMesh} hop node VM
* Two {AutomationMesh} execution node VMs
* One customer-provided (external) {PostgresVers} database
* One HA proxy load balancer in front of {Gateway}

*Note*: Redis high availability requires 6 VMs. Redis can be colocated with {HubName}, {Gateway}, or {EDAName} components, but it cannot be colocated with {ControllerName}, execution nodes, or the PostgreSQL database.

== Example inventory file

The following inventory file has been updated with the necessary changes to upgrade to the {PlatformVers} {EnterpriseTopology}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If your 2.4 inventory file uses `automationhub_main_url` for a load balancer, you must remove this variable from your {PlatformVers} inventory file. The load balancer is now expected to be configured in front of {Gateway} (`automationgateway_main_url`).
