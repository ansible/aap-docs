= Creating the `cloud-init` configuration

[role="_abstract"]

The `cloud-init` configuration customizes a virtual machine instance on its first boot, allowing you to automatically enroll it as a new agent in your {RedHatEdge} service.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the `flightctl` CLI and logged in to your {RedHatEdge} service instance.
* You installed the `oc` CLI, used it to log in to your OpenShift cluster instance, and changed to the project in which you want to create your virtual machine.

.Procedure 

. Request a new {RedHatEdge} agent enrollment configuration and store it in a file called `config.yaml` by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
flightctl certificate request --signer=enrollment --expiration=365d --output=embedded > config.yaml
----

. Create a cloud configuration user data file called `cloud-config.yaml` that places the agent configuration in the correct location on the first boot by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
cat <<EOF > cloud-config.yaml
#cloud-config
write_files:
- path: /etc/flightctl/config.yaml
  content: $(cat config.yaml | base64 -w0)
  encoding: b64
EOF
----

. Create a Kubernetes `Secret` that contains the cloud configuration user data file:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc create secret generic enrollment-secret --from-file=userdata=cloud-config.yaml
----
