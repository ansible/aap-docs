= Configure GitHub enterprise authentication

[role="_abstract"]
To set up social authentication for a GitHub enterprise, you must obtain a GitHub Enterprise URL, an API URL, OAuth2 key and secret for a web application.

To obtain the URLs, see the link:https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.1/rest/reference/enterprise-admin[GitHub Enterprise administration documentation].

The OAuth2 key (Client ID) and secret (Client Secret) are used to supply the required fields in the UI. To register the application, you must supply it with your webpage URL, which is the *Callback URL* shown in the Authenticator details for your authenticator configuration. See xref:gw-display-auth-details[Displaying authenticator details] for instructions on accessing this information.

Each key and secret must belong to a unique application and cannot be shared or reused between different authentication backends. The OAuth2 key (Client ID) and secret (Client Secret) are used to supply the required fields in the UI.
