= Supported installation scenarios for {OCP}


You can use the OperatorHub on the {OCP} web console to install {OperatorPlatform}.

Alternatively, you can install {OperatorPlatform} from the {OCPShort} command-line interface (CLI), `oc`.

After you have installed {OperatorPlatform} you must create an *AnsibleAutomationPlatform* custom resource (CR). This allows you to manage {PlatformNameShort} components from a single unified interface known as the platform gateway. As of version 2.5, you must create an {PlatformNameShort} CR, even if you have an existing {ControllerName},  {HubName}, or {EDAName}, components.

If existing components have already been deployed, you must specify these components on the {PlatformNameShort} CR. You must create the custom resource in the same namespace as the existing components.
