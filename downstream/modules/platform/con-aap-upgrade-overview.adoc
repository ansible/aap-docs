|Scenario |Changes |Additional information

|Upgrading from 2.5 to 2.6
|Upgrading from 2.5 to 2.6 does not involve changes to the platform infrastructure requirements, architecture, or services. The improvements described in the 2.4 to 2.6 upgrade path are also present in the 2.5 to 2.6 upgrade path; however, the {Gateway} service is already in place in 2.5.

If you upgraded from 2.4 to 2.5, you must migrate your authentication methods and users before upgrading to 2.6 as that legacy authenticator functionality was removed.

Any users that were created during the 2.4 to 2.5 upgrade that were not fully migrated will be removed from the system when upgrading to 2.6. The users that have previously merged their user records while on 2.5 will continue to function as is for 2.6.

Any 2.4 {ControllerName} users that have not successfully logged into 2.5 since upgrading from 2.4, will be unable to log into {PlatformNameShort} UI after upgrading to 2.6. The user will be backwards compatible for direct automation execution access but unable to access the full platform. Please ensure all users planning to leverage 2.6 have successfully logged into 2.5 prior to upgrading. 

*Note:* Upgrades from the latest 2.5 version to 2.6 are supported with all deployment types: RPM, containerized, and {OCPShort} deployments.

.5|Upgrading from 2.4 to 2.6
|{PlatformNameShort} supports upgrading directly from the latest 2.4 version to 2.6. Directly upgrading to 2.6 is the recommended upgrade path from 2.4, as a number of improvements in 2.6 simplify and improve the upgrade experience.

*Note:* You can upgrade directly from the latest 2.4 version to 2.6 with RPM and {OCPShort} deployments. However, upgrading {EDAName} 2.4 or from the 2.4 containerized deployment is not supported, as both features were Tech Preview in 2.4.
a|See the upgrade document for your deployment type:

* link:{URLUpgrade}[RPM]
* link:{URLOperatorInstallation}/operator-upgrade_licensing-gw[{OCPShort}]

|
|{PlatformNameShort} RPM deployments require additional infrastructure compared with 2.4, due to the addition of the {Gateway} service. Infrastructure needs vary depending on factors such as whether you implement a growth or an enterprise deployment.

*Note:* Additional infrastructure requirements apply only when upgrading RPM deployments.
|See link:{URLPlanningUpgrade}/upgrade-infrastructure-changes[Infrastructure changes] for details about infrastructure and inventory file changes in various upgrade scenarios.

|
|Enterprise authentication configuration and mappings (for example, SAML, LDAP, OIDC) move from {ControllerName} 2.4 to {Gateway} 2.6 as part of the upgrade process. You do not need to manually reconfigure these authentication methods after you upgrade.

*Note:* Authentication upgrade improvements apply to RPM and {OCPShort} deployments. Upgrades from the 2.4 containerized deployment Tech Preview release are not supported. Additionally, upgrading {EDAName} 2.4 is not supported.
|See link:{URLCentralAuth}[{TitleCentralAuth}] for information about authentication options in general.

|
a|All {ControllerName} Identity Access Management (IAM) data moves from {ControllerName} 2.4 to the {Gateway} in 2.6 as part of the upgrade process. With {ControllerName} 2.4 as the default source of IAM data for the {Gateway} in 2.6, users retain their memberships and are assigned appropriate platform-level roles in 2.6. 

As part of the upgrade process:

* Users, teams, organizations, their memberships, and common roles in 2.4 move from {ControllerName} 2.4 to the {Gateway} in 2.6.
* Administrators in {ControllerName} 2.4 become {Gateway} administrators in 2.6.
* Controller admins in 2.4 become {Gateway} admins in 2.6.

The more organizations, teams, and users being migrated during an upgrade, the longer the upgrade takes. As an example, upgrading and migrating 4,000 users, 400 teams, and 40 organizations may take close to two hours.

*Note:* Identity access management changes apply to RPM and {OCPShort} deployments. Upgrades from the 2.4 containerized deployment Tech Preview release are not supported.
|See link:{URLPlanningUpgrade}/upgrade-data-movement[Data movement during upgrade] for more information.

|Some APIs are being deprecated in 2.6.
|See link:{URLPlanningUpgrade}/upgrade-api-changes[API changes] for more information.

|Upgrading from 2.5 to 2.6 and upgrading from 2.4 to 2.6
|All {PlatformNameShort} collections, which support the Configuration-as-Code (CaC) approach, now use a standard global environment variable name and module variable name across {PlatformNameShort} components. For more details, see link:{URLReleaseNotes}[What’s new around RBAC in 2.6] and link:{URLReleaseNotes}[What’s changed around RBAC for users moving from 2.5 to 2.6]
