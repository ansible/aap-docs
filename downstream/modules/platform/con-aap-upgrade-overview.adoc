|Upgrading from 2.5 to 2.6
|Upgrading from 2.5 to 2.6 does not involve changes to the platform infrastructure requirements, architecture, or services. The improvements described in the 2.4 to 2.6 upgrade path are also present in the 2.5 to 2.6 upgrade path; however, the {Gateway} service is already in place in 2.5.

*Note:* Upgrades from the latest 2.5 version to 2.6 are supported with all deployment types: RPM, containerized, and {OCPShort} deployments.

.6|Upgrading from 2.4 to 2.6
|{PlatformNameShort} supports upgrading directly from the latest 2.4 version to 2.6. Directly upgrading to 2.6 is the recommended upgrade path from 2.4, as a number of improvements in 2.6 simplify and improve the upgrade experience.

*Note:* You can upgrade directly from the latest 2.4 version to 2.6 with RPM and {OCPShort} deployments. However, upgrading {EDAName} 2.4 or from the 2.4 containerized deployment is not supported, as both features were Tech Preview in 2.4.
a|See the upgrade document for your deployment type:

* link:{URLUpgrade}[RPM]
* link:{URLOperatorInstallation}/operator-upgrade_licensing-gw[{OCPShort}]

|
|{PlatformNameShort} RPM deployments require additional infrastructure compared with 2.4, due to the addition of the {Gateway} service. Infrastructure needs vary depending on factors such as whether you implement a growth or an enterprise deployment.

*Note:* Additional infrastructure requirements apply only when upgrading RPM deployments.
|See link:{URLPlanningUpgrade}/upgrade-infrastructure-changes[Infrastructure changes] for details about infrastructure and inventory file changes in various upgrade scenarios.

|
|Enterprise authentication configuration and mappings (for example, SAML, LDAP, OIDC) move from {ControllerName} 2.4 to {Gateway} 2.6 as part of the upgrade process. You do not need to manually reconfigure these authentication methods after you upgrade.

*Note:* Authentication upgrade improvements apply to RPM and {OCPShort} deployments. Upgrades from the 2.4 containerized deployment Tech Preview release are not supported. Additionally, upgrading {EDAName} 2.4 is not supported.
|See link:{URLCentralAuth}[{TitleCentralAuth}] for information about authentication options in general.

|
a|All {ControllerName} Identity Access Management (IAM) data moves from {ControllerName} 2.4 to the {Gateway} in 2.6 as part of the upgrade process. With {ControllerName} 2.4 as the default source of IAM data for the {Gateway} in 2.6, users retain their memberships and are assigned appropriate platform-level roles in 2.6. 

As part of the upgrade process:

* Users, teams, organizations, their memberships, and common roles in 2.4 move from {ControllerName} 2.4 to the {Gateway} in 2.6.
* Administrators in {ControllerName} 2.4 become {Gateway} administrators in 2.6.
* Controller admins in 2.4 become {Gateway} admins in 2.6.

*Note:* Identity access management changes apply to RPM and {OCPShort} deployments. Upgrades from the 2.4 containerized deployment Tech Preview release are not supported.
