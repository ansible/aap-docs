You can use the Ansible Vault credential type to store sensitive data, such as passwords or keys, in encrypted files.

Select this credential type to enable synchronization of inventory with Ansible Vault.

Vault credentials require the *Vault Password* and an optional *Vault Identifier* if applying multi-Vault credentialing. 

// For more information about the Multi-Vault support, see the link:https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/administration/multi-creds-assignment.html#multi-vault-credentials[Multi-Vault Credentials] section of _{ControllerAG}_.

You can configure {ControllerName} to ask the user for the password at launch time by selecting *Prompt on launch*. 

When you select *Prompt on launch*, a dialog opens when the job is launched, prompting the user to enter the password.

[WARNING]
====
Credentials that are used in scheduled jobs must not be configured as *Prompt on launch*.
