= Role-based access controls

//Not sure whether this is still true.
To edit and delete a workflow job template, you must have the administrator role. 
To create a workflow job template, you must be an organization administrator or a system administrator. 
However, you can run a workflow job template that contains job templates that you do not have permissions for. 
System administrators can create a blank workflow and then grant an `admin_role` to a low-level user, after which they can delegate more access and build the graph. 
You must have `execute` access to a job template to add it to a workflow job template.

You can also perform other tasks, such as making a duplicate copy or re-launching a workflow, depending on which permissions are granted to a user. 
You must have permissions to all the resources used in a workflow, such as job templates, before relaunching or making a copy.
