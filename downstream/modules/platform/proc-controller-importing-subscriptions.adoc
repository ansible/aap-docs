= Importing a subscription

After you have obtained an authorized {PlatformNameShort} subscription, you must import it into the {ControllerName} system before you can use {ControllerName}.
.Prerequisites

* You have obtained a subscriptions manifest. 
For more information, see link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html-single/automation_controller_user_guide/index#proc-controller-obtaining-subscriptions-manifest[Obtaining a subscriptions manifest].

.Procedure

. Launch {ControllerName} for the first time. 
The *Subscription Management* screen displays.

+
. Retrieve and import your subscription by completing either of the following steps:
.. If you have obtained a subscription manifest, upload it by navigating to the location where the file is saved.
The subscription manifest is the complete `.zip` file, and not only its component parts.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the *Browse* option in the *Subscription manifest* option is disabled, clear the *username* and *password* fields to enable it.
====
+
The subscription metadata is then retrieved from the RHSM/Satellite API, or from the manifest provided. 
If many subscription counts were applied in a single installation, {ControllerName} combines the counts but uses the earliest expiration date as the expiry (at which point you must refresh your subscription).
.. If you are using your Red Hat customer credentials, enter your username and password on the license page. 
Use your Satellite username or password if your {ControllerName} cluster nodes are registered to Satellite with Subscription Manager. 
After you enter your credentials, click btn:[Get Subscriptions].
+
{ControllerNameStart} retrieves your configured subscription service. 
Then, it prompts you to select the subscription that you want to run and applies that metadata to {ControllerName}. 
You can log in over time and retrieve new subscriptions if you have renewed.
+
. Click btn:[Next] to proceed to the *Tracking and Insights* page. 
+
Tracking and insights collect data to help Red Hat improve the product and deliver a better user experience. 
For more information about data collection, see link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html-single/automation_controller_administration_guide/index#controller-usability-analytics-data-collection[Usability Analytics and Data Collection] of the _{ControllerAG}_.
+ 
This option is checked by default, but you can opt out of any of the following:

* *User analytics*. Collects data from the controller UI.
* *Insights Analytics*. Provides a high level analysis of your automation with {ControllerName}. 
It helps you to identify trends and anomalous use of the controller. 
For opt-in of {Analytics} to be effective, your instance of {ControllerName} must be running on {RHEL}. 
For more information, see the link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html-single/automation_controller_administration_guide/index#ref-controller-automation-analytics[{Analytics}] section.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can change your analytics data collection preferences at any time.
====
+
. After you have specified your tracking and Insights preferences, click btn:[Next] to proceed to the End User Agreement.
. Review and check the *I agree to the End User License Agreement* checkbox and click btn:[Submit].
+
After your subscription is accepted, {ControllerName} displays the subscription details and opens the Dashboard. 
To return to the Subscription settings screen from the Dashboard, select menu:Settings[Subscription settings] from the btn:[Subscription] option in the navigation panel.

. Optional: To return to the Subscription settings screen from the Dashboard, select menu:Settings[Subscription settings] option in the navigation panel.

.Troubleshooting your subscription

When your subscription expires (you can check this in the Subscription details of the Subscription settings window), you must renew it in {ControllerName}. 
You can do this by either importing a new subscription, or setting up a new subscription.

If you meet the "Error fetching licenses" message, check that you have the proper permissions required for the Satellite user. 
The {ControllerName} administrator requires this to apply a subscription.

The Satellite username and password is used to query the Satellite API for existing subscriptions. 
From the Satellite API, the {ControllerName} receives metadata about those subscriptions, then filters through to find valid subscriptions that you can apply. 
These are then displayed as valid subscription options in the UI.

The following Satellite roles grant proper access:

* Custom with `view_subscriptions` and `view_organizations` filter
* Viewer
* Administrator
* Organization Administrator
* Manager

Use the *Custom* role for your {ControllerName} integration, as it is the most restrictive. 
For more information, see the link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_satellite/{SatelliteVers}/html/administering_red_hat_satellite/managing_users_and_roles_admin#Creating_and_Managing_Roles_admin[Satellite documentation] on managing users and roles.

[NOTE]
====
The *System Administrator* role is not equal to the *Administrator* user checkbox, and does not offer enough permissions to access the subscriptions API page.
