= Platform gateway

//To be added to Donna's AAP/UI document for 2.5 

The Platform gateway is the service that handles authentication and authorization for {PlatformNameShort}. 
It provides a single ingress into the Platform and serves the Platform's user interface.

Use the following procedure to configure the options.

.Procedure
. From the navigation panel, select {MenuSetGateway}.
. The Platform gateway settings page is displayed.

+
. You can configure the following platform gateway options:

* *Platform gateway proxy url*: URL to the platform gateway proxy layer.
* *Platform gateway proxy url ignore cert*: Ignore the certificate to the platform gateway proxy layer.
* *Allow admin to set insecure*: Whether a superuser account can save an insecure password when editing any local user account.
* *Platform gateway basic auth enabled*: Enable basic authentication to the platform gateway API.
+
Turning this off prevents all basic authentication (local users), so customers need to make sure they have their alternative authentication mechanisms correctly configured before doing so. 
+
Turning it off with only local authentication configured also prevents all access to the UI.
+
*Social auth username in full email*: Enabling this setting alerts social authentication to use the full email as username instead of the full name.
+
*Platform gateway token name*: The header name to push from the proxy to the backend service. 
+
[WARNING]
==== 
If this name is changed, backends must be updated to compensate.
====
+
* *Platform gateway access token expiration*: How long the access tokens are valid for.
* *JWT private key*: The private key used to encrypt the JWT tokens sent to back end services. 
+
This should be a private RSA key and one should be generated automatically on installation.
+
[NOTE]
==== 
Use caution when rotating the key as it will cause current sessions to fail until their JWT keys are reset.
====
+
* (Read only) *JWT public key*: The private key used to encrypt the JWT tokens sent to back end services. 
+
This should be a private RSA key and one should be generated automatically on installation. 
+
[NOTE]
==== 
See other services' documentation on how they consume this key.

You can configure the following Session options:

* *Session cookie age*: Time in seconds before a session expires.

You can configure the following Password security options:

* *Password min upper*: How many uppercase characters need to be in a local password.
* *Password min length*: The minimum length of a local password.
* *Password min digits*: How many numerical characters need to be in a local password.
* *Password min special*: How many special characters need to be in a local password.

You can configure the following Custom login options:

* *Custom login info*: Provide specific information (such as a legal notice or a disclaimer) to a text box in the login modal.
* *Custom logo* : Provide an image file for setting up a custom logo (must be a data URL with a base64-encoded GIF, PNG, or JPEG image).
For more information, see xref:proc-custom-logos-images[Setting a custom logo].

You can configure the following additional settings:

* *JWT expiration buffer in seconds*: The number of seconds before a JWT token's expiration to revoke from the cache.
+
When authentication happens a JWT token is created for the user and that token is cached. 
When subsequent calls happen to services such as automation controller or EDA, the token is taken from the cache and sent to the service. 
Both the token and the cache of the token have an expiration time. 
If the token expires while in the cache the authentication process attempts results in a 401 error (unauthorized). 
This setting gives {PlatformName} a buffer by removing the JWT token from the cache before the token expires. 
When a token is revoked from cache a new token with a new expiration is generated and cached for the user. 
As a result, expired tokens from the cache are never used. 
This setting defaults to 2 seconds. 
If you have a large latency between platform gateway and your services and observe 401 responses you m  increase this setting to lower the number of 401 responses.
* *Status endpoint backend timeout seconds*: Timeout (in seconds) for the status endpoint to wait when trying to connect to a backend.
* *Allow auth2 for external users*: For security reasons, users from external authentication providers, such as LDAP, SAML, SSO, Radius, and others, are not allowed to create OAuth2 tokens. 
To change this behavior, enable this setting. 
Existing tokens are not deleted when this setting is turned off.
