= Vertical scaling improvements

Control nodes are responsible for processing the output of jobs and writing them to the database. 
The process that does this is called the callback receiver. 

The callback receiver has a configurable number of workers, controlled by the setting `JOB_EVENT_WORKERS`. 
In the past, the default for this setting was always 4, regardless of the CPU or memory capacity of the node. 
Now, in traditional virtual machines, the `JOB_EVENT_WORKERS` is set to the number of processors if that is greater than 4. 
This means administrators who provision larger control nodes see greater ability for those nodes to keep up with the job output created by jobs without having to manually adjust `JOB_EVENT_WORKERS`.
