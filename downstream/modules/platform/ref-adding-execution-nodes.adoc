= Adding execution nodes

[role="_abstract"]

The containerized installer can deploy remote execution nodes. This is handled by the execution_nodes group in the ansible inventory file.

[execution_nodes]
fqdn_of_your_execution_host

An execution node is by default configured as an execution type running on port 27199 (TCP).
This can be changed by the following variables:

* receptor_port=27199
* receptor_protocol=tcp
* receptor_type=hop

Receptor type value can be either execution or hop, while the protocol is either TCP or UDP. By default, the nodes in the `execution_nodes` group will be added as peers for the controller node. However, you can change the peers configuration by using the `receptor_peers` variable.
