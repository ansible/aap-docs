= Adding execution nodes

[role="_abstract"]

The containerized installer can deploy remote execution nodes. The `execution_nodes` group in the inventory file handles this.

----
[execution_nodes]
<fqdn_of_your_execution_host>
----

An execution node is by default configured as an execution type running on port 27199 (TCP).
This can be changed by the following variables:

----
receptor_port=27199
receptor_protocol=tcp
receptor_type=hop
----

The `receptor_type` value can be either `execution` or `hop`, while the `receptor_protocol` is either `tcp` or `udp`. By default, the nodes in the `execution_nodes` group will be added as peers for the controller node. However, you can change the peers configuration by using the `receptor_peers` variable.
