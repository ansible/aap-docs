= Execution environment mount options

Rebuilding an {ExecEnvShort} is one way to add certificates, but inheriting certificates from the host provides a more convenient solution. 
For VM-based installations, {ControllerName} automatically mounts the system truststore in the {ExecEnvShort} when jobs run.

You can customize {ExecEnvShort} mount options and mount paths in the *Paths to expose to isolated jobs* field of the *Job Settings* page, where Podman-style volume mount syntax is supported.
