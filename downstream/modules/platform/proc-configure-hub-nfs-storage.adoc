= Configuring Network File System (NFS) storage for {HubName}

NFS is a type of shared storage that is supported in containerized installations. Shared storage is required when installing more than one instance of {HubName} with a `file` storage backend. When installing a single instance of the {HubName}, shared storage is optional.

.Procedure

. To configure shared storage for {HubName}, set the `hub_shared_data_path` variable in your inventory file:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
hub_shared_data_path=<path_to_nfs_share>
----
+
The value must match the format `host:dir`, for example `nfs-server.example.com:/exports/hub`.
. (Optional) To change the mount options for your NFS share, use the `hub_shared_data_mount_opts` variable. The default value is `rw,sync,hard`.
