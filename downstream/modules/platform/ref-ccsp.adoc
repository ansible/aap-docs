= CCSP

`CCSP` is the original report format. It does not include many of the customization of CCSPv2, and it is intended to be used only for the CCSP partner program.

== Optional collectors for `gather` command

You can use the following optional collectors for the `gather` command:

* *main_jobhostsummary`
** If present by default, this incrementally collects the `main_jobhostsummary` table from the {ControllerName} database, containing information about jobs runs and managed nodes automated.
* `main_host`
** This collects daily snapshots of the `main_host` table from the {ControllerName} database and has managed nodes/hosts present across {ControllerName} inventories,
* `main_jobevent`
** This incrementally collects the `main_jobevent` table from the {ControllerName} database and contains information about which modules, roles, and ansible collections are being used.
* main_indirectmanagednodeaudit
** This incrementally collects the `main_indirectmanagednodeaudit` table from the {ControllerName} database and contains information about indirectly managed nodes,

# Example with all optional collectors
export METRICS_UTILITY_OPTIONAL_COLLECTORS="main_host,main_jobevent,main_indirectmanagednodeaudit"

== Optional sheets for `build_report` command

You may use the following optional sheets for the `build_report` command:

* `ccsp_summary`
** This is a landing page specifically for partners under the CCSP program. It shows managed node usage by each {ControllerName} organization.
** This report takes additional parameters to customize the summary page. For more information, see the following example:

== Selecting a date range for your CCSP report

The default behavior of this report is to build a report for the previous month. The following examples describe how to override this default behavior to select a specific date range for your report: 

----
# Builds report for a previous month
metrics-utility build_report

# Build report for a specific month
metrics-utility build_report --month=2025-03 

# Build report for a specific month overriding an existing report
metrics-utility build_report --month=2025-03 --force
