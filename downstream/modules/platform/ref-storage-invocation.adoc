= Storage and invocation

The `RENEWAL_GUIDANCE` report supports the use of only local disk storage to store the report results. This report does not have a gather data step. It reads directly from the controller HostMetric table, so it does not store any raw data under the `METRICS_UTILITY_SHIP_PATH`.

# Will generate report for 12 months back with epehemeral nodes being nodes
