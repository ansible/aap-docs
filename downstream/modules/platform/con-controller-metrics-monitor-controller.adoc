= Metrics to monitor {ControllerName}

Monitor your {ControllerName} hosts at the system and application levels. 

System level monitoring includes the following information:

* Disk I/O
* RAM use
* CPU use
* Network traffic 

Application level metrics provide data that the application knows about the system. This data includes the following information: 

* How many jobs are running in a given instance
* Capacity information about instances in the cluster
* How many inventories are present 
* How many hosts are in those inventories

Using system and application metrics can help you identify what was happening in the application when a service degradation occurred. Information about {ControllerName}'s performance over time helps when diagnosing problems or doing capacity planning for future growth.
