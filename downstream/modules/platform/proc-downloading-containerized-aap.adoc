.Procedure

. Download the latest installer tarball from link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/480/ver=2.4/rhel---9/2.4/x86_64/product-software[access.redhat.com]. This can be done directly within the RHEL host, which saves time.

. If you have downloaded the tarball and optional manifest zip file onto your laptop, copy them onto your RHEL host.
+
Decide where you would like the installer to reside on the filesystem. Installation related files will be created under this location and require at least 10Gb for the initial installation.
+
. Unpack the installer tarball into your installation directory, and cd into the unpacked directory.
