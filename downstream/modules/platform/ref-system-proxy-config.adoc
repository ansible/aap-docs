= System proxy configuration

[role="_abstract"]
An outbound proxy (egress proxy) is a server that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers on the internet. 
It is used to regulate and secure client traffic, and to provide caching services to improve performance.

The outbound proxy is configured on the system level for all the nodes in the control plane. 

You must set the following environment variables:
----
http_proxy=“http://external-proxy_0:3128”
https_proxy=“http://external-proxy_0:3128”
no_proxy=“localhost,127.0.0.0/8,10.0.0.0/8”
----
You can also add those variables to the '/etc/environment' file to make them permanent. 

The installation program ensures that all external communication during the installation goes through the proxy. 
For containerized installation, those variables ensure that Podman uses the egress proxy.
