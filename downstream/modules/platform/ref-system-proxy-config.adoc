= System proxy configuration
The outbound proxy is configured on the system level for all the nodes in the control plane. 

The following environment variables must be set:
----
http_proxy=“http://external-proxy_0:3128”
https_proxy=“http://external-proxy_0:3128”
no_proxy=“localhost,127.0.0.0/8,10.0.0.0/8”
----
You can also add those variables to the '/etc/environment' file to make them permanent. 

The installation program ensures that all external communication during the installation goes through the proxy. 
For containerized installation, those variables ensure that the podman uses the egress proxy.
