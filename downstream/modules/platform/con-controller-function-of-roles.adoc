= Function of roles: editing and creating

Organization “resource roles” functionality are specific to a certain resource type - such as workflows. 
Being a member of such a role usually provides two types of permissions.
If a user is given a "workflow admin role" for the organization "Default", then they have the following permissions:

* This user can create new workflows in the organization "Default"
* This user can edit all workflows in the "Default" organization

One exception is job templates, where having the role is independent of creation permission.
For more information, see xref:controller-job-templates[Job Templates].
