= Resource determination for capacity algorithm

Capacity algorithms determine how many forks a system is capable of running simultaneously. 
These algorithms control how many systems Ansible can communicate with simultaneously. 
Increasing the number of forks an {ControllerName} system is running enables jobs to run faster by performing more work in parallel.
However, this increases the load on the system, which can cause work to slow down.

The default, `mem_capacity`, enables you to over-commit processing resources while protecting the system from running out of memory. 
If most of your work is not processor-bound, then selecting this mode maximizes the number of forks.
