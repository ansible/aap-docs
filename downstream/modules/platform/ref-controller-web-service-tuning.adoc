= Tune the web server

[role="_abstract"]
The Control and Hybrid nodes each serve the UI and API of {ControllerName}. WSGI traffic is served by the uwsgi web server on a local socket. ASGI traffic is served by Daphne. NGINX listens on port 443 and proxies traffic as needed. 

To scale {ControllerName}'s web service, follow these best practices:

* Deploy multiple control nodes and use a load balancer to spread web requests over multiple servers.
* Set max connections per {ControllerName} to 100.

To optimize {ControllerName}'s web service on the client side, follow these guidelines:

* Direct user to use dynamic inventory sources instead of individually creating inventory hosts by using the API.
* Use webhook notifications instead of polling for job status.
* Use the bulk APIs for host creation and job launching to batch requests. 
* Use token authentication. For automation clients that must make many requests very quickly, using tokens is a best practice, because depending on the type of user, there might be additional overhead when using Basic authentication.
