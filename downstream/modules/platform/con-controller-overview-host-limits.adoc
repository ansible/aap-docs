= Limit the number of hosts per organization
Many large organizations have instances shared among many organizations.
To ensure that one organization cannot use all the licensed hosts, this feature enables superusers to set a specified upper limit on how many licensed hosts can that you can allocate to each organization.
The {ControllerName} algorithm factors changes in the limit for an organization and the number of total hosts across all organizations.
Inventory updates fail if an inventory synchronization brings an organization out of compliance with the policy.
Additionally, superusers are able to over-allocate their licenses, with a warning.
