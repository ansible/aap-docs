= Monitor device resources

You can set up monitors for device resources and define alerts when the use of these resources crosses a defined threshold. 
When the agent alerts the {RedHatEdge} service, the service sets the device status to "degraded" or "error" (depending on the severity level).

Resource monitors take the following parameters:

[width="100%",cols="45%,55%",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|MonitorType |The resource to monitor. 
Currently supported resources are "CPU", "Memory", and "Disk". 

|SamplingInterval |The interval in which the monitor samples use, specified as positive integer followed by a time unit ("s" for seconds, "m" for minutes, "h" for hours).

|AlertRules |A list of alert rules.

|Path |(Disk monitor only) The absolute path to the directory to monitor. 
Utilization reflects the filesystem containing the path, similar to df, even if itâ€™s not a mount point.

Alert rules take the following parameters:

[width="100%",cols="45%,55%",options="header",]

|Parameter |Description
|Severity |The alert rule's severity level out of "Info", "Warning", or "Critical". 
Only one alert rule is allowed per severity level and monitor.

|Duration |The duration that resource use is measured and averaged over when sampling, specified as positive integer followed by a time unit ("s" for seconds, "m" for minutes, "h" for hours). 
It must be smaller than the sampling interval.

|Percentage |The use threshold that triggers the alert, as percentage value (range 0 to 100 without the "%" sign).

|Description |A human-readable description of the alert. 
This is useful for adding details about the alert that might help with debugging. 
By default it populates the alert as : load is above >% for more than.
