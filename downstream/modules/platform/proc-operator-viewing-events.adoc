= Viewing events in the {OCPShort}

You can view events in the {OCPShort} web console to monitor for errors and troubleshoot issues. 
This helps you quickly diagnose problems by examining the status of custom resources and their related events.

You can debug by first reviewing the status conditions of the {PlatformNameShort} custom resource (CR) and then checking any nested CRs for errors.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {OCPShort} web console.
. In the navigation menu, select menu:Home[Events].
. Select your project from the project list.
. To view events for a specific resource, navigate to that resource's page. Many resource pages, such as pods and deployments, have their own *Events* tab.
. Select a resource to bring you to the *Pod Details* page. 

.Verification

Check the *Conditions* section on the *Pod details* page to confirm no errors are listed in the *Message* column.
