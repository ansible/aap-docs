= Configuring the inventory file

You can control the installation of {PlatformNameShort} with inventory files. Inventory files define the hosts and containers used and created, variables for components, and other information needed to customize the installation.

Example inventory files are provided in this document that you can copy and change to quickly get started. 

Inventory files for the {GrowthTopology} and {EnterpriseTopology} are also found in the downloaded installer package:

* The default one named `inventory` is for the {EnterpriseTopology} pattern. 

* If you want to deploy the {GrowthTopology} or all-in-one pattern you need to copy over or use the `inventory-growth` file instead.

Additionally, you can find example inventory files in link:{URLTopologies}/container-topologies[Container topologies] in _{TitleTopologies}_.

To use the example inventory files, replace the `< >` placeholders with your specific variables, and update the host names. Refer to the `README.md` file in the installation directory for more information about optional and required variables.

== Inventory file for online installation for containerized {GrowthTopology} (all-in-one)

Use the example inventory file to perform an online installation for the containerized {GrowthTopology} (all-in-one):

include::snippets/inventory-cont-a-env-a.adoc[]

== Inventory file for online installation for containerized {EnterpriseTopology}

Use the example inventory file to perform an online installation for the containerized {EnterpriseTopology}:

include::snippets/inventory-cont-b-env-a.adoc[]

.Redis configuration for an {EnterpriseTopology}
include::snippets/redis-colocation-containerized.adoc[]
* By default the `redis_mode` is set to `cluster`.
** `redis_mode=cluster`

* For more information about Redis, see link:{URLPlanningGuide}/ha-redis_planning[Caching and queueing system] in _{TitlePlanningGuide}_.

== Additional information for configuring your inventory file

For more information about the variables you can use to configure your inventory file, see link:{URLContainerizedInstall}/appendix-inventory-files-vars[Inventory file variables]

.Offline or bundled installation

* To perform an offline installation, add the following under the `[all:vars]` group:

----
bundle_install=true
# The bundle directory must include /bundle in the path
bundle_dir=<full path to the bundle directory>
----

.Configuring a HAProxy load balancer

* To configure a HAProxy load balancer in front of {Gateway} with a custom CA cert, set the following inventory file variables under the `[all:vars]` group:

----
custom_ca_cert=<path_to_cert_crt>
gateway_main_url=<https://load_balancer_url>
----

[NOTE] 
====
HAProxy SSL passthrough mode is not supported with {Gateway}.
====

.Configuring Network File System (NFS) storage for {HubName}

NFS is a type of shared storage that is supported in containerized installations. Shared storage is required when installing more than one instance of {HubName} with a `file` storage backend. When installing a single instance of the {HubName}, shared storage is optional.

* To configure shared storage for {HubName}, set the following variable in the inventory file, ensuring your NFS share has read, write, and execute permissions:

----
hub_shared_data_path=<path_to_nfs_share>
----

* To change the mount options for your NFS share, use the `hub_shared_data_mount_opts` variable. This variable is optional and the default value is `rw,sync,hard`.

.Configuring Amazon S3 storage for {HubName}

Amazon S3 storage is a type of object storage that is supported in containerized installations. When using an AWS S3 storage backend, set `hub_storage_backend` to `s3`. The AWS S3 bucket needs to exist before running the installation program.

The variables you can use to configure this storage backend type in your inventory file are:

* `hub_s3_access_key`
* `hub_s3_secret_key`
* `hub_s3_bucket_name`
* `hub_s3_extra_settings`

Extra parameters can be passed through an Ansible `hub_s3_extra_settings` dictionary.

For example, you can set the following parameters:

----
hub_s3_extra_settings:
  AWS_S3_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE: 4096
  AWS_S3_REGION_NAME: eu-central-1
  AWS_S3_USE_SSL: True
----

For more information about the list of parameters, see link:https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html#settings[django-storages documentation - Amazon S3].

.Configuring Azure Blob Storage for {HubName}

Azure Blob storage is a type of object storage that is supported in containerized installations. 
When using an Azure blob storage backend, set `hub_storage_backend` to `azure`. The Azure container needs to exist before running the installation program.

The variables you can use to configure this storage backend type in your inventory file are:

* `hub_azure_account_key`
* `hub_azure_account_name`
* `hub_azure_container`
* `hub_azure_extra_settings`

Extra parameters can be passed through an Ansible `hub_azure_extra_settings` dictionary.

For example, you can set the following parameters:

----
hub_azure_extra_settings:
  AZURE_LOCATION: foo
  AZURE_SSL: True
  AZURE_URL_EXPIRATION_SECS: 60
----

For more information about the list of parameters, see link:https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/azure.html#settings[django-storages documentation - Azure Storage].


.Loading an {ControllerName} license file

* To define the location of your {ControllerName} license file, set the following variable in the inventory file:

----
controller_license_file=<full_path_to_your_manifest_zip_file>
----

//* To define the license file as part of the postinstall process instead, see xref:using-postinstall_{context}[Using the postinstall feature of containerized {PlatformNameShort}].
