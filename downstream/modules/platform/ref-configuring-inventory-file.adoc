= Configuring the inventory file

[role="_abstract"]
You can control the installation of {PlatformNameShort} with inventory files. Inventory files define the host details, certificate details, and component-specific settings needed to customize the installation.

Example inventory files are available in this document that you can copy and change to get started.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The inventory file requirements differ based on your installation type:

* *Online installation*: Requires the `registry_username` and `registry_password` variables to authenticate and pull container images from Red Hat registries during installation.
* *Disconnected (bundled) installation*: Does not require `registry_username` or `registry_password` because all container images are pre-packaged in the bundle. Instead, requires the `bundle_install=true` and `bundle_dir` variables.

The following inventory file examples are for online installations. For disconnected installation inventory requirements, see link:{URLContainerizedInstall}/aap-containerized-disconnected-installation#perform-disconnected-installation[Performing a disconnected installation].
====

Additionally, {GrowthTopology} and {EnterpriseTopology} inventory files are available in the following locations:

* In the downloaded installation program package:
** The default inventory file, named `inventory`, is for the {EnterpriseTopology} pattern. 
** To deploy the {GrowthTopology} (all-in-one) pattern, use the `inventory-growth` file instead.
* In link:{URLTopologies}/container-topologies[Container topologies] in _{TitleTopologies}_.

To use the example inventory files, replace the `< >` placeholders with your specific variables, and update the host names. 

Refer to the `README.md` file in the installation directory or link:{URLContainerizedInstall}/appendix-inventory-files-vars[Inventory file variables] for more information about optional and required variables.

== Inventory file for online installation for containerized {GrowthTopology} (all-in-one)

Use the example inventory file to perform an online installation for the containerized {GrowthTopology} (all-in-one):

include::snippets/inventory-cont-a-env-a.adoc[]

* `ansible_connection=local` -  Used for all-in-one installations where the installation program is run on the same node that hosts {PlatformNameShort}. 
** If the installation program is run from a separate node, do not include `ansible_connection=local`. In this case, use an SSH connection instead. 
* `[database]` - This group in the inventory file defines the {PlatformNameShort} managed database.
