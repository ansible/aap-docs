= Using custom TLS certificates

[role="_abstract"]

By default, the installer generates TLS certificates and keys for all services that are signed by a custom Certificate Authority (CA). You can provide a custom TLS certificate and key for each service. If that certificate is signed by a custom CA, you must provide the CA TLS certificate and key.
