= Connect an AI agent to the Ansible MCP server 

[role="_abstract"]

Use the API token of the Ansible MCP server to connect it with your preferred AI agent, such as Claude, Cursor, or ChatGPT.

.Prerequisites

* An Ansible MCP server is deployed on your {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers} environment.
* An API token is created for your Ansible MCP server.

.Procedure
. Go to the AI tool that you want to connect to the {PlatformNameShort}.
. Follow your AI client's instructions to configure the MCP server settings. 
+
Typically, you must specify the MCP server configurations in the `mcp.json` file.
. When configuring the `mcp.json` file, add the Ansible MCP server URL in the following format:
+
`_<Ansible MCP server URL>_/_<toolset>_/mcp`
+
Key:

* *Ansible MCP server URL* = The URL of the Ansible MCP server. For example, `\https://api.example.com/`.
+
To obtain the Ansible MCP server URL, contact your organization administrator.

* *Toolset* = The toolset that you want to connect to. For example, `job_management`, `inventory_management`, `system_monitoring`, `user_management`, `security_compliance`, and `platform_configuration`.

* *Token* = The API token of the Ansible MCP server.
+
Use the following format to add details about your Ansible MCP server in the the `mcp.json` file:

[IMPORTANT]
====
Use a concise MCP server name, ideally limited to 20 characters. This is because AI agents combine the MCP server name with the tool name to create a unique identifier, and most AI agents enforce a 64-character limit on this combined identifier.
====

.Verification

* Verify that the AI tool successfully connects to the {PlatformNameShort} MCP server using the API token. 
+
In your AI agent's chat window, enter a prompt like `What MCP tools are available for my {PlatformNameShort}?`. The AI agent should return a response with a list of tools that are enabled for the {PlatformNameShort} MCP server.

.Next step

* Open a new chat in your AI agent, and enter your prompt.
+
For example: `Give me a list of my {PlatformNameShort} jobs.` A list of all your {PlatformNameShort} jobs is displayed in the AI agent's chat window.
