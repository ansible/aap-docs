= Preparing the RHEL host for containerized installation

[role="_abstract"]

.Procedure

Containerized {PlatformNameShort} runs the component services as podman based containers on top of a RHEL host. The installer takes care of this once the underlying host has been prepared. Use the following instructions for this.

. Log into your RHEL host as your non-root user.

. Run *dnf repolist* to validate only the BaseOS and appstream repos are setup and enabled on the host:
+
----
$ dnf repolist
Updating Subscription Management repositories.
repo id                                                    repo name
rhel-9-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms                           Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 for x86_64 - AppStream (RPMs)
rhel-9-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms                              Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 for x86_64 - BaseOS (RPMs)
----
+
. Ensure that these repos and only these repos are available to the host OS. If you need to know how to do this use this guide:
link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/managing_software_with_the_dnf_tool/assembly_managing-custom-software-repositories_managing-software-with-the-dnf-tool[Chapter 10. Managing custom software repositories Red Hat Enterprise Linux]

. Ensure that the host has DNS configured and can resolve hostnames and IPs using a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). This is essential to ensure services can talk to one another.

.Using unbound DNS

To configure unbound DNS refer to link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/managing_networking_infrastructure_services/assembly_setting-up-an-unbound-dns-server_networking-infrastructure-services[Chapter 2. Setting up an unbound DNS server Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9].

.Using BIND DNS

To configure DNS using BIND refer to link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/managing_networking_infrastructure_services/assembly_setting-up-and-configuring-a-bind-dns-server_networking-infrastructure-services[Chapter 1. Setting up and configuring a BIND DNS server Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9].

.Optional

To have the installer automatically pick up and apply your {PlatformNameShort} subscription manifest license, use this guide to generate a manifest file which can be downloaded for the installer: link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.4/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_operations_guide/assembly-aap-obtain-manifest-files[Chapter 2. Obtaining a manifest file Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.].
