= Preparing the {RHEL} host for containerized installation

Containerized {PlatformNameShort} runs the component services as Podman based containers on top of a {RHEL} host. Prepare the {RHEL} host to ensure a successful installation. 

.Procedure

. Log in to the {RHEL} host as your non-root user.
+
. Set a hostname that is a fully qualified domain name (FQDN):
+
----
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <your_hostname>
----
+
. Register your {RHEL} host with `subscription-manager`:
+
----
sudo subscription-manager register
----
+

. Run `sudo dnf repolist` to validate that only the BaseOS and AppStream repositories are setup and enabled on the host:
+
----
$ sudo dnf repolist
Updating Subscription Management repositories.
repo id                                                    repo name
rhel-9-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms                           Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 for x86_64 - AppStream (RPMs)
rhel-9-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms                              Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 for x86_64 - BaseOS (RPMs)
----
+
. Ensure that only these repositories are available to the {RHEL} host. For more information about managing custom repositories, see:
link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/managing_software_with_the_dnf_tool/assembly_managing-custom-software-repositories_managing-software-with-the-dnf-tool[Managing custom software repositories].

. Ensure that the host has DNS configured and can resolve host names and IP addresses by using a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). This is essential to ensure services can talk to one another.

. Install `ansible-core`:
+
----
sudo dnf install -y ansible-core
----
+
. Optional: You can install additional utilities that can be useful for troubleshooting purposes, for example `wget`, `git-core`, `rsync`, and `vim`:
+
----
sudo dnf install -y wget git-core rsync vim
----

. Optional: To have the installer automatically pick up and apply your {PlatformNameShort} subscription manifest license, follow the steps in link:{URLCentralAuth}/assembly-gateway-licensing#assembly-aap-obtain-manifest-files[Obtaining a manifest file].
