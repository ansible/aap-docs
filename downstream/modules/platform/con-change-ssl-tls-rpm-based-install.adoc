To renew or change SSL/TLS certificates for RPM-based installations, you can edit the inventory file and run the installation program.
The installation program verifies that all {PlatformNameShort} components are working. 

Alternatively, you can change the SSL/TLS certificates manually. 
This is quicker, but there is no automatic verification.

Red Hat recommends that you use the installation program to make changes to your {PlatformNameShort} deployment.
