= Restoring containerized {PlatformNameShort}

Restore your {ContainerBase} of {PlatformNameShort} from a backup.

.Prerequisites

You have done the following: 

* Logged in to the {RHEL} host as your dedicated non-root user.

.Procedure

. Go to the {PlatformName} installation directory on your {RHEL} host.

. Run the `restore` playbook:
+
----
$ ansible-playbook -i <path_to_inventory> ansible.containerized_installer.restore
----

This restores the important data deployed by the containerized installer such as:

* PostgreSQL databases
* Configuration files
* Data files

By default, the backup directory is set to `./backups`. You can change this by using the `backup_dir` variable in your `inventory` file.
