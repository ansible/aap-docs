= Restoring containerized {PlatformNameShort}

[role="_abstract"]
Restore your {ContainerBase} of {PlatformNameShort} from a backup, or to a different environment.

[NOTE]
====
When restoring {PlatformNameShort}, use the latest installation program available at the time of the restore. For example, if you are restoring a backup taken from version `2.5-1`, use the latest `2.5-x` installation program available at the time of the restore.

Restore functionality only works with the PostgreSQL versions supported by your current {PlatformNameShort} version. 
For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.5/html/containerized_installation/aap-containerized-installation#system-requirements[System requirements].
====

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to the {RHEL} host as your dedicated non-root user.
* You have a backup of your {PlatformNameShort} deployment. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.5/html/containerized_installation/aap-containerized-installation#backing-up-containerized-ansible-automation-platform[Backing up containerized {PlatformNameShort}].
* If restoring to a different environment with the same hostnames, you have performed a fresh installation on the target environment with the same topology as the original (source) environment.
* You have ensured that the administrator credentials on the target environment match the administrator credentials from the source environment.

.Procedure
. Go to the installation directory on your {RHEL} host.

. Perform the relevant restoration steps:
** If you are restoring to the same environment with the same hostnames, run the `restore` playbook:
+
----
$ ansible-playbook -i <path_to_inventory> ansible.containerized_installer.restore
----
+
This restores the important data deployed by the containerized installer such as:
+
* PostgreSQL databases
* Configuration files
* Data files
+
By default, the backup directory is set to `./backups`. You can change this by using the `backup_dir` variable in your `inventory` file.

** If you are restoring to a different environment with different hostnames, perform the following additional steps before running the `restore` playbook:
+
[IMPORTANT]
Restoring to a different environment with different hostnames is not recommended and is intended only as a workaround.
+
... For each component, identify the backup file from the source environment that contains the PostgreSQL dump file.
+
For example:
+
----
$ cd ansible-automation-platform-containerized-setup-<version_number>/backups
----
+
----
$ tar tvf gateway_env1-gateway-node1.tar.gz | grep db

-rw-r--r-- ansible/ansible 4850774 2025-06-30 11:05 aap/backups/awx.db
----
... Copy the backup files from the source environment to the target environment.
... Rename the backup files on the target environment to reflect the new node names.
+
For example:
+
----
$ cd ansible-automation-platform-containerized-setup-<version_number>/backups
----
+
----
$ mv gateway_env1-gateway-node1.tar.gz gateway_env2-gateway-node1.tar.gz
----
... For enterprise topologies, ensure that the component backup file containing the `component.db` file is listed first in its group within the inventory file.
+
For example:
+
----
$ cd ansible-automation-platform-containerized-setup-<version_number>
----
+
----
$ ls backups/gateway*

gateway_env2-gateway-node1.tar.gz
gateway_env2-gateway-node2.tar.gz
----
+
----
$ tar tvf backups/gateway_env2-gateway-node1.tar.gz | grep db

-rw-r--r-- ansible/ansible 416687 2025-06-30 11:05 aap/backups/gateway.db

$ tar tvf backups/gateway_env2-gateway-node2.tar.gz | grep db
----

$ vi inventory
