= Device targeting

[role="_abstract"]

A rollout applies only to devices that belong to a fleet. 
Each device can belong to only a single fleet. 
Since rollout definitions are done at the fleet level, the selection process determines which devices within a fleet that participate in a batch rollout based on label criteria. 

After processing all batches, all fleet devices are rolled out.

* *Labels*: Devices with specific metadata labels can be targeted for rollouts.
* *Fleet membership*: Rollouts apply only to devices within the specified fleet.
