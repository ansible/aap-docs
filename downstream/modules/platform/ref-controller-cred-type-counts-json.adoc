[role="_abstract"]
{ControllerNameStart} generates a `cred_type_counts.json` file that provides a summary of credential types and their counts in the cluster. This file is typically located in the `/var/lib/<controller_service_name>/cred_type_counts.json` path on the controller node.

The `cred_type_counts.json` file has information about different credential types in the cluster, and how many credentials exist for each type. 

The following is an example `cred_type_counts.json` file:
