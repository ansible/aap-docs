= Creating an {ControllerName} credential custom resource

Credentials authenticate the {ControllerName} user when launching jobs against machines, synchronizing with inventory sources, and importing project content from a version control system.

SSH and AWS are the most commonly used credentials. For a full list of supported credentials see the link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/using_automation_execution/controller-credentials#ref-controller-credential-types[Credential types] section of the _{TitleControllerUserGuide}_ guide.

For help with defining values you can refer to the link:https://access.redhat.com/login?redirectTo=https%3A%2F%2Faccess.redhat.com%2Fsolutions%2F7050627[OpenAPI (Swagger) file for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform API] KCS article.
