= Configuring a reverse proxy

[role="_abstract"]
You can support a reverse proxy server configuration by adding `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` to the *Remote Host Headers* field in the Systems Settings. The ``X-Forwarded-For`` (XFF) HTTP header field identifies the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through an HTTP proxy or load balancer.

USE_X_FORWARDED_PORT = True
USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST = True
