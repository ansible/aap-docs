= Configure a reverse proxy through a load balancer

[role="_abstract"]
A reverse proxy manages external requests to servers, offering load balancing and concealing server identities for added security. 
You can support a reverse proxy server configuration by adding `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` to the *Remote Host Headers* field in the Systems Settings. The ``X-Forwarded-For`` (XFF) HTTP header field identifies the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through an HTTP proxy or load balancer.
