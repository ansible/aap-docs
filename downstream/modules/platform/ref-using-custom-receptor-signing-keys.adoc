= Using custom Receptor signing keys

[role="_abstract"]
Receptor signing is enabled by default unless `receptor_disable_signing=true` is set, and an RSA key pair (public and private) is generated by the installer. However, you can give custom RSA public and private keys by setting the path variables:

----
receptor_signing_private_key=<full_path_to_private_key>
receptor_signing_public_key=<full_path_to_public_key>
----
