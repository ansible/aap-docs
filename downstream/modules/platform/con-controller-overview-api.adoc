= The ideal RESTful API
The {ControllerName} REST API is the ideal RESTful API for a systems management application, with all resources fully discoverable, paginated, searchable, and well modeled. A styled API browser enables API exploration from the API root at `\http://<server name>/api/`, showing off every resource and relation. Everything that can be done in the user interface can be done in the API.
