= Editing a user

You can modify the properties of a user account after it is created.

In upgrade scenarios, there might be pre-existing user accounts from {ControllerName} or {HubName} services. When editing these user accounts, the *User type* checkboxes indicate whether the account had service level administrator privileges. You can revoke or assign administrator permissions for the individual services and designate the user as either an *{PlatformNameShort} Administrator*, *{PlatformNameShort} Auditor* or normal user. Assigning administrator privileges to all of the individual services automatically designates the user as an *{PlatformNameShort} Administrator*. See xref:proc-controller-creating-a-user[Creating a user] for more information about user types.

To see whether a user had service level auditor privileges, you must refer to the API.

[NOTE]
====
Users previously designated as {ControllerName} or {HubName} administrators are labeled as *Normal* in the *User type* column in the xref:proc-gw-users-list-view[Users list view]. You can see whether these users have administrator privileges, from the *Edit Users* page.

[NOTE]
====
If the user account was migrated to {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 during the upgrade process and had administrator privileges for an individual service, additional User type checkboxes will be available. You can use these checkboxes to revoke or add individual privileges or designate the user as a platform administrator, system auditor or normal user.
