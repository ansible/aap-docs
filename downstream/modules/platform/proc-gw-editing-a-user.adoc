= Editing a user

[role="_abstract"]

You can change the properties of a user account after it is created.

// [[hherbly] removed for 2.6] In upgrade scenarios, there might be pre-existing user accounts from {ControllerName} or {HubName} services. When editing these user accounts, the *User type* checkboxes indicate whether the account had one of the following service level administrator privileges: 

// Automation Execution Administrator:: A previously defined {ControllerName} administrator with full read and write privileges over automation execution resources only.
// Automation Decisions Administrator:: A previously defined {EDAName} administrator with full read and write privileges over automation decision resources only.
// Automation Content Administrator:: A previously defined {HubName} administrator with full read and write privileges over automation content resources only.

// Platform administrators can revoke or assign administrator permissions for the individual services and designate the user as either an *{PlatformNameShort} Administrator*, *{PlatformNameShort} Auditor* or normal user. Assigning administrator privileges to all of the individual services automatically designates the user as an *{PlatformNameShort} Administrator*. See xref:proc-controller-creating-a-user[Creating a user] for more information about user types.

To see whether a user had service level auditor privileges, you must refer to the API.

[NOTE]
====
After upgrading to 2.6, users previously designated as {ControllerName} administrators are labeled as platform administrators in the *User type* column in the link:{URLCentralAuth}/gw-managing-access#proc-gw-users-list-view[Users list view]. {HubNameStart} administrators are labeled as *Normal* in the *User Type* column.

// [NOTE]
// ====
// If the user account was migrated to {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 during the upgrade process and had administrator privileges for an individual service, additional User type checkboxes will be available. You can use these checkboxes to revoke or add individual privileges or designate the user as a platform administrator, system auditor or normal user.
