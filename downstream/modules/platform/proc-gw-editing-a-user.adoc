= Editing a user

You can modify the properties of a user account after it is created.

// [[hherbly] removed for 2.6] In upgrade scenarios, there might be pre-existing user accounts from {ControllerName} or {HubName} services. When editing these user accounts, the *User type* checkboxes indicate whether the account had one of the following service level administrator privileges: 

// Automation Execution Administrator:: A previously defined {ControllerName} administrator with full read and write privileges over automation execution resources only.
// Automation Decisions Administrator:: A previously defined {EDAName} administrator with full read and write privileges over automation decision resources only.
// Automation Content Administrator:: A previously defined {HubName} administrator with full read and write privileges over automation content resources only.

// Platform administrators can revoke or assign administrator permissions for the individual services and designate the user as either an *{PlatformNameShort} Administrator*, *{PlatformNameShort} Auditor* or normal user. Assigning administrator privileges to all of the individual services automatically designates the user as an *{PlatformNameShort} Administrator*. See xref:proc-controller-creating-a-user[Creating a user] for more information about user types.

To see whether a user had service level auditor privileges, you must refer to the API.

[NOTE]
====
Users previously designated as {ControllerName} or {HubName} administrators are labeled as *Normal* in the *User type* column in the xref:proc-gw-users-list-view[Users list view]. You can see whether these users have administrator privileges, from the *Edit Users* page.

// [NOTE]
