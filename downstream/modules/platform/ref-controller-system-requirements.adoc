= {ControllerNameStart} system requirements

[role="_abstract"]
{ControllerNameStart} is a distributed system, where different software components can be co-located or deployed across many compute nodes.
The {Installer} provides four node types as abstractions to help you design the topology appropriate for your use case: control, hybrid, execution, and hop nodes.

Use the following recommendations for node sizing:

.Recommended Resource Sizing for {ControllerNameStart} Node Types
[cols="1,1,1,1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Node Type
|RAM (Minimum)
|vCPU (Minimum)
|Disk IOPS (Minimum)
|Storage and Notes

|**Execution Node**
|16 GB
|4 vCPU
|3000
|Runs automation. Increase RAM/CPU to increase capacity for concurrent job *forks*. Performance depends heavily on the number of jobs run simultaneously.

|**Control Node**
|16 GB
|4 vCPU
|3000
|Processes events and runs cluster jobs (e.g., project updates).
* **Storage:** 80GB minimum, with at least 20GB available under `/var/lib/awx`.
* **Storage Requirement:** Volume must be rated for a minimum baseline of 3000 IOPS.

|**Hybrid Node**
|16 GB
|4 vCPU
|3000
|A combination of Control and Execution node functions. Storage requirements generally match the Control Node.

*Control nodes*

Control nodes process events and run cluster jobs including project updates and cleanup jobs. Increasing CPU and memory can help with job event processing.

//Control nodes have the following storage requirements:

* 40GB minimum with at least 20GB available under /var/lib/awx
* Storage volume must be rated for a minimum baseline of 3000 IOPS
* Projects are stored on control and hybrid nodes, and for the duration of jobs, are also stored on execution nodes. If the cluster has many large projects, consider doubling the GB in /var/lib/awx/projects, to avoid disk space errors.

*Hop nodes*

Hop nodes serve to route traffic from one part of the {AutomationMesh} to another (for example, a hop node could be a bastion host into another network). RAM can affect throughput, CPU activity is low. Network bandwidth and latency are generally a more important factor than either RAM or CPU.

* Actual RAM requirements vary based on how many hosts {ControllerName} manages simultaneously (which is controlled by the `forks` parameter in the job template or the system `ansible.cfg` file).
To avoid possible resource conflicts, Ansible recommends 1 GB of memory per 10 forks and 2 GB reservation for {ControllerName}.
See link:{URLControllerUserGuide}/controller-jobs#controller-capacity-determination[{ControllerNameStart} capacity determination and job impact]. 
If `forks` is set to 400, 42 GB of memory is recommended.
* A larger number of hosts can be addressed, but if the fork number is less than the total host count, more passes across the hosts are required. You can avoid these RAM limitations by using any of the following approaches:
** Use rolling updates.
** Use the provisioning callback system built into {ControllerName}, where each system requesting configuration enters a queue and is processed as quickly as possible.
