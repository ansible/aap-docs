= {ControllerNameStart} system requirements

[role="_abstract"]
{ControllerNameStart} is a distributed system, where different software components can be co-located or deployed across many compute nodes.
The {Installer} provides four node types as abstractions to help you design the topology appropriate for your use case: control, hybrid, execution, and hop nodes.

Use the following recommendations for node sizing:

.Recommended Resource Sizing for {ControllerNameStart} Node Types
[cols="1,1,1,1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Node Type
|RAM (Minimum)
|vCPU (Minimum)
|Disk IOPS (Minimum)
|Storage and Notes

|**Execution Node**
|16 GB
|4 vCPU
|3000
|Runs automation. Increase RAM/CPU to increase capacity for concurrent job *forks*. Performance depends heavily on the number of jobs run simultaneously.

|**Control Node**
|16 GB
|4 vCPU
|3000
|Processes events and runs cluster jobs (e.g., project updates).
* **Storage:** 80GB minimum, with at least 20GB available under `/var/lib/awx`.
* **Storage Requirement:** Volume must be rated for a minimum baseline of 3000 IOPS.

|**Hybrid Node**
|16 GB
|4 vCPU
|3000
|A combination of Control and Execution node functions. Storage requirements generally match the Control Node.

|**Hop Node**
|16 GB
|4 vCPU
|3000
|Routes traffic within the {AutomationMesh} (e.g., bastion host). RAM can affect throughput, but CPU activity is typically low. Network latency is a more important factor than RAM or CPU.

// Rest of the supporting content follows the table:

* Actual RAM requirements vary based on how many hosts {ControllerName} manages simultaneously (which is controlled by the `forks` parameter in the job template or the system `ansible.cfg` file).
To avoid possible resource conflicts, Ansible recommends 1 GB of memory per 10 forks and 2 GB reservation for {ControllerName}.
See link:{URLControllerUserGuide}/controller-jobs#controller-capacity-determination[{ControllerNameStart} capacity determination and job impact]. 
If `forks` is set to 400, 42 GB of memory is recommended.
* A larger number of hosts can be addressed, but if the fork number is less than the total host count, more passes across the hosts are required. You can avoid these RAM limitations by using any of the following approaches:
** Use rolling updates.
** Use the provisioning callback system built into {ControllerName}, where each system requesting configuration enters a queue and is processed as quickly as possible.
** In cases where {ControllerName} is producing or deploying images.
