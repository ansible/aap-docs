= Application using `authorization code` grant type

The application `authorization code` grant type should be used when access tokens must be issued directly to an external application or service.

[NOTE]
====
You can only use the `authorization code` type to acquire an access token when using an application. 
When integrating an external web application with {ControllerName}, that web application might need to create OAuth2 Tokens on behalf of users in that other web application. 
Creating an application in {ControllerName} with the `authorization code` grant type is the preferred way to do this because:

* this allows an external application to obtain a token from {ControllerName} for a user, using their credentials.
* compartmentalized tokens issued for a particular application enables those tokens to be easily managed. For example, revoking all tokens associated with that application without having to revoke _all_ tokens in the system.

.Example
To create an application named _AuthCodeApp_ with the `authorization-code` grant type, perform a POST to the `/api/v2/applications/` endpoint:
====

{
    "name": "AuthCodeApp",
    "user": 1,
    "client_type": "confidential",
    "redirect_uris": "http://<controller>/api/v2",
    "authorization_grant_type": "authorization-code",
    "skip_authorization": false
}

The workflow that occurs when you issue a *GET* to the `authorize` endpoint from the client application with the `response_type`, `client_id`, `redirect_uris`, and `scope`:

. {ControllerNameStart} responds with the authorization code and status to the `redirect_uri` specified in the application.
. The client application then makes a *POST* to the `api/o/token/` endpoint on {ControllerName} with the `code`, `client_id`,
`client_secret`, `grant_type`, and `redirect_uri`.
. {ControllerNameStart} responds with the `access_token`, `token_type`, `refresh_token`, and `expires_in`.

For more information, and to test this flow, see link:https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/tutorial_01.html#test-your-authorization-server[Test Your Authorization Server] in the Django OAuth Toolkit.

You can specify the number of seconds an authorization code remains valid on the *System settings* page:

Requesting an access token after this duration fails. 

The duration defaults to 600 seconds (10 minutes), based on the link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[RFC6749] recommendation.

The best way to set up application integrations with using the Authorization Code grant type is to allowlist the origins for those cross-site requests. 
More generally, you must allowlist the service or application you are integrating with {ControllerName}, for which you want
to provide access tokens. 

To do this, have your Administrator add this allowlist to their local {ControllerName} settings:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES = [
    r"http://django-oauth-toolkit.herokuapp.com*",
    r"http://www.example.com*"
]
----

Where `http://django-oauth-toolkit.herokuapp.com` and `http://www.example.com` are applications requiring tokens with which to access {ControllerName}.
