= Work with permissions

The set of permissions assigned to a project (role-based access controls) that provide the ability to read, change, and administer
projects, inventories, job templates, and other elements are privileges.

To access the project permissions, select the *Access* tab of the *Projects* page. 
This screen displays a list of users that currently have permissions to this project. 

You can sort and search this list by *Username*, *First Name*, or *Last Name*.
