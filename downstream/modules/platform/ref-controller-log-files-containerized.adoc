= Accessing {ControllerName} logs for containerized {PlatformNameShort} 

[role="_abstract"]
Logs for containerized {PlatformNameShort} are not saved to specific files. The application logs are sent to the container `stdout` and handled by Podman with `journald`.

The three containers associated with {ControllerName} are:

* `automation-controller-rsyslog`
* `automation-controller-task`
* `automation-controller-web`

For more information about the purpose of each of these containers and how to inspect the logs, see link:{URLContainerizedInstall}/troubleshooting-containerized-ansible-automation-platform#diagnosing-the-problem_troubleshooting-containerized-aap[Diagnosing the problem] in _{TitleContainerizedInstall}_.
