= Building images for Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization

[role="_abstract"]

When building operating system images and disk images for Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization, you can follow the generic image building process with the following changes:

* Using late binding by injecting the enrollment certificate or the agent configuration through `cloud-init` when provisioning the virtual device.
* Adding the `open-vm-tools` guest tools to the image.
* Building a disk image of type `qcow2` instead of `iso`.

Complete the generic steps with changes to the following steps:

.Procedure

. Build an operating system image based on RHEL 9 that includes the {RedHatEdge} agent and VM guest tools but excludes the agent configuration.

. Create a file named `Containerfile` with the following content:

+
[source,bash]
----
FROM registry.redhat.io/rhel9/bootc-image-builder:latest
RUN subscription-manager repos --enable ansible-automation-platform-2.5-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms
    dnf -y install flightctl-agent && \
    dnf -y clean all && \
    systemctl enable flightctl-agent.service
RUN dnf -y install cloud-init open-vm-tools && \
    dnf -y clean all && \
    ln -s ../cloud-init.target /usr/lib/systemd/system/default.target.wants && \
    systemctl enable vmtoolsd.service
----

. *Optional:* To enable `podman-compose` application support, add the following section to the `Containerfile` file:

+
[source,bash]
----
RUN dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-9.noarch.rpm && \
    dnf -y install podman-compose && \
    dnf -y clean all && \
    systemctl enable podman.service
----
