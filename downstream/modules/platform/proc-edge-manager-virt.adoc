= Building images for Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization

When building operating system images and disk images for Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization, you can follow the generic image building process with the following changes:

* Using late binding by injecting the enrollment certificate or the agent configuration through `cloud-init` when provisioning the virtual device.
* Adding the `open-vm-tools` guest tools to the image.
* Building a disk image of type `qcow2` instead of `iso`.

Complete the generic steps with changes to the following steps:

.Procedure

. Build an operating system image based on RHEL 9 that includes the {RedHatEdge} agent and VM guest tools but excludes the agent configuration.

. Create a file named `Containerfile` with the following content:

+
[source,bash]
----
FROM registry.redhat.io/rhel9/bootc-image-builder:latest
RUN subscription-manager repos --enable rhacm-2.13-for-rhel-9-$(uname -m)-rpms && \
    dnf -y install flightctl-agent && \
    dnf -y clean all && \
    systemctl enable flightctl-agent.service
RUN dnf -y install cloud-init open-vm-tools && \
    dnf -y clean all && \
    ln -s ../cloud-init.target /usr/lib/systemd/system/default.target.wants && \
    systemctl enable vmtoolsd.service
----

. *Optional:* To enable `podman-compose` application support, add the following section to the `Containerfile` file:

+
[source,bash]
----
RUN dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-9.noarch.rpm && \
    dnf -y install podman-compose && \
    dnf -y clean all && \
    systemctl enable podman.service
----

Build, sign, and publish the `bootc` operating system image by following the generic image building process:

.Procedure

. Create a directory called `output` by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p output
----

. Generate an operating system disk image of type `vmdk` from your operating system image by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
sudo podman run --rm -it --privileged --pull=newer \
    --security-opt label=type:unconfined_t \
    -v "${PWD}/output":/output \
    -v /var/lib/containers/storage:/var/lib/containers/storage \
    registry.redhat.io/rhel9/bootc-image-builder:latest \
    --type qcow2 \
    ${OCI_IMAGE_REPO}:${OCI_IMAGE_TAG}
----

When the `bootc-image-builder` completes, you can find the disk image under `${PWD}/output/vmdk/disk.vmdk`.

Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization can download disk images from an OCI registry but it expects a container disk image instead of an OCI artifact. 

Complete the following steps to build, sign, and upload the QCoW2 disk image:

.Procedure

. Create a file called `Containerfile.qcow2` with the following content:

+
[source,bash]
----
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi:latest AS builder
ADD --chown=107:107 output/qcow2/disk.qcow2 /disk/ <1>
RUN chmod 0440 /disk/* <2>
FROM scratch
COPY --from=builder /disk/* /disk/ <3>
----
<1> Adds the QCoW2 disk image to a builder container to set the required `107` file ownership, which is the QEMU user.
<2> Sets the required `0440` file permissions. 
<3> Copies the file to a scratch image.

. Build, sign, and publish your disk image by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) "${PWD}/output"
OCI_DISK_IMAGE_REPO=${OCI_IMAGE_REPO}/diskimage-qcow2
sudo podman build -t ${OCI_DISK_IMAGE_REPO}:${OCI_IMAGE_TAG} -f Containerfile.qcow2 .
sudo podman push --sign-by-sigstore-private-key ./signingkey.private ${OCI_DISK_IMAGE_REPO}:${OCI_IMAGE_TAG}
----
