= Deduplication of hosts for `metrics-utility` reports

[role="_abstract"]
Deduplication changes how `metrics-utility` merges individual host records into countable managed nodes when building reports. Deduplication identifies identical hosts to ensure an accurate count of unique hosts. 

`metrics-utility` tracks individual hosts based on their hostnames. It tracks any entries that use the same hostname as the host. Additional deduplication strategies are also available using the following environment variable: `METRICS_UTILITY_DEDUPLICATOR=`.
