= Configure Google Cloud for increased authentication performance

[role="_abstract"]

In a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment, a high volume of traffic can lead to authentication and performance issues because of the low default port limit set on the GCP Cloud NAT gateway. 
While this configuration affects all GCP deployments, the highest risk for hitting this limit occurs when {PlatformNameShort} is deployed on OpenShift (version 4.17 and above).

The default setting for the Cloud NAT gateway's *Minimum ports per VM instance* in OpenShift installations on GCP (version 4.17 and above) is 64.
This low port limit can be quickly exhausted when {Gateway} handles concurrent external network connections, such as Single Sign-On (SSO) requests. 
When the limit is reached, it prevents new outgoing connections, causing authentication failures or severe performance degradation.
