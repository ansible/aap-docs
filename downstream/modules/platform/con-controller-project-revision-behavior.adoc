= Project revision behavior

[role="_abstract"]
{ControllerNameStart} interacts with source control management (SCM) systems to manage project revisions effectively.
When a project is configured to use an SCM system, such as Git, {ControllerName} tracks the revisions of the project files. 
This tracking allows {ControllerName} to ensure that the correct version of the project files is used during job execution.

During a project update, the revision of the default branch (specified in the *Source control branch* field of the project) is stored when updated. 
If providing a non-default *Source control branch* (not a commit hash or tag) in a job, the newest revision is pulled from the source control remote immediately before the job starts. 
This revision is shown in the *Source control revision* field of the job and its project update.

As a result, offline job runs are impossible for non-default branches. 
To ensure that a job is running a static version from source control, use tags or commit hashes. 
Project updates do not save all branches, only the project default branch.

The *Source control branch* field is not validated, so the project must update to assure it is valid. 
If this field is provided or prompted for, the *Playbook* field of job templates is not validated, and you have to launch the job template to verify presence of the expected playbook.
