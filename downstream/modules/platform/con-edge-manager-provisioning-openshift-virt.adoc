= Provision devices with {OCPVShort}

You can provision a virtual machine on {OCPVShort} by using a QCoW2 container disk image that is hosted on an OCI container registry.

If your operating system image does not already contain the {RedHatEdge} agent enrollment configuration, you can inject the configuration through the `cloud-init` user data at provisioning.
