= Edit Organizations

When editing an organization, system administrators can specify the following roles:

* One or more users as organization administrators
* One or more users as organization auditors
* One or more users (or teams) as organization members

Users and teams that are members of an organization can view their organization administrator.

Users who are organization administrators implicitly inherit all capabilities for all objects within that organization.

Users who are organization auditors implicitly inherit the read-only capability for all objects within that organization.
