= Work with job templates

A job template is a definition and set of parameters for running an Ansible job.

A job template combines an Ansible Playbook from a project and the settings required to launch it. Job templates are useful to run the same job many times. Job templates also encourage the reuse of Ansible Playbook content and collaboration between teams. For more information, see [ADD2.5 LINK][Job Templates] in the Automation controller User Guide.

Platform administrators and automation developers have the permissions to create job templates. As an automation operator you can launch job templates  and view their details.
