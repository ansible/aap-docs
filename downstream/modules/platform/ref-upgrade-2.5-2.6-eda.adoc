= {EDAName}

The following apply:

* An {EDAName} administrator (Automation Decisions Administrator) in 2.5 will be removed in the upgraded version and for this user the permissions must be reassigned manually as part of the movement process. 

* For {EDAName}, you must reset your password to log into {PlatformNameShort}. You can still use your Event-Driven Ansible username but will require new passwords.

* If an {EDAName} user with SSO exists, then they will not have to reset password and should have their permissions moved over as part of the SSO migration.
