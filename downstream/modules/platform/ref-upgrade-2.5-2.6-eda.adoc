= {EDAName}

[role="_abstract"]
When upgrading {EDAName} from version 2.5 to {PlatformVers}, users must reset their password to log in unless they use SSO. 
Administrators must manually reassign permissions for the former Automation Decisions Administrator role

The following apply:

* An {EDAName} administrator (Automation Decisions Administrator) in 2.5 will be removed in the upgraded version and for this user the permissions must be reassigned manually as part of the movement process. 

* For {EDAName}, you must reset your password to log in to {PlatformNameShort}. You can still use your {EDAName} username but will require new passwords.

* If an {EDAName} user with SSO exists, then they will not have to reset password and should have their permissions moved over as part of the SSO migration.
