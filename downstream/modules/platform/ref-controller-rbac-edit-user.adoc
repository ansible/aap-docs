= Edit Users

When editing a user, an {ControllerName} system administrator can specify the user as being either a _System Administrator_ (also referred to as the Superuser) or a _System Auditor_:

* System administratos implicitly inherit all capabilities (read/write/execute) for all objects within the environment.
* System Auditors implicitly inherit the read-only capability for all objects within the environment.
