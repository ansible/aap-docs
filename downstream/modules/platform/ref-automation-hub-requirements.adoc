= {HubNameStart} system requirements

{HubNameStart} allows you to discover and use new certified automation content from Red Hat Ansible and Certified Partners. On {HubNameMain}, you can discover and manage Ansible Collections, which are supported automation content developed by Red Hat and its partners for use cases such as cloud automation, network automation, and security automation.


[NOTE]
====
{PrivateHubNameStart}

If you install {PrivateHubname} from an internal address, and have a certificate which only encompasses the external address, this can result in an installation which cannot be used as container registry without certificate issues.

To avoid this, use the `automationhub_main_url` inventory variable with a value such as \https://pah.example.com linking to the {PrivateHubName} node in the installation inventory file.

This adds the external address to `/etc/pulp/settings.py`.
This implies that you only want to use the external address.

For information about inventory file variables, see link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_installation_guide/appendix-inventory-files-vars[Inventory file variables] in the _{PlatformName} Installation Guide_.
