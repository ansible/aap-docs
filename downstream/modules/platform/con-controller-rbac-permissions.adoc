= RBAC permissions

Each role must have a content object, for instance, the organization administrator role has a content object of the organization. 
To delegate a role, you must have administrator permission for the content object, with some exceptions that would result in you being able to reset a user's password.

*Parent* is the organization.

*Allow* is what this new permission will explicitly allow.

*Scope* is the parent resource that this new role is created on. For example: `Organization.project_create_role`.

It is assumed that the creator of the resource is given the administrator role for that resource. 
Instances where resource creation does not also imply resource administration, re explicitly called out.

The rules associated with each administrator type are as follows:

*Project Admin*

* Allow: Create, read, update, delete any project
* Scope: Organization
* User Interface: _Project Add Screen - Organizations_

*Inventory Admin*

* Parent: Org admin
* Allow: Create, read, update, delete any inventory
* Scope: Organization
* User Interface: _Inventory Add Screen - Organizations_

[NOTE]
====
As with the *Use* role, if you assign Project Administrator and Inventory Administrator roles to a user, it enables them to create Job Templates (not workflows) for your organization.
====

*Credential Admin*

* Parent: Org admin
* Allow: Create, read, update, delete shared credentials
* Scope: Organization
* User Interface: _Credential Add Screen - Organizations_

*Notification Admin*

* Parent: Org admin
* Allow: Assignment of notifications
* Scope: Organization

*Workflow Admin*

* Parent: Org admin
* Allow: Create a workflow
* Scope: Organization

*Org Execute*

* Parent: Org admin
* Allow: Executing JTs and WFJTs
* Scope: Organization

The following is a sample scenario showing an organization with its
roles and which resource(s) each have access to:
