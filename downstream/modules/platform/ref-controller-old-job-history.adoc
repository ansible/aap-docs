= Removing Old Job History

[role="_abstract"]
Over time, job history can accumulate and consume significant disk space on the {ControllerName} server. 
To manage disk space effectively, you can configure the {ControllerName} to automatically remove job history that is older than a specified number of days.

To do this, click the launch image:rightrocket.png[Launch,15,15] icon beside *Cleanup Job Details*.

image:management-jobs-cleanup-job-launch.png[management jobs - cleanup job launch]

Enter the number of days of data you want to save and click btn:[Launch].

[NOTE]
====
The initial job run for an {ControllerName} resource, such as Projects, or Job Templates, are excluded from *Cleanup Job Details*, regardless of
retention value.
====

You can review or set a schedule for cleaning up old job history by performing the same procedure described for activity stream management
jobs.
