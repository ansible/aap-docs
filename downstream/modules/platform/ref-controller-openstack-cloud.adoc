= OpenStack

[role="_abstract"]
Use this credential type to connect to OpenStack clouds.
{ControllerNameStart} uses the OpenStack SDK to interact with OpenStack clouds. 
When you create an OpenStack cloud credential, the controller prompts you for the following information:

* *Username*: The username to authenticate to the OpenStack cloud.
* *Password*: The password to authenticate to the OpenStack cloud.
* *Project name*: The project name (also called tenant name) to use when connecting to the OpenStack cloud.
* *Auth URL*: The authentication URL for the OpenStack cloud.
* *Cloud name*: The name of the cloud as defined in your OpenStack clouds.yaml file.
* *Region name* (optional): The region name to use when connecting to the OpenStack cloud.
* *Domain name* (optional): The domain name to use when connecting to the OpenStack cloud.
* *Project domain name* (optional): The project domain name to use when connecting to the OpenStack cloud.
* *Validate SSL certificate*: Select this option to validate the SSL certificate presented by the OpenStack cloud. 
Clear this option to disable SSL certificate validation.

The following sample playbook invokes the `nova_compute` Ansible OpenStack cloud module and requires credentials:

* `auth_url`
* `username`
* `password`
* `project name`

These fields are made available to the playbook through the environmental variable `OS_CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE`, which points to a YAML file written by the controller based on the contents of the cloud credential. 
The following sample playbooks load the YAML file into the Ansible variable space:

* OS_CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE example:
----
clouds:
  devstack:
    auth:
      auth_url: http://devstack.yoursite.com:5000/v2.0/
      username: admin
      password: your_password_here
