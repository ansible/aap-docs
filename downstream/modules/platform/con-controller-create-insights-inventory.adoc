= Create a Red Hat Lightspeed inventory

[role="_abstract"]
The {RHLightspeed} playbook contains a `hosts:` line where the value is the hostname supplied to {RHLightspeed}, which can be different from the hostname supplied to {ControllerName}.

// This looks like a circular reference
//To create a new inventory to use with Red Hat Insights, see xref:proc-controller-inv-source-insights[Red Hat Insights].
