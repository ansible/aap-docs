= Create an Insights inventory

[role="_abstract"]
The Insights playbook contains a `hosts:` line where the value is the host name supplied to red Hat insights, which can be different from the host name supplied to {ControllerName}

// This looks like a circular reference
//To create a new inventory to use with Red Hat Insights, see xref:proc-controller-inv-source-insights[Red Hat Insights].
