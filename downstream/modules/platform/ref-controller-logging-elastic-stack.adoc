= Elastic stack (formerly ELK stack)

[role="_abstract"]
The elastic stack is a collection of open source products for searching, analyzing, and visualizing log data in real time.

If you are setting up your own version of the elastic stack, the only change you require is to add the following lines to the logstash `logstash.conf` file:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
filter {
  json {
    source => "message"
  }
}
----

[NOTE]
====
Backward-incompatible changes were introduced with Elastic 5.0.0, and different configurations might be required depending on what version you
are using.
