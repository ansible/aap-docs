= Secret handling

{ControllerNameStart} manages three sets of secrets:

* User passwords for local {ControllerName} users.
* Secrets for {ControllerName} operational use, such as database password or message bus password.
* Secrets for automation use, such as SSH keys, cloud credentials, or external password vault credentials.

== User passwords for local users

{ControllerNameStart} hashes local {ControllerName} user passwords with the PBKDF2 algorithm using a SHA256 hash. 
Users who authenticate by external account mechanisms, such as LDAP, SAML, and OAuth, do not have any password or secret stored.
