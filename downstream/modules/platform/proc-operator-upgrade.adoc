= Upgrade the {OperatorPlatformNameShort}

[role="_abstract"]

To upgrade to the latest version of {OperatorPlatformNameShort} on {OCPShort}, you can use the following procedure:

[NOTE]
====
If you are on version 2.4, it is recommended to skip 2.5 and upgrade straight to version {PlatformVers}. 

If you upgraded from 2.4 to 2.5, you must migrate your authentication methods and users before upgrading to 2.6 as that legacy authenticator functionality was removed.
====

.Prerequisites 

* Read the {LinkReleaseNotes} for {PlatformVers}
* For existing deployments only: You must deploy your {ControllerNAme} and {HubName} instances to the same, single namespace before upgrading to {PlatformVers}. For more information see, link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7092056[Migrating from one namespace to another].
* Review the link:{URLOperatorBackup}[{TitleOperatorBackup}] guide and backup your services:
** AutomationControllerBackup
** AutomationHubBackup
** EDABackup 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Upgrading from {EDAName} 2.4 is not supported. If you are using {EDAName} 2.4 in production, contact Red{nbsp}Hat before you upgrade.
====

.Procedure

. Log in to {OCPShort}.
. Navigate to menu:Operators[Installed Operators].
. Select the {OperatorPlatformNameShort} installed on your project namespace.
. Select the *Subscriptions* tab.
. Change the channel:
.. To upgrade from version 2.4, change the channel to *stable-2.6*.
.. To upgrade from version 2.5, change the channel to *stable-2.6*.
. This creates an InstallPlan for the user.  Click btn:[Preview InstallPlan].
. Click btn:[Approve].
. Create a Custom Resource (CR) using the {PlatformNameShort} UI. The {ControllerName} and {HubName} UIs remain until all SSO configuration is supported in the {Gateway} UI.

.Verification 

You can confirm you have upgraded successfully by navigating to menu:Operators[Installed Operators], here under {PlatformNameShort} you can see the version number, begins with 2.6.x.

Additionally, go to your {OperatorPlatformNameShort} deployment and click btn:[All instances] to verify if all instances upgraded correctly. 
All pods should display either a *Running* or *Completed status*, with no pods displaying an error status.
