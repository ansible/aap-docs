= Upgrading the {OperatorPlatformNameShort}

To upgrade to the latest version of {OperatorPlatformNameShort} on {OCPShort}, you can do the following:

.Prerequisites 

* Read the link:{URLReleaseNotes}[{TitleReleaseNotes}] for 2.5 

* [Optional] You need to deploy all of your {PlatformName} services ({ControllerNAme}, {HubName}, {EDAName}) to the same, single namespace before upgrading to 2.5 (only for existing deployments). For more information see, link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7092056[Migrating from one namespace to another].
* Review the link:{URLOperatorBackup}[{TitleOperatorBackup}] guide and backup your services:
** AutomationControllerBackup
** AutomationHubBackup
** EDABackup 

.Prodedure
