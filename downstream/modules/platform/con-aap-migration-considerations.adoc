= Migration considerations


[role="_abstract"]
If you are upgrading from any version of {PlatformNameShort} older than 2.4, you must upgrade through {PlatformNameShort} first.
If you are on {OCPShort} 3 and you want to upgrade to {OCPShort} 4, you must provision a fresh {OCPShort} version 4 cluster and then migrate the {PlatformNameShort} to the new cluster.
