= Migrating normal users

[role="_abstract"]

When you upgrade from {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 to 2.5, your existing user account is automatically migrated to a single platform account. However, if you have multiple component accounts (such as, {ControllerName}, {PrivateHubName} and {EDAName}), your accounts must be linked to use the centralized features of the platform.
