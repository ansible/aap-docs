You can reference information about a job in a custom notification message using grouped curly brackets {{ }}. 
Specific job attributes are accessed using dotted notation, for example, {{ job.summary_fields.inventory.name }}. 
You can add any characters used in front or around the braces, or plain text, for clarification, such as "#" for job ID and single-quotes to denote some descriptor. 
Custom messages can include a number of variables throughout the message:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
{{ job_friendly_name }} {{ job.id }} ran on {{ job.execution_node }} in {{ job.elapsed }} seconds.
----

The following are additional variables that can be added to the template:

* `approval_node_name` - (string) The approval node name.
* `approval_status` - (choice) One of `approved`, `denied`, and `timed_out`.
* `url` - (string) The URL of the job for which the notification is emitted (this applies to `start`, `success`, `fail`, and `approval notifications`).
* `workflow_url` - (string) The URL to the relevant approval node. 
This allows the notification recipient to go to the relevant workflow job page to examine the situation.
For example, `This node can be viewed at: {{workflow_url }}`.
In cases of approval-related notifications, both `url` and `workflow_url` are the same.
* `job_friendly_name` - (string) The friendly name of the job.
* `job_metadata` - (string) The job metadata as a JSON string, for example:
