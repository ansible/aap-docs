= Recovering your {PlatformNameShort} deployment from a PVC

A persistent volume claim (PVC) is a storage volume that stores data for {HubName} and {ControllerName} applications.
These PVCs are independent of the applications and persist even if an application is deleted.
You can restore data from a PVC as an alternative to recovering from an *{PlatformNameShort}* backup.
