= Select a date range for your `RENEWAL_GUIDANCE` report

[role="_abstract"]
The default behavior of the `RENEWAL_GUIDANCE` report is to build a report for the current date. The following examples describe how to override this default behavior to select a specific date range  for your report:

The `RENEWAL_GUIDANCE` report requires a `since` parameter as the parameter is not supported due to the nature of the `HostMetric` data and is always set to `now`. To override a report date range that is already built, use parameter `-force` with the command. For more information, see the following examples:

----
# Build report for a specific date range, including the provided days
metrics-utility build_report --since=2025-03-01 

# Build report for a last 12 months from a current date
metrics-utility build_report --since=12months

# Build report for a last 12 months from a current date overwriting an existing report
metrics-utility build_report --since=12months --force
