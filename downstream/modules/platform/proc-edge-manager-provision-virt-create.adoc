Create a virtual machine that has its primary disk populated from your QCoW2 container disk image and a `cloud-init` configuration drive that is populated from your enrollment secret.

Complete the following steps:

.Procedure 

. Create a file that has the `VirtualMachine` resource manifest by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
cat <<EOF > my-bootc-vm.yaml
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: my-bootc-vm
spec:
  runStrategy: RerunOnFailure
  template:
    spec:
      domain:
        cpu:
          cores: 1
        memory:
          guest: 1024M
        devices:
          disks:
            - name: containerdisk
              disk:
                bus: virtio
            - name: cloudinitdisk
              disk:
                bus: virtio
      volumes:
        - name: containerdisk
          containerDisk:
            image: ${OCI_DISK_IMAGE_REPO}:${OCI_IMAGE_TAG}
        - name: cloudinitdisk
          cloudInitConfigDrive:
            secretRef:
              name: enrollment-secret
