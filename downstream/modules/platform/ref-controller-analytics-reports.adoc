This data helps you optimize your automation strategies and improve efficiency.

Reports for data collected are available through link:https://console.redhat.com[{Console}].

Other {Analytics} data currently available and accessible through the platform UI include the following:

*Automation Calculator* is a view-only version of the Automation Calculator utility that shows a report that represents (possible) savings to the subscriber.
