//[ddacosta - removed to reflect current environment but this might be updated in the product later and this statement could be added back.]
//Reports from collection are accessible through the {ControllerName} UI if you have superuser-level permissions.
//By including the analytics view on-prem where it is most convenient, you can access data that can affect your day-to-day work.
//This data is aggregated from the automation provided on link:https://console.redhat.com[{Console}].

Reports for data collected are available through link:https://console.redhat.com[{Console}].

Other {Analytics} data currently available and accessible through the platform UI include the following:

*Automation Calculator* is a view-only version of the Automation Calculator utility that shows a report that represents (possible) savings to the subscriber.

*Subscription Usage* reports the historical usage of your subscription. Subscription capacity and licenses consumed per month are displayed, with the ability to filter by the last year, two years, or three years.
