[role="_abstract"]
{ControllerName} can integrate with Red Hat Satellite 6 as a dynamic inventory source.

Use the following procedure to configure a Red Hat Satellite-sourced inventory.

.Procedure
. From the navigation panel, select {MenuInfrastructureInventories}.
. Select the inventory name you want a source to and click the *Sources* tab.
. Click btn:[Create source].
. In the *Create source* page,, select *Red Hat Satellite 6* from the *Source* list.
. The *Create source* window expands with additional fields.
Enter the following details:

* Optional: *Credential*: Choose from an existing Satellite Credential.
For more information, see xref:controller-credentials[Managing user credentials].
. Optional: You can specify the verbosity, host filter, enabled variables or values, and update options as described in xref:proc-controller-add-source[Adding a source].
. Use the *Source Variables* field to specify parameters used by the `foreman` inventory source.
Enter variables by using either JSON or YAML syntax.
Use the radio button to toggle between the two.
For more information about these variables, see the link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/theforeman/foreman/foreman_inventory.html[Foreman inventory source] in the Ansible documentation.

.Troubleshooting
If you meet an issue with the {ControllerName} inventory not having the "related groups" from Satellite, you might need to define these variables in the inventory source.
For more information, see xref:controller-rh-satellite[Red Hat Satellite 6].

If you see the message, `"no foreman.id" variable(s) when syncing the inventory`, see the solution on the Red Hat Customer Portal at:
