.Procedure
. In the *Create new source* page, select *Red Hat Satellite* from the *Source* list.
. The *Create Source* window expands with the required *Credential* field.
Choose from an existing Satellite Credential.
For more information, see xref:controller-credentials[Credentials].
. Optional: You can specify the verbosity, host filter, enabled variables or values, and update options as described in xref:proc-controller-add-source[Adding a source].
. Use the *Source Variables* field to specify parameters used by the `foreman` inventory source.
Enter variables using either JSON or YAML syntax.
Use the radio button to toggle between the two.
For more information on these variables, see the link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/theforeman/foreman/foreman_inventory.html[Foreman inventory source] in the Ansible documentation.

If you encounter an issue with the {ControllerName} inventory not having the "related groups" from Satellite, you might need to define these variables in the inventory source.
For more information, see xref:controller-rh-satellite[Red Hat Satellite 6].

If you see the message, `"no foreman.id" variable(s) when syncing the inventory`, refer to the solution on the Red Hat Customer Portal at:
