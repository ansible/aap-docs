.Troubleshooting
If you meet an issue with the {ControllerName} inventory not having the "related groups" from Satellite, you might need to define these variables in the inventory source.
For more information, see xref:controller-rh-satellite[Red Hat Satellite 6].

If you see the message, `"no foreman.id" variable(s) when syncing the inventory`, see the solution on the Red Hat Customer Portal at:
