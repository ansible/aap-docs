= Twilio

Twilio is a voice and SMS automation service.
When you are signed in, you must create a phone number from which the messages are sent.
You can then define a *Messaging Service* under *Programmable SMS* and associate the number you previously created with it.

You might need to verify this number or some other information before you are permitted to use it to send to any numbers. 
The *Messaging Service* does not require a status callback URL and it does not need the ability to process inbound messages.

Under your individual (or sub) account settings, you have API credentials. 
Twilio uses two credentials to determine which account an API request is coming from. 
The *Account SID*, which acts as a username, and the *Auth Token* which acts as a password.

Provide the following details to set up a Twilio notification:

* *Account token*: Enter the account token.
* *Source phone number*: Enter the number associated with the messaging service in the form of "+15556667777".
* *Destination SMS number(s)*: Enter the list of numbers you want to receive the SMS. 
It must be a 10 digit phone number.
* *Account SID*: Enter the account SID.
