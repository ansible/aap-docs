[id="ref-controller-dependencies"]

= Dependencies

Specifies dependencies to install into the final image, including `ansible-core`, `ansible-runner`, Python packages, system packages, and
Ansible Collections. 
{Builder} automatically installs dependencies for any Ansible Collections you install.

In general, you can use standard syntax to constrain package versions.
Use the same syntax you would pass to `dnf`, `pip`, `ansible-galaxy`, or any other package management utility. 
You can also define your packages or collections in separate files and reference those files in the `dependencies` section of your definition file.

The following keys are valid for this section:

[cols="20%,40%"]
|====
| *ansible_core* a| The version of the `ansible-core` Python package to be installed. 

This value is a dictionary with a single key, `package_pip`. 
The `package_pip` value is passed directly to pip for installation and can be in any format that pip supports. 
The following are some example values:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
ansible_core:
    package_pip: ansible-core
ansible_core:
    package_pip: ansible-core==2.14.3
ansible_core:
    package_pip: https://github.com/example_user/ansible/archive/refs/heads/ansible.tar.gz
----
<<<<<<< HEAD
| *ansible_runner* a| The version of the {Runner} Python package to be installed. 
=======
| *ansible_runner* a| The version of the Ansible Runner Python package to be installed. 

>>>>>>> 84dc985e (Editorial changes to Chaps 1-8 Controller UG)
This value is a dictionary with a single key, `package_pip`. 
The `package_pip` value is passed directly to pip for installation and can be in any format that pip supports. 
The following are some example values:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
ansible_runner:
    package_pip: ansible-runner
ansible_runner:
    package_pip: ansible-runner==2.3.2
ansible_runner:
    package_pip: https://github.com/example_user/ansible-runner/archive/refs/heads/ansible-runner.tar.gz
----
| *galaxy* | Ansible Collections to be installed from Galaxy. 

This can be a filename, a dictionary, or a multi-line string representation of an Ansible Galaxy `requirements.yml` file. 
For more information about the requirements file format, see the link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/galaxy/user_guide.html#install-multiple-collections-with-a-requirements-file[Galaxy User Guide].
| *python* | The Python installation requirements. 

This can be a filename, or a list of requirements. 
{Builder} combines all the Python requirements files from all collections into a single file using the `requirements-parser` library. 

This library supports complex syntax, including references to other files. 
If multiple collections require the same _package name_, {Builder} combines them into a single entry and combines the constraints.

Certain package names are specifically _ignored_ by `ansible-builder`, meaning that {Builder} does not include them in the combined
file of Python dependencies, even if a collection lists them as dependencies. These include test packages and packages that provide
Ansible itself. The full list can is available under `EXCLUDE_REQUIREMENTS` in `src/ansible_builder/_target_scripts/introspect.py`. 

If you need to include one of these ignored package names, use the `--user-pip` option of the `introspect` command to list it in the user requirements file. 

Packages supplied this way are not processed against the list of excluded Python packages.
| *python_interpreter* | A dictionary that defines the Python system package name to be installed by dnf (`package_system`) or a path to the Python interpreter to be used (`python_path)`.
| *system* | The system packages to be installed, in bindep format. 
This can be a filename, or a list of requirements.

For more information about bindep, see the link:https://docs.opendev.org/opendev/bindep/latest/readme.html[OpenDev documentation]. 

For system packages, use the `bindep` format to specify cross-platform requirements, so they can be installed by whichever package management system the {ExecEnvShort} uses.
Collections must specify necessary requirements for `[platform:rpm]`. 
{Builder} combines system package entries from multiple collections into a single file. 
Only requirements with no profiles (runtime requirements) are installed to the image. 
Entries from multiple collections which are outright duplicates of each other can be consolidated in the combined file.
|====

The following example uses filenames that contain the various dependencies:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
dependencies:
  python: requirements.txt
  system: bindep.txt
  galaxy: requirements.yml
  ansible_core:
      package_pip: ansible-core==2.14.2
  ansible_runner:
      package_pip: ansible-runner==2.3.1
  python_interpreter:
      package_system: "python310"
      python_path: "/usr/bin/python3.10"
----

This example uses inline values:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
dependencies:
  python:
    - pywinrm
  system:
    - iputils [platform:rpm]
  galaxy:
    collections:
      - name: community.windows
      - name: ansible.utils
        version: 2.10.1
  ansible_core:
      package_pip: ansible-core==2.14.2
  ansible_runner:
      package_pip: ansible-runner==2.3.1
  python_interpreter:
      package_system: "python310"
      python_path: "/usr/bin/python3.10"
----

[NOTE]
====
If any of these dependency files (`requirements.txt, bindep.txt, and requirements.yml`) are in the `build_ignore` of the collection, it does not work correctly.

Collection maintainers can verify that ansible-builder recognizes the requirements they expect by using the `introspect` command, for example:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
$ ansible-builder introspect --sanitize ~/.ansible/collections/
----
====

The `--sanitize` option reviews all of the collection requirements and removes duplicates. 
It also removes any Python requirements that are normally excluded (see *python* dependencies).

Use the `-v3` option to `introspect` to see logging messages about requirements that are being excluded.
