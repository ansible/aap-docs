= Configuration from a Git repository

You can store device configuration in a Git repository such as GitHub or GitLab.
You can then add a Git Config Provider so that the {RedHatEdge} synchronizes the configuration from the repository to the file system of the device.

The Git Config Provider takes the following parameters:

|===
|Parameter|Description
|`Repository`|The name of a `Repository` resource defined in the {RedHatEdge}.

|`TargetRevision`|The branch, tag, or commit of the repository to checkout.

|`Path`|The absolute path to the directory in the repository from which files and subdirectories are synchronized to the file system of the device.
The `Path` directory corresponds to the root directory (`/`) on the device, unless you specify the `MountPath` parameter.

|`MountPath`|Optional. The absolute path to the directory in the file system of the device to write the content of the repository to. 
By default, the value is the file system root (`/`).
|===

The `Repository` resource defines the Git repository, the protocol, and the access credentials that the {RedHatEdge} must use.
You only need to set up the repository once.
After setting up, you can use the repository to configure individual devices or device fleets.
