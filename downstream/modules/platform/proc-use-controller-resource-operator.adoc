= Using {OperatorResourceShort} 

The {OperatorResourceShort} itself does not do anything until the user creates an object. 
As soon as the user creates an *AutomationControllerProject* or *AnsibleJob* resource, the Resource Operator will start processing that object. 

.Prerequisites
* Install the Kubernetes-based cluster of your choice.
* Deploy {ControllerName} using the `automation-controller-operator`.

After installing the `automation-controller-resource-operator` in your cluster, you must create a Kubernetes (k8s) secret with the connection information for your {ControllerName} instance. 
Then you can use {OperatorResourceShort} to create a k8s resource to manage your {ControllerName} instance.
