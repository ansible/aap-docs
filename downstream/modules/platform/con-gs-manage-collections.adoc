= Manage collections in {HubName}

As a platform operator, you can use namespaces in {HubName} to curate and manage collections for the following purposes:

* Create groups with permissions to curate namespaces and upload collections to {PrivateHubName}.
* Add information and resources to the namespace to help end users of the collection in their automation tasks.
* Upload collections to the namespace.
* Review the namespace import logs to decide the success or failure of uploading the collection and its current approval status.

For more information about collections, see _link:{LinkHubManagingContent}_.
