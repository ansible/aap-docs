= Upgrading from {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 to 2.6

It is possible for customers to upgrade directly from the latest  2.4 version to {PlatformVers}. 
On startup, {PlatformVers} platform services rename their service-specific roles to platform-wide roles, as shown in the following table.

[cols="50%,50%",options="header"]
|===
| *2.4 role* | *2.6 equivalent* 
| {ControllerNameStart} auditor | Platform auditor
| {ControllerNameStart} superuser/administrator (flag) | Platform superuser/administrator (flag)
| {ControllerNameStart} organization admin | Organization administrator
| {ControllerNameStart} organization member | Organization member
| {ControllerNameStart} team admin | Team administrator
| {HubNameStart} administrator | Team member (user)
| {ControllerNameStart} team member (user) | Team member (user)
| {HubNameStart} team member (user) | Team member (user)
|===

Additionally, note the following behavior when upgrading to {PlatformVers}: 

* After upgrading, {ControllerName} entity relationships, such as user associations with organizations, teams, or role sets, remain consistent in {Gateway}. 
This applies to both existing entities moved during the upgrade and any new entities (users, teams, organizations) created in {ControllerName} and subsequently moved in a {PlatformVers} environment.

* {ControllerNameStart} user types (normal, superuser and auditor) are mapped to {Gateway} user types during the upgrade process.

* Where team names match between {HubName} and {Gateway}, for example, "Team A" exists in both, user memberships from {HubName} are transferred to the corresponding team in {Gateway}. This reduces the need to manually re-create memberships.

* If users exist only in {HubName}, they are not moved to [Gateway]. 
You must manually re-create these users after upgrading. 
However, if a user has the same username in both {ControllerName} and {HubName}, the {ControllerName} account is part of the regular data movement. 
Users who are not migrated need to have their passwords reset, but should keep the same permissions.

* Data movement also moves {PrivateHubName} but excludes {EDAName} data.

* {EDAName} users are not moved to {Gateway} and must be recreated manually after upgrading.

* {HubNameStart} users must be recreated if they cannot be moved as part of the upgrade. 
A user might not be migrated for the following reasons: 
** The user's account exists only in {HubName} and not in {ControllerName}.
** Duplicate usernames exist in both automation hub and automation controller, but they belong to different people.
** A discrepancy in the username, email, or other identifying attributes exists between the two services, which prevents the system from correctly merging the accounts.

* {HubNameStart} admins are converted to normal users if they are able to be merged with {ControllerName} users.

* The {ControllerName} UI is updated to reflect the {ControllerName} data moved as platform-level entities along with their roles.

* The {ControllerName} setting *Organization Admins Can Manage Users and Teams* applies to organization admins in {PlatformVers}.
