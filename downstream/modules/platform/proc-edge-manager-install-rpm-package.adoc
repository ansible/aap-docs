= Installing the {RedHatEdge} RPM package

[role="_abstract"]

Prepare your {RHEL} host for the installation of the {RedHatEdge} by enabling the necessary repositories, installing the `flightctl-services` package, configuring the baseDomain, and then starting and verifying the running services.

.Prerequisites

* An active {PlatformNameShort} subscription with a running instance and the necessary API URLs and OAuth credentials.
* A separate machine from {PlatformNameShort} to install the {RedHatEdge} on.
* Podman installed for managing containers.
* A {RHEL} host with:

** Minimal installation
** 4 cores and 16GB RAM (recommended)
** Administrative access (root or sudo-capable user)
** SSH access

.Procedure

. SSH into your {RHEL} host.
. Authenticate and log in to the Red Hat Container Registry:
+
----
sudo podman login registry.redhat.io
----
+
. Install the necessary repositories and packages:
** Ensure that the {PlatformNameShort} repositories are enabled by running the following example command based on the version of {RHEL} and architecture of your host:
+
[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable ansible-automation-platform-2.5-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms
----
+
** Install the {RedHatEdge} service by running: 
+
[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
sudo dnf install -y flightctl-services
----
+
. Update the installed `/etc/flightctl/service-config.yaml` to set the `baseDomain`:
+
[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
sudo vi /etc/flightctl/service-config.yaml
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that you set the `baseDomain` in the service configuration correctly. 
By default, the installation process attempts to automatically set this value based on the IP address of your {RHEL} host.

However, if your environment uses a specific domain name to access this host, for example `rhem-example.com`, it is recommended that you manually update the `baseDomain` in `/etc/flightctl/service-config.yaml` to this hostname.

Setting the `baseDomain` correctly ensures that all generated URLs, certificates, and internal configurations within the {RedHatEdge} are accurate for your network setup. 
This is especially important for integration with {PlatformNameShort} and for ensuring that the UI is accessible through the intended domain name.

You can check the currently configured `baseDomain` using:

----
grep baseDomain: /etc/flightctl/service-config.yaml
----
====
+
. Enable and start the services:
+
[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
sudo systemctl enable flightctl.target
sudo systemctl start flightctl.target
----
+
. Verify that services are running:
+
[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
sudo systemctl list-units flightctl-*.service
----
+
You should see these 7 services running:
+

* flightctl-db
* flightctl-kv
* flightctl-api
* flightctl-periodic
* flightctl-worker
* flightctl-ui
* flightctl-cli-artifacts

+
. Go to the UI at the `baseDomain` stored in the service configuration file:
+
----
grep baseDomain: /etc/flightctl/service-config.yaml
----
+
Visit the displayed `baseDomain` in your web browser to access the UI.

.Troubleshooting

If your services do not run correctly, use the following log command to troubleshoot further and remediate:

----
journalctl -u flightctl-<impacted service> -b --no-pager
----
