= GitHub Team settings

To set up social authentication for a GitHub Team, you must obtain an OAuth2 key and secret for a web application.
To do this, you must first register your team-owned application at `https://github.com/organizations/<yourorg>/settings/applications`.
To register the application, you must supply it with your Authorization callback URL, which is the *Callback URL* shown in the *Details* page.
Each key and secret must belong to a unique application and cannot be shared or reused between different authentication
backends.
The OAuth2 key (Client ID) and secret (Client Secret) are used to supply the required fields in the UI.

.Procedure
. Find the numeric team ID using the link:https://fabian-kostadinov.github.io/2015/01/16/how-to-find-a-github-team-id/[GitHub API].
The Team ID is used to supply a required field in the UI.
. From the navigation panel, select {MenuAEAdminSettings}.
. On the *Settings* page, select *GitHub settings* from the list of *Authentication* options.
. Click the *GitHub Team* tab.
+
The *GitHub Team OAuth2 Callback URL* field is already pre-populated and non-editable.
When the application is registered, GitHub displays the Client ID and Client Secret.

. Click btn:[Edit] and copy and paste GitHub's Client ID into the *GitHub Team OAuth2 Key* field.
. Copy and paste GitHub's Client Secret into the *GitHub Team OAuth2 Secret* field.
. Copy and paste GitHub's team ID in the *GitHub Team ID* field.
. For more information on completing the mapping fields, see xref:ref-controller-organization-mapping[Organization mapping] and xref:ref-controller-team-mapping[Team mapping].
. Click btn:[Save]

.Verification
To verify that the authentication was configured correctly, logout of {ControllerName}.
The login screen displays the GitHub Team logo to enable logging in with those credentials.
