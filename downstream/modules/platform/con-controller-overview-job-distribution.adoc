= Job distribution

[role="_abstract"]
Take a fact gathering or configuration job running across thousands of machines and divide it into slices that can be distributed across your {ControllerName} cluster. 
This increases reliability, offers faster job completion, and improved cluster use.

For example, you can change a parameter across 15,000 switches at scale, or gather information across your multi-thousand-node RHEL estate.

For more information, see link:{URLControllerUserGuide}/controller-job-slicing[Job slicing].
