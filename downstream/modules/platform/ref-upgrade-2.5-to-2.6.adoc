= Upgrades from {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 to 2.6

When upgrading from {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 to 2.6, existing authenticators and their mappings in the {Gateway} continue to function as they are, with no changes being imported. 
This is because the core authentication service in 2.5 is already the {Gateway}, so a migration of this data is not needed.
