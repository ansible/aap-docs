= Upgrades from {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 to {PlatformVers}

[role="_abstract"]
When upgrading from {PlatformNameShort} 2.5 to {PlatformVers}, existing authenticators and their mappings in {Gateway} continue to function as they are, with no changes being imported. 

This is because the core authentication service in 2.5 is already {Gateway}, so a migration of this data is not needed.
