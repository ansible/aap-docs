= Creating a user

You can assign two types of users: 
Normal user:: Normal users have read and write access limited to the resources (such as inventory, projects, and job templates) for which that user has been granted the appropriate roles and privileges.
System administrator:: A System administrator (also known as a Superuser) has full system administration privileges — with full read and write privileges over the entire installation. A System administrator is typically responsible for managing all aspects of and delegating responsibilities for day-to-day work to various users.
Select the Organization to be assigned for this user. For information about creating a new organization or team, refer to xref:proc-controller-create-organization[Creating an organization].
