[role="_abstract"]

The API server is a core part of the {RedHatEdge} service that gives users and agents an option to communicate with the service.

The API server exposes the following endpoints:

User-facing API endpoint:: Users can connect to the user-facing API endpoint from the CLI or the web console.
Users must authenticate on the {Gateway} to obtain a JSON Web Token (JWT) to make HTTPS requests.

Agent-facing API endpoint:: Agents connect to the agent-facing endpoint, which is mTLS-protected.
The service authenticates devices by using the X.509 client certificates.

The {RedHatEdge} service also communicates with various external systems to authenticate and authorize users, get mTLS certificates signed, or query configuration for managed devices.
