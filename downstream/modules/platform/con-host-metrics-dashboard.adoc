= Host Metrics dashboard

[role="_abstract"]
The Host Metrics dashboard provides high level automation run details per managed host, including:

* The first and last time a host was automated.
* The number of times automation has been run or attempted to be run against a host.
* The number of times a managed host has been deleted.

Use the ability to view the number of times automation has been run on hosts to:

* View your most commonly automated hosts.
* More accurately reflect the scope of your automation landscape.

To view your host metrics, in the navigation pane, select {MenuAAHostMetrics}.
