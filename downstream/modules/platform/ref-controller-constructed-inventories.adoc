//As Smart inventories are deprecated, I'm removing comparisons from the source text. 
You can create a new inventory (called a constructed inventory) from a list of input inventories. 

A constructed inventory has copies of hosts and groups in its input inventories, permitting jobs to target groups of servers across many inventories. 
Groups and hostvars can be added to the inventory content, and hosts can be filtered to limit the size of the constructed inventory. 

Constructed inventories use the link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/constructed_inventory.html#ansible-builtin-constructed-inventory-uses-jinja2-to-construct-vars-and-groups-based-on-existing-inventory[ansible.builtin.constructed inventory] model.

The key factors of a constructed inventory are:

* The normal Ansible hostvars namespace is available
* They provide groups

//Smart inventories take a `host_filter` as input and create a resultant inventory with hosts from inventories in its organization. 
Constructed inventories take `source_vars` and `limit` as inputs and transform its `input_inventories` into a new inventory, complete with groups. Groups (existing or constructed) can then be referenced in the `limit` field to reduce the number of hosts produced.

You can construct groups based on these host properties:

* RHEL major or minor versions
* Windows hosts
* Cloud based instances tagged in a certain region
* other

//The following is an example of a constructed inventory details view:

The examples described in later sections are organized by the structure of the input inventories.
