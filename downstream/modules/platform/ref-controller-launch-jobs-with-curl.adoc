= Launching Jobs with curl

Launching jobs with the {ControllerName} API is simple. 

The following are some easy to follow examples using the `curl` tool.

Assuming that your Job Template ID is '1', your controller IP is 192.168.42.100, and that `admin` and `awxsecret` are valid login credentials, you can create a new job this way:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
curl -f -k -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -XPOST \
    --user admin:awxsecret \
    https://192.168.42.100/api/v2/job_templates/1/launch/
----

This returns a JSON object that you can parse and use to extract the 'id' field, which is the ID of the newly created job.
You can also pass extra variables to the Job Template call, as in the following example:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
curl -f -k -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -XPOST \
    -d '{"extra_vars": "{\"foo\": \"bar\"}"}' \
    --user admin:awxsecret https://192.168.42.100/api/v2/job_templates/1/launch/
----

//You can view the live API documentation by logging into http://192.168.42.100/api/ and browsing around to the various objects available.
//No you can't
[NOTE]
====
The `extra_vars` parameter must be a string which contains JSON, not just a JSON dictionary. 
Use caution when escaping the quotes, etc.
