= Self-signed certificates

[role="_abstract"]

The {RedHatEdge} services automatically generate and store self-signed certificates in the `/etc/flightctl/pki` directory. 
These include:

* `/etc/flightctl/pki/ca.crt`
* `/etc/flightctl/pki/ca.key`
* `/etc/flightctl/pki/client-enrollment.crt`
* `/etc/flightctl/pki/client-enrollment.key`
* `/etc/flightctl/pki/server.crt`
* `/etc/flightctl/pki/server.key`

You can use your own custom certificates by placing them in the following locations:

* Custom Server Certificate/Key Pair:
** `/etc/flightctl/pki/server.crt`
** `/etc/flightctl/pki/server.key`
* Custom CA Certificate for {PlatformNameShort} authentication:
** `/etc/flightctl/pki/auth/ca.crt`

[NOTE]
====
Ensure that you adjust the `insecureSkipTlsVerify` setting in the `service-config.yaml` if you use a custom CA certificate for your {PlatformNameShort} instance.
