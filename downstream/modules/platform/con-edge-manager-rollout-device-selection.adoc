= Rollout device selection

[role="_abstract"]

When performing a rollout by using `flightctl`, you must manage which devices participate in the rollout and how much disruption is acceptable. 
The device selection process and the rollout disruption budget concept ensure controlled and predictable rollouts.

The process and configuration for selecting devices during a rollout includes targeting strategies, batch sequencing, and success criteria for controlled software deployment.
