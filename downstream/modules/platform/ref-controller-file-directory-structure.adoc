= Ansible file and directory structure

If you are creating a common set of roles to use across projects, these should be accessed through source control submodules, or a common location such as `/opt`. 
Projects should not expect to import roles or content from other projects.

For more information, see the link https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/tips_tricks/ansible_tips_tricks.html[General tips] from the Ansible documentation. 

[NOTE]
====
* Avoid using the playbooks `vars_prompt` feature, as {ControllerName} does not interactively permit `vars_prompt` questions. 
If you cannot avoid using `vars_prompt`, see the xref:controller-surveys-in-job-templates[Surveys in job templates] functionality.

* Avoid using the playbooks `pause` feature without a timeout, as {ControllerName} does not permit canceling a pause interactively.
If you cannot avoid using `pause`, you must set a timeout.
====

Jobs use the playbook directory as the current working directory, although jobs must be coded to use the `playbook_dir` variable rather than relying on this.
