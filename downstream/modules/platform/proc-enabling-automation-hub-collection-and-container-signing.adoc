= Enabling automation content collection and container signing

[role="_abstract"]
Automation content signing is disabled by default. To enable it, the following installation variables are required in the inventory file:

[source,yaml]
----
# Collection signing
hub_collection_signing=true
hub_collection_signing_key=<full_path_to_collection_gpg_key>

# Container signing
hub_container_signing=true
hub_container_signing_key=<full_path_to_container_gpg_key>
----

The following variables are required if the keys are protected by a passphrase:

[source,yaml]
----
# Collection signing
hub_collection_signing_pass=<gpg_key_passphrase>

# Container signing
hub_container_signing_pass=<gpg_key_passphrase>
----

The `hub_collection_signing_key` and `hub_container_signing_key` variables require the set up of keys before running an installation. 

Automation content signing currently only supports GnuPG (GPG) based signature keys. For more information about GPG, see the link:https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manpage.html[GnuPG man page].

The algorithm and cipher used is the responsibility of the customer.

.Procedure

. On a RHEL server run the following command to create a new key pair for collection signing:
+
----
gpg --gen-key
----
+
. Enter your information for "Real name" and "Email address":
+
Example output:
+
----
gpg --gen-key

There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

Note: Use "gpg --full-generate-key" for a full featured key generation dialog.

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Joe Bloggs
Email address: jbloggs@example.com
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Joe Bloggs <jbloggs@example.com>"

Change (N)ame, (E)mail, or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
----
+
If this fails, your environment does not have the necessary prerequisite packages installed for GPG. Install the necessary packages to proceed.  
+
. A dialog box will appear and ask you for a passphrase. This is optional but recommended.
. The keys are then generated, and produce output similar to the following:
+
----
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

Note the expiry date that you can set based on company standards and needs.

. You can view all of your GPG keys by running the following command:
+
----
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long
----
+
. To export the public key run the following command:
+
----
gpg --export -a --output collection-signing-key.pub <email_address_used_to_generate_key>
----
+
. To export the private key run the following command:
+
----
gpg -a --export-secret-keys <email_address_used_to_generate_key> > collection-signing-key.priv
----
+
. If a passphrase is detected, you will be prompted to enter the passphrase.
. To view the private key file contents, run the following command:
+
----
cat collection-signing-key.priv

. Repeat steps 1 to 9 to create a key pair for container signing. 
. Add the following variables to the inventory file and run the installation to create the signing services:
