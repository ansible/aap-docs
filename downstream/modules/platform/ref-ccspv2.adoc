= CCSPv2

CCSPv2 is a report which shows the following:

* Directly and indirectly managed node usage
* The content of all inventories
* Content usage 

The primary use of this report is for partners under the link:https://connect.redhat.com/en/programs/certified-cloud-service-provider[CCSP] program, but all customers can use it to obtain on-premise reporting showing managed nodes, jobs and content usage across their {ControllerName} organizations.

Set the report type using `METRICS_UTILITY_REPORT_TYPE=CCSPv2`.

== Optional collectors for `gather` command

You can use the following optional collectors for the `gather` command:

* `main_jobhostsummary`
** If present by default, this incrementally collects data from the `main_jobhostsummary` table in the {ControllerName} database, containing information about jobs runs and managed nodes automated.
* `main_host`
** This collects daily snapshots of the `main_host` table in the {ControllerName} database and has managed nodes and hosts present across {ControllerName} inventories.
* `main_jobevent`
** This incrementally collects data from the `main_jobevent` table in the {ControllerName} database and contains information about which modules, roles, and Ansible collections are being used.
* `main_indirectmanagednodeaudit`
** This incrementally collects data from the `main_indirectmanagednodeaudit` table in the {ControllerName} database and contains information about indirectly managed nodes.

# Example with all optional collectors
export METRICS_UTILITY_OPTIONAL_COLLECTORS="main_host,main_jobevent,main_indirectmanagednodeaudit"

== Optional sheets for `build_report` command

You can use the following optional sheets for the `build_report` command:

* `ccsp_summary`
** This is a landing page specifically for partners under CCSP program.
This report takes additional parameters to customize the summary page. For more information, see the following example:

export METRICS_UTILITY_PRICE_PER_NODE=11.55 # in USD
export METRICS_UTILITY_REPORT_SKU=MCT3752MO
export METRICS_UTILITY_REPORT_SKU_DESCRIPTION="EX: Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform, Full Support (1 Managed Node, Dedicated, Monthly)"
export METRICS_UTILITY_REPORT_H1_HEADING="CCSP NA Direct Reporting Template"
export METRICS_UTILITY_REPORT_COMPANY_NAME="Partner A"
export METRICS_UTILITY_REPORT_EMAIL="email@email.com"
export METRICS_UTILITY_REPORT_RHN_LOGIN="test_login"
export METRICS_UTILITY_REPORT_PO_NUMBER="123"
export METRICS_UTILITY_REPORT_END_USER_COMPANY_NAME="Customer A"
export METRICS_UTILITY_REPORT_END_USER_CITY="Springfield"
export METRICS_UTILITY_REPORT_END_USER_STATE="TX"

----
* `jobs`
** This is a list of {ControllerName} jobs launched. It is grouped by job template.
* `managed_nodes`
** This is a deduplicated list of managed nodes automated by {ControllerName}.
* `indirectly_managed_nodes`
** This is a deduplicated list of indirect managed nodes automated by {ControllerName}.
* `inventory_scope`
** This is a deduplicated list of managed nodes present across all inventories of {ControllerName}.
* `usage_by_organizations`
** This is a list of all {ControllerName} organizations with several metrics showing the organizations usage. This provides data suitable for doing internal chargeback.
* `usage_by_collections`
** This is a list of Ansible collections used in a {ControllerName} job runs.
* `usage_by_roles`
** This is a list of roles used in {ControllerName} job runs.
* `usage_by_modules`
** This is a list of modules used in {ControllerName} job runs.
* `managed_nodes_by_organization`
** This generates a sheet per organization, listing managed nodes for every organization with the same content as the managed_nodes sheet.
* `data_collection_status`
** This generates a sheet with the status of every data collection done by the `gather` command for the date range the report is built for. 

To outline the quality of data collected it also lists: 

*** unusual gaps between collections (based on collection_start_timestamp)
*** gaps in collected intervals (based on since vs until)

# Example with all optional sheets
export METRICS_UTILITY_OPTIONAL_CCSP_REPORT_SHEETS='ccsp_summary,jobs,managed_nodes,indirectly_managed_nodes,inventory_scope,usage_by_organizations,usage_by_collections,usage_by_roles,usage_by_modules,data_collection_status'

== Filtering reports by organization
To filter your report so that only certain organizations are present, use this environment variable with a semicolon separated list of organization names.

`export METRICS_UTILITY_ORGANIZATION_FILTER="ACME;Organization 1"`

This renders only the data from these organizations in the built report. This filter currently does not have any effect on the following optional sheets: 

* `usage_by_collections` 
* `usage_by_roles`
* `usage_by_modules`

== Selecting a date range for your CCSPv2 report

The default behavior of the CCSPv2 report is to build a report for the previous month. The following examples describe how to override this default behavior to select a specific date range for your report:  

----
# Build report for a specific month
metrics-utility build_report --month=2025-03 

# Build report for a specific date range, icluding the prvided days
metrics-utility build_report --since=2025-03-01 --until=2025-03-31

# Build report for a last 6 months from a current date
metrics-utility build_report --since=6months

# Build report for a last 6 months from a current date overriding an exisitng report
metrics-utility build_report --since=6months --force
