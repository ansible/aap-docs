= Creating an authentication method

. xref:gw-configure-auth-details[Authentication details], where you configure the authentication details for the plugin you selected.
. xref:gw-define-rules-triggers[Mapping], where you define mapping rule types and triggers to control access to the system.
. xref:gw-adjust-mapping-order[Mapping order], where you can define the mapping precedence.

[NOTE]
