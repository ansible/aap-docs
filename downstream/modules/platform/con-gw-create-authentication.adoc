= Creating an authentication method

The *Create Authentication* wizard guides you through the steps to create a new authentication method for your organization. The wizard is launched during the create authentication process.

There are 5 procedures involved in creating an authenticator, including:

. xref:gw-select-auth-type[Authentication type], where you will select the type of authenticator plugin you want to configure.
. xref:gw-configure-auth-details[Authentication details], where you will configure the authentication details for the plugin you selected.
. xref:gw-define-rules-triggers[Mapping], where you will define mapping rule types and triggers to control access to the system.
. xref:gw-adjust-mapping-order[Mapping order], where you can define the mapping precedence.

[NOTE]
====
Mapping order is only available if there are one or more authenticator maps defined.

. xref:gw-review-auth-settings[Review], where you can review and confirm the authentication settings before creating the authentication method.
