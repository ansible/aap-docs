= Creating an authentication method

The *Create Authentication* wizard guides you through the steps to create a new authentication method for your organization. The wizard is launched during the create authentication process.

There are 5 procedures involved in creating an authenticator, including:

. xref:gw-configure-auth-details_gw-auth-wizard[Authentication details], where you will configure the authentication details for the plugin you selected.
. xref:gw-define-rules-triggers_gw-auth-wizard[Mapping], where you will define mapping rule types and triggers to control access to the system.
. xref:gw-adjust-mapping-order_gw-auth-wizard[Mapping order], where you can define the mapping precedence.
