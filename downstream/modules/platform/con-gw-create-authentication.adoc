Creating an authenticator involves the following procedures:

* xref:gw-select-auth-type[Selecting an authentication type], where you select the type of authenticator plugin you want to configure, including the authentication details for the authentication type selected.
* xref:gw-define-rules-triggers[Mapping], where you define mapping rule types and triggers to control access to the system, and xref:gw-adjust-mapping-order[Mapping order], where you can define the mapping precedence.
