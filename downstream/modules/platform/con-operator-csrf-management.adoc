= {OperatorPlatformNameShort} CSRF management

In {PlatformNameShort} version {PlatformVers} the {OperatorPlatformNameShort} on {OCPShort} creates OpenShift Routes and configures your Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) settings automatically. When using external ingress, you must configure your CSRF on the ingress, for help with this see link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/installing_on_openshift_container_platform/configure-aap-operator_operator-platform-doc#proc-operator-config-csrf-gateway_configure-aap-operator[Configuring your CSRF settings for your {Gateway} operator ingress].

[IMPORTANT]
====
In previous versions CSRF was configurable through the {controllerName} user interface, in version {PlatformVers} {controllerName} settings are still present but have no impact on CSRF settings for the {Gateway}.

The following table helps to clarify which settings are applicable for which component.
