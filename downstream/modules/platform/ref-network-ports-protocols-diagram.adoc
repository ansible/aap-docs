= Network ports and protocols diagram

[role="_abstract"]
The following architectural diagrams are example of a fully deployed {PlatformNameShort} with all possible components.

[NOTE]
====
In some of the following use cases, hop nodes are used instead of a direct link from an execution node. 
Hop nodes are an option for connecting control and execution nodes. 
Hop nodes use minimal CPU and memory, so vertically scaling hop nodes does not impact system capacity.
====

*RPM based installations*

[NOTE]
====
The following diagram shows client initiated connections between {PlatformNameShort} components.
Direct connections shown in the diagram between the Client and {HubName}, {EDAName}, and {ControllerName} only apply when systems are upgraded from {PlatformName} 2.4 to {PlatformName} {PlatformVers}.
This provides backward compatibility.

The following diagram shows internally initiated connections between {PlatformNameShort} components for new installs {PlatformName} {PlatformVers}.

*Container-based installations*

[NOTE]
====
The following diagram shows connections between {PlatformNameShort} components for a container-based installation {PlatformName} {PlatformVers}.

**Containerized {PlatformNameShort} network ports and protocols**
