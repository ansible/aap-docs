= Adding tokens

Add tokens through the menu:Access[Users] page. 
Tokens can be associated with an application from the User's page. 
Specifying an application can be performed in the User's token settings. 
You can create a token for _your_ username in the Tokens configuration tab, meaning only you can create and see your tokens in your own user screen. 

Use the following procedure to add a token:

.Procedure
. From the navigation panel, select menu:Access[Users].
. Select the user for which you want to configure the OAuth 2 tokens.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can only create OAuth 2 Tokens for your user through the API or UI, which means you can only access your own user profile to configure or view your tokens. 
If you are an system administrator and have to create or remove tokens for other users, see the revoke and create commands in the
[Token and session management] section of the _Automation Controller Administration Guide_
====
. Select the *Tokens* tab on the user's profile.
. When no tokens are present, the *Tokens* screen prompts you to add them:
. Click btn:[Add] to open the *Create Token* window.
. Enter the following details:

* *Application*: enter the name of the application with which you want to associate your token. 
Alternatively, you can search for it by clicking the image:search.png[Search,15,15] icon. 
This opens a separate window that enables you to choose from the available options. 
Use the Search bar to filter by name if the list is extensive. 
Leave this field blank if you want to create a Personal Access Token (PAT) that is not linked to any application.
* Optional: *Description*: provide a short description for your token.
* *Scope* (required): specify the level of access you want this token to have.

. Click btn:[Save], or click btn:[Cancel] to abandon your changes.

. After the token is saved, the newly created token for the user is displayed with the token information and when it expires.
