= Using the Command Generator

The Command Generator is used to generate commands for launching operational playbooks provided by the Ansible-on-clouds operational playbook collection.

The process involves five steps:

. Pull the `ansible-on-clouds-ops`` container image.
. List the available playbooks.
. Use a command generator to generate a data file and the next command to run.
. Populate the data file and launching the previous generated command.
This generates the final command with all parameters.
+
[NOTE]
====
When this step is complete, you can save the generated command and run the playbook when it is required.
====
+
. Running the final command.

`command_generator_vars` and the command_generator are implemented using a docker container and are launched using the docker command line interface..

The docker image is available at:
