= Configure {AWSPrivateLink}

[role="_abstract"]
{AWSPrivateLink} establishes secure connectivity between your VPC and the Red Hat managed control plane without traversing the public internet.

*1. {PlatformNameShort} control plane ingress (VPC to control plane)*

This configuration allows your internal users and automation to access the {PlatformNameShort} UI and API over PrivateLink.
To request Ingress PrivateLink: 
. Submit a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/#/case/new/open-case?caseCreate=true[Customer support] case to Red Hat. 
. Include your AWS *Account ID*, *Region*, and *Deployment URL*. 
. After Red Hat provides you with a VPC Endpoint Service Name, you must create a VPC Endpoint in your AWS account that points to the provided service name.

Subject: 
Request for Ingress PrivateLink Connection: <Your Company Name> - <Deployment ID>

Body: 
Hello Red Hat Support,

We would like to enable Ingress PrivateLink connectivity for our AAP on AWS instance. This will allow our internal users and automation tools to access the AAP Control Plane (UI/API) securely from our VPC without traversing the public internet.

Deployment details:
AAP Deployment Name/ID: <for example., ans-123456>
AAP Deployment URL: <for example, https://ans-123456.ansible.redhat.com>
Our Network Information:
Our AWS Account ID: <Your 12-digit AWS Account ID>
Target Region: <for example, us-east-1>

Action required:
Please create the Endpoint Service configuration on the Control Plane side and provide us with the VPC Endpoint Service Name so we can create the interface endpoint in our VPC.

Thank you.

*2. Control Plane Egress (control plane to customer VPCs)*

This configuration allows the {PlatformNameShort} control plane to connect to your private resources, such as internal Git or {PrivateHubName}.

To initiate this, you must submit a *separate* support case for "Egress PrivateLink", after which Red Hat will request approval to connect to your VPC Endpoint Service.

Subject: 
Egress PrivateLink Configuration for <Instance ID>

Body:
We need to enable Egress PrivateLink connectivity to allow the AAP control plane to access our internal private resources (for example, private automation hub, Git and so on).

Configuration details:
Our AWS Account ID: <Your 12-digit AWS Account ID>
Our Endpoint Service Name: <e.g., com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-svc-xxxxxxxx>
Service Regions/AZs: <e.g., us-east-1 / us-east-1a, us-east-1b>

Action required:
Please confirm when Red Hat has initiated the connection request so we can approve it in our AWS Console.

Thank you.

Additionally, an Internal DNS Configuration is required and is the responsibility of your Internal Network/IT Team. 

To ensure users route through the secure PrivateLink connection, you must request a Split-Horizon DNS configuration. 
You must copy the *Egress PrivateLink request template*, fill in your specific VPC Endpoint DNS Name (found in your AWS Console), and submit it to your internal IT/Network ticketing system.
