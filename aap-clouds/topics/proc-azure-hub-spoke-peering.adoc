= Hub-and-spoke peering process

[role="_abstract"]
Understand the necessary preparation and three core steps for enabling private network communication after deploying the managed application.

.Prerequisites

* You have deployed {AAPonAzureNameShort}.
* You have configured and tested an Azure VNet hub-and-spoke implementation in your Azure tenant. This prerequisite requires many Azure resources to be configured, including a Virtual Network Gateway.
* You have configured transit routing between your spoke networks, including your VPNs. Refer to link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-peering-gateway-transit[Configure VPN gateway transit for virtual network peering] in the Microsoft Azure documentation for instructions.
* You have identified the following:
** The CIDR blocks of your existing VNets (including VPNs and direct connects) that need access to {AAPonAzureNameShort} UIs.
** The CIDR blocks of your existing VNets (including VPNs and direct connects) that  contain hosts or endpoints for {AAPonAzureNameShort}.
** The CIDR blocks of the {AAPonAzureNameShort} VNet from the managed resource group of the application. Refer to link:{BaseURL}/ansible_on_clouds/2.x/html-single/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_on_microsoft_azure_guide/index#proc-azure-find-cluster-cidr_azure-hub-spoke-peering[Finding the CIDR Block of the managed resource group] for instructions.

Before peering any networks, ensure that there is no network address space overlap between your private VNets and your {AAPonAzureNameShort} network.

.Procedure

. Find the CIDR Block for the {AAPonAzureNameShort} managed application Kubernetes cluster. See link:{BaseURL}/ansible_on_clouds/2.x/html-single/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_on_microsoft_azure_guide/index#proc-azure-find-cluster-cidr_azure-hub-spoke-peering[Finding the CIDR Block of the managed application Kubernetes cluster].
. Configure Network Peering with the {PlatformNameShort} Subnet. See link:{BaseURL}/ansible_on_clouds/2.x/html-single/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_on_microsoft_azure_guide/index#proc-azure-nw-peering-aap-subnet_azure-hub-spoke-peering[Configuring Network Peering with the {PlatformNameShort} Subnet].
. Update the route tables:
.. Configure route tables from your existing networks to send traffic to the managed application CIDR. You must add routes to the routing tables of every network requesting {PlatformNameShort} user interfaces and of every network that will have automation performed against its resources.
See link:{BaseURL}/ansible_on_clouds/2.x/html-single/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_on_microsoft_azure_guide/index#proc-azure-route-to-azure_azure-hub-spoke-peering[Routing to {AAPonAzureNameShort}].
.. Configure routing to your VNets for each spoke network that you would like {PlatformNameShort} to communicate with, for automation or for accessing the user interfaces.
See link:{BaseURL}/ansible_on_clouds/2.x/html-single/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_on_microsoft_azure_guide/index#proc-azure-route-to-vnets_azure-hub-spoke-peering[Routing to your VNets].
