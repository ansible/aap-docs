= Configuring direct network peering

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure network peering between your Azure network and your VNet in the *Virtual Networks* page of the Azure Portal. 

Within the Azure console, the Azure virtual network is known as _this virtual network_, and the VNet that you want to peer with is known as _remote virtual network_.

In the *Virtual Networks* page in the Azure portal, use the following settings to configure the Azure network and the VNet that you want to peer with the {AAPonAzureNameShort} app:

.Procedure

. Under *Remote virtual network*, select the settings for the virtual network that you want to peer with Azure:
* *Summary*:
** *Peering link name*: _<aap_to_hub_peering_link_name>_
** *Subscription*: Select the subscription where you deployed the {AAPonAzureNameShort}.
** *Virtual network*: Select the {AAPonAzureNameShort} virtual network: vnet-<aap_identifier>-<region>
* *Peering settings*:
** *Traffic to remote virtual network*: _Allow_
** *Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network*: _Allow_
** *Virtual network gateway or Route Server*: _Use the remote virtual network’s gateway or Route server_
. Under *Local virtual network*, select the settings the {AAPonAzureNameShort} virtual network:
* *Summary*:
** *Peering link name*: _<hub_to_aap_peering_link_name>_
** *Traffic to remote virtual network*: _Allow_
** *Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network*: _Allow_
** *Enable this virtual network to use peered vnet's remote gateway or Route Sever*: _Enabled_
. After you have configured direct network peering, traffic routes between {AAPonAzureNameShort} and private hosts and IPs on your Vnet.
