= Set up a custom domain

[role="_abstract"]
{PlatformNameShort} control plane is accessible through its user interfaces, APIs, and mesh ingresses. While each service instance has an auto-generated Red Hat URL, you can set up a custom domain. This customization process varies based on whether you plan to use {AWSPrivateLink} or not. 

To use custom domains, you must configure three DNS records according to your service's connectivity model. These records will be explained in greater detail in the following sections. The conventions for these records are:

* `platform.<optional_subdomain._exampledomain_.com>`
* `mesh-ingress-0.<optional_subdomain._exampledomain_.com>`
* `mesh-ingress-1.<optional_subdomain._exampledomain_.com>`

You can create custom subdomains under the domain you own.
