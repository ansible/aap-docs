= Execution plane strategy

[role="_abstract"]

Red Hat strongly advises provisioning your own execution nodes and instance groups in your VPC.

* *Cost Impact:* Workloads running on the control plane trigger auto-scaling of vCPUs, which are billed at a higher variable rate ($0.10/vCPU/hr). 
For more information see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7133854[Ansible Automation Platform Service on AWS: Infrastructure Metering Changes].
* *Recommendation:* To maintain predictable costs and security isolation, use the control plane for management only and offload automation execution to your own EC2 instances.
