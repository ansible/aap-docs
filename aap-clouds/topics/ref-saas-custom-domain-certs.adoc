= Custom domain and certificates

[role="_abstract"]
You can augment the default `ansible.redhat.com` URL with your own domain (for example, `aap.company.com`).

*Certificate Requirements*
You must provide the TLS certificate and ensure it meets these criteria:

* *Validity:* Minimum 1 year expiration.
* *Private Key:* Must be unencrypted (cannot have a passphrase).
* *Renewal:* You must initiate a renewal support ticket at least 14 days before expiration.

*Subject Alternative Name (SAN) Requirements*
The certificate must be valid for the following records. You must use a wildcard (for example, `*.aap.company.com`) or explicitly list these three SANs:

* `platform.<your-domain>` (Main URL)
* `mesh-ingress-0.<your-domain>`
* `mesh-ingress-1.<your-domain>`

*Configuration Workflow*

. *Generate Certificate:* Ensure the certificate meets the SAN and private key requirements.
. *Submit Support Case:* Attach the Certificate and private key (using the secure upload link provided by support).
. *SRE Configuration:* Red Hat SRE configures the custom domain and updates the CSRF allowlists.
. *Update DNS:* Red Hat provides a target CNAME. 
You must update your DNS to point <your-domain> to the Red Hat CNAME.

[NOTE]
====
If the domain is internal-only, ensure it is resolvable by all users and execution nodes.
