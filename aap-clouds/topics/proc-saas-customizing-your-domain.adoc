= Planning for your custom domain

[role="_abstract"]
To set up a custom domain for your deployment, you must complete several preparatory steps, including domain identification and TLS certificate creation.
This procedure outlines the necessary planning activities to ensure a successful custom URL configuration with Red Hat SRE assistance.


.Prerequisites
* Ensure that you have management over the domain or subdomain you intend to use in order to add multiple records.
* Ensure the DNS servers that you use to resolve the record must be accessible wherever you intend to use the domain.
* Ensure that you use the same domain for all URLs in the deployment (for example, use `exampledomain.com` for custom URLs). 


.Procedure

. Identify the domain or subdomain that you intend to use.
. Create the TLS certificate. 
.. To ensure the validity of a TLS certificate for a custom domain, you must confirm that the certificate is generated for the platform record and all mesh-ingress records are included in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) parameter. Alternatively, you can opt to generate a wildcard certificate to cover the subdomains of your primary custom domain.

[IMPORTANT]
====
TLS Certificate requirements for custom domains:

* Initial setup: When providing a new certificate, it must have an expiration date of at least one year or longer. This is a requirement for our certificate management process.
* Renewal: You are responsible for monitoring your certificate's expiration. To ensure uninterrupted service, you must begin the support process to renew it at least 14 days before it expires.
====
+
. Open a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/#/case/new/get-support?caseCreate=true[support ticket] with Red Hat requesting a custom URL configuration to your deployment and supply the following information:
* Company Name
* Deployment information (for example, `cus-xxxx`)
* Custom domain (for example, `_exampledomain_.com`)

. Allow the SRE team to apply the configuration to your deployment, verify the functionality, and collaborate with you on follow-up steps via the support ticket.
. After your configuration is complete, apply the custom domain to your deployment.
+
[NOTE]
====
Your original mesh-ingresses will not be available; new ones using the custom domain are created instead.

. Reconfigure your execution nodes if you configured them previously with the old domain.
