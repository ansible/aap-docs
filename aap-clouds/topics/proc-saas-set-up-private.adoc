= Accept a private offer

[role="_abstract"]
A private offer is sent to you directly from a Red{nbsp}Hat seller. A private offer includes specific pricing and licensing terms for your account and has an expiration date. If you do not accept the offer by that date, you will either be moved to the public offer for the product or no longer subscribed to it.
