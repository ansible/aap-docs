You can access the control plane through the {PlatformNameShort} user interfaces and APIs.

During the initial configuration of an {SaaSonAWSShort} deployment, you will receive the URL for your deployment. You can also find this information through the Red{nbsp}Hat Hybrid Cloud Console (HCC).

The administrator account's initial password is provided to the HCC user who performed the initial deployment.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must change this initial password immediately after your first login to {PlatformNameShort}.
====
If you need help accessing your deployment, submit a support request through link:https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/#/case/new/get-support?caseCreate=true[Red Hat Customer Portal].

[NOTE]
=====
You can provide a custom URL for your {SaaSonAWSShort} by using a domain name that you own. To request a custom domain name for your deployment, you can submit a customer support request to initiate the configuration process. The Red Hat SRE team will engage the support ticket for collaboration on next steps. Refer to the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/ansible_on_clouds/2.x/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_service_on_aws/saas-service-definition#con-saas-custom-domain[Custom Domain] section for configuration information.
