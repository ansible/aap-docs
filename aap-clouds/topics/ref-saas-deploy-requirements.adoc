= Prerequisites and execution strategy

[role="_abstract"]
Before initiating these configuration requests, ensure the following are available.

* *Access:* You have access to Red Hat Customer Portal (link:https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/#/case/new/open-case?caseCreate=true[Customer support]) and the AWS Console.
* *Infrastructure:* You have an active {PlatformNameShort} Service on AWS deployment.
* *Network:* You have an existing VPC with private subnets (for PrivateLink).
* *DNS:* You have administrative access to your public or private DNS provider.

*Execution plane strategy*

Red Hat strongly advises provisioning your own execution nodes and instance groups in your VPC.

* *Cost Impact:* Workloads running on the control plane trigger auto-scaling of vCPUs, which are billed at a higher variable rate ($0.10/vCPU/hr). 
For more information see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7133854[Ansible Automation Platform Service on AWS: Infrastructure Metering Changes].
* *Recommendation:* To maintain predictable costs and security isolation, use the control plane for management only and offload automation execution to your own EC2 instances.
