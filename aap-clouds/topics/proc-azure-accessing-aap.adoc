= Configure access

[role="_abstract"]
When you initiate the deployment of the {PlatformName} managed app from Azure marketplace, a form displays in the *Create Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure* window.
Complete the form to provision {PlatformNameShort} infrastructure and resources into your Azure tenant.

.Procedure

. In a web browser, navigate to the *Managed Applications* section in the Azure console.
. Select the instance of {AAPonAzureNameShort} that you deployed.
. Select *Parameters and Outputs* in the *Settings* section in the left navigation menu.
* If this is your first time accessing your {PlatformNameShort} through the Azure portal, you must select and copy the deploymentEngineUrl under the *output* section to continue setting up your deployment. After you set up your instance through the deploymentEngineUrl, it is removed from the outputs section because it is no longer needed.
* If you have already set up your {PlatformNameShort} deployment, you can go directly to it by copying the platformUrl output. 
. Paste the selected URL into your browser search bar and hit enter. This brings you to your {PlatformNameShort} deployment.
. The first time you log in to {PlatformNameShort} with the URL, you must configure the subscription. For help see the _Logging in for the first time_ section of the link:{URLGettingStarted}[{TitleGettingStarted}] guide.
