= Updates and maintenance

[role="_abstract"]
Automation mesh execution nodes are designed to minimize the need for patching the execution plane when the control plane is updated.
However, future updates to the technology will require customer involvement to update the components in each execution plane node.

When patches are needed, customers should follow the process for updating an automation mesh node.
For help with updating your receptor see the _Updating Receptors_ section of the link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/automation_mesh_for_managed_cloud_or_operator_environments/index[Automation mesh for managed cloud or operator environments].
