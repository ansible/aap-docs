= Plan your network configuration

When you deploy {AAPonAzureNameShort}, you can configure the following networks in the `Networking` tab of the form:

* The networking address range (CIDR block) for the VNet that your {AAPonAzureNameShort} application uses.

Plan your networking configuration before you deploy the {AAPonAzureNameShort} application, because you cannot change it after deployment.
