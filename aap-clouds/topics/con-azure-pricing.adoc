= {AAPonAzureNameShort} pricing tier

[role="_abstract"]

As of December 16, 2024, Microsoft has adjusted the API, quotas, and limits of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster tiers.

All {AAPonAzureNameShort} deployments will move from the AKS *Free tier* to the *Standard tier* as part of infrastructure changes when upgrading to {PlatformNameShort} 2.5.
This transition aligns the management requirements of {AAPonAzureNameShort} deployments to the proper Azure solution. 
This change increases the Azure infrastructure costs as the new infrastructure is added to the offering.
