Subject: 
Request for Ingress PrivateLink Connection: <Your Company Name> - <Deployment ID>

Body: 
Hello Red Hat Support,

We would like to enable Ingress PrivateLink connectivity for our AAP on AWS instance. This will allow our internal users and automation tools to access the AAP Control Plane (UI/API) securely from our VPC without traversing the public internet.

Deployment details:
AAP Deployment Name/ID: <for example., ans-123456>
AAP Deployment URL: <for example, https://ans-123456.ansible.redhat.com>
Our Network Information:
Our AWS Account ID: <Your 12-digit AWS Account ID>
Target Region: <for example, us-east-1>

Action required:
Please create the Endpoint Service configuration on the Control Plane side and provide us with the VPC Endpoint Service Name so we can create the interface endpoint in our VPC.

Thank you.
