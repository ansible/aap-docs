[id="saas-execution-plane"]

= Run automation at scale through the execution plane

[role="_abstract"]
You can only run test and cleanup jobs on the default or controller execution planes. All other automation must be configured to run on your execution plane.

As part of the {SaaSonAWSShort} subscription, you receive 10 {RHEL} (RHEL) entitlements for running the execution plane. Additional RHEL or OpenShift licenses can be purchased separately.
