[id="proc-gcp-prepare-upgrade-aap-platform-stack"]

= Preparing upgrade of your {PlatformNameShort} stack

.Procedure

. Create the directories used to configure the upgrade process using the following commands:
+
[source,bash]
----
# Secrets directory. Store the GCP credentials file.
$ mkdir secrets
# Extra vars directory. All the configuration variables for the upgrade process.
$ mkdir extra_vars
----
+
. Store your service account credential JSON file in the secrets directory. 
+
[NOTE]
=====
To create the GCP credentials file, see
link:https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials[Create credentials] and 
link:https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete[Create and delete service account keys].
=====
+
. The extra_vars.yml file contains the following input variables:
* `gcp_service_account_credentials_json_path` is the service account credential json file path for the Google cloud account.  
This is the path within an `ansible-on-clouds-ops` container where the credentials JSON file is mounted to the `secrets/directory`. 
The path should be `/secrets/<service-account-creds-json-filename>`. 
+
Replace `<service-account-creds-json-filename>` with your Google service account credential filename.

* `gcp_deployment_name` is the deployment name that you want to upgrade.
* `gcp_compute_region` is the GCP region that you provided when deploying foundation deployment. 
If you have not provided a region when deploying the foundation, use the default region `us-east1` here.
* `gcp_compute_zone` is the GCP zone that you provided when deploying foundation deployment. 
If you have not provided a zone when deploying the foundation, use the default `us-east1-b` here.
* `gcp_backup_taken` is the verification that a manual backup of the current deployment was recently created prior to running this upgrade. 
Use true here to verify a recent backup was created.
+
[NOTE]
=====
You can find the region and zone from the filestore instance deployed with the foundation deployment. 
Look for the filestore with the name `<deployment-name>-filestore`.

* Make note of the location field that is your `gcp_compute_zone`. 
For example, the filestore instance location might be `us-east1-d`

* Remove the last two characters from the location that is your `gcp_compute_region`. 
For example, if your `gcp_compute_zone` location is `us-east1-d`, your region is `us-east1`.

    └── gc-ansible-cloud-123434.json
----
+
. Pull the `ansible-on-clouds-ops 2.3` container image with the same tag version as the foundation deployment.

[source,bash]
----
$ export IMAGE=registry.redhat.io/ansible-on-clouds/ansible-on-clouds-ops-rhel8:2.3.20230221
$ docker pull $IMAGE
----

For EMEA regions (Europe, Middle East, Africa) run the following command instead:

[source, bash]
----
$ export IMAGE=registry.redhat.io/ansible-on-clouds/ansible-on-clouds-ops-emea-rhel8:2.3.20230221
$ docker pull $IMAGE
