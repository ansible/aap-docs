= Modifying the application CIDR range before deployment

If you access {PlatformNameShort} through VPC peering, this enables your private network to look into and communicate with other private networks.
Because these private networks can overlap, they have CIDR configurations which need to be validated before deployment so as to avoid IP conflicts in the network.

The default CIDR block for the VPC is divided into 4 subnets (2 private and 2 public), which have the following CIDR ranges:

.Private
192.168.0.0/24

192.168.1.0/24

.Public
192.168.2.0/24

192.168.3.0/24
