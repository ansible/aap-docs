= Ansible and podman configuration

The file `/aap/bootstrap/config_file_templates/<controller|hub>/monitoring.yaml` on {ControllerName} or {HubName} contains the configuration for collecting and sending Ansible and podman metrics to GCP.

The default configuration for {ControllerName} looks like this:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
# This value will be set at deployment time.
# Set to zero if monitoringEnabled is false otherwise 59s
# The collection interval for each collector will be the minimum
# between the defaultCollectorInterval and all send Interval
# of a given collector
# NB: The awx exported should not run on controllers as
# it duplicates the number of records sent to GCP Monitoring

defaultCollectorInterval: $DEFAULT_COLLECTOR_INTERVAL
collectors:
- name: podman
 endpoint: http://localhost:9882/podman/metrics
 enabled: true

# list of metrics to exclude
# excludedMetrics:
# - podman_container_created_seconds

 metrics:
 - name: podman_container_exit_code
   # interval on which the metric must be pushed to gcp
   sendInterval: 59s
----

The default configuration for {HubName} looks like:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
# This value will be set at deployment time.
# Set to zero if monitoringEnabled is false otherwise 59s
# The collection interval for each collector will be the minimum
# between the defaultCollectorInterval and all sendInterval
# of a given collector
# NB: The awx exporter should not run on controllers as
# it duplicates the number of records sent to GCP Monitoring

defaultCollectorInterval: 59s
collectors:
- name: awx
 userName: admin
 endpoint: http://<Controller_LB_IP>/api/v2/metrics/
 enabled: true
 metrics:
 - name: awx_inventories_total
   # interval on which the metric must be pushed to gcp
   sendInterval: 59s
- name: podman
 endpoint: http://localhost:9882/podman/metrics
 enabled: true

# list of metrics to exclude
#  excludedMetrics:
#  - podman_container_created_seconds

 metrics:
 - name: podman_container_exit_code
   # interval on which the metric must be pushed to gcp
   sendInterval: 59s

where `collectors` is a configuration array with one item per collector, that is, `awx` and podman.

The awx collector requires authentication and so `userName` must be set to `admin`.
The password is retrieved from the secret-manager.

The endpoint should not be changed.

`defaultCollectorInterval` specifies the default interval at which the exporter collects the information from the metric end-point and sends it to {GCP} Monitoring.

Setting this value to `0` or omitting this attribute disables all collectors.

Each collector can be enabled or disabled separately by setting `enabled` to `true` or `false`.

A collector returns all available metrics grouped by families, but you can exclude the families that should not be sent to {GCP} Monitoring by adding their name in the array `excludedMetrics`.

For all other family metrics, you can specify the interval at which you want to collect and send them to the {GCP} Monitoring.
The collector interval is the minimum between all family metrics interval and the `defaultCollectorInterval`.
This to ensure that a collection is made for each set of metrics sent to {GCP} Monitoring.
