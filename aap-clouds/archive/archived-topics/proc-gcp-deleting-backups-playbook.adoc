= Delete backups

There are two playbooks to delete backups:

* Use the `gcp_backup_delete` playbook which deletes a single backup.
* Use the `gcp_backups_delete` playbook which deletes multiple backups at once.

`gcp_backups_delete` takes a array of strings ["backup1","backup2",...], while `gcp_backup_delete` takes only one string, that being the name of a specific backup, "backup1".

The use of `gcp_backups_delete` is described in this section.

.Procedure
. Populate the `command_generator_data` directory with the configuration file template.

[NOTE]
====
On Linux, any file or directory created by the command generator is owned by `root:root` by default. To change the ownership of the files and directories, you can run the `sudo chmod` command after the files are created. For more information, read xref:con-tech-note-linux-files-owned-by-root[Command generator - Linux files owned by root].

. After running the command, a `$(pwd)/command_generator_data/backups_delete.yml` template file is created.
This template file resembles the following:

    backup_names:

    gcp_bucket_backup_name:
----

The `backup_names` parameter must specify an array of strings, for example, `["backup1","backup2"]`.
The `delete` parameter must be set to `true` to successfully delete.

. To delete the backups, run the command generator to generate the `gcp_backups_delete`` command.
