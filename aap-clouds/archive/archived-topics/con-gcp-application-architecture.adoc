= Application architecture

{PlatformName} from {GCPMarket} is installed into infrastructure resources running within your GCP account.

There are four virtual machines included in this product listing.  
Three n2-standard-2 virtual machines make up the permanent compute components of the solution.  
Additionally, a single ephemeral e2-medium instance is used to run {PlatformName} and Google Cloud deployment workloads. 
This virtual machine is only used during deployment and then is permanently removed from the solution.  
The infrastructure cost for the ephemeral VM is charged at the hourly rate during the periiod that the VM exists, usually less than an hour.

{AAPonGCP} is designed to be private, with no public access allowed by default. 

This requires customers to expose the deployed _Internal Load Balancers_ (ILBs) themselves pursuant to their own network requirements and security practices. Some potential ways to expose the ILBs include VPC Peering, Transit Gateway, VPN, External Load Balancers, amongst others. 

All cloud infrastructure components are deployed in a _Virtual Private Cloud_ (VPC). 

Customers can choose between deploying into an existing VPC, or to have the product deploy a new VPC for them. 
All VM instances and Cloud infrastructure have private IP addresses (allocation determined by the VPC and subnetworks specified at deployment time) by default. 

All internal traffic is encrypted using self-signed certificates generated at deployment time (external traffic can also be encrypted by deploying your own certificate on the Internal Load Balancers deployed by the product). 

The {PlatformNameShort} software runs as containers on the deployed VM instances.  

_Managed instance groups_ (MIGs) manage VM instance lifecycles and monitor the health of each service running on the VM instances, automatically cycling the VM instances down and replacing them with new VM instances if the health check fails to respond, ensuring that the {PlatformNameShort} services stays up and available to process requests. 

The VM instances run a customized _RedHat Enterprise Linux_ (RHEL) Google Cloud Machine Image as their base image. 
This Google Cloud Machine Image is preloaded with all the required container images and packages to run the {PlatformNameShort} ({HubName}, {ControllerName}, and Execution Node components).

A shared Google File Store (GFS) volume is mounted into each VM instance provisioned by the product and is used for shared access to common files and resources. 

A Google Cloud SQL Service is provisioned by the product at deployment time and contains databases for both the {ControllerName} and {HubName}.

The Foundation product includes two Execution Nodes running on the same VM instances as the {ControllerName} components (this is called a Hybrid Node configuration in {PlatformNameShort}). 
Additional Execution Node offerings can be purchased to increase the scale (total number of managed nodes) the {PlatformNameShort} deployment is licensed to automate.  
When deploying the Execution Node offerings into an existing {PlatformNameShort} Foundation deployment, additional Execution Node VM instances can be deployed and automatically connected to the {ControllerName} of the Foundation deployment where they immediately begin processing automation tasks. 

{PlatformNameShort} components are run as containers using the Podman container runtime on the VM instances. 
The Podman runtime configuration is managed as a system service using `systemd` to ensure uptime and availability, and restarting any failed containers automatically.

SELinux is enabled on the VM instances and is supported down to the container level. 

Additional operational automations are provided by the offering, available as a separate docker container for download from {Registry}.  
These additional operational automations include backup, restore, and upgrade. 

Any _Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures_ (CVEs) found in the RHEL OS base image, the {PlatformNameShort} containers, or any included packages are addressed during upgrade of the {PlatformNameShort} offering by swapping out the base RHEL Google Cloud Machine Image with a newer version including all required software, packages, and containers. 

This is done automatically for you through the use of the included upgrade automation.

Customers can take advantage of these operational automations to simplify the operational readiness of {PlatformNameShort} within their own corporate standards freeing themselves up to focus on developing Ansible Automation to manage their own infrastructure and applications rather than spending time developing automations to manage {PlatformNameShort}.
