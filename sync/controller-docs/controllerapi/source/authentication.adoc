supports a number of authentication methods to make it easy to embed the
controller into existing tools and processes to help ensure the right
people can access controller resources.

[[api_session_auth]]
=== Session Authentication

Session authentication is used when logging in directly to ’s API or UI
to manually create resources (inventory, project, job template) and
launch jobs in the browser. With this method, you can remain logged in
for a prolonged period of time, not just for that HTTP request, but for
instance, when browsing the UI or API in a browser like Chrome or
Firefox. When a user logs in, a session cookie is created, which enables
the user to remain logged in when navigating to different pages within
the . Below represents the communication that occurs between the client
and server in a session.

Using the curl tool, you can see the activity that occurs when you log
into the controller.

[arabic]
. GET to the `/api/login/` endpoint to grab the `csrftoken` cookie.

....
curl -k -c - https://<controller-host>/api/login/

localhost   FALSE   /   FALSE   0   csrftoken   
AswSFn5p1qQvaX4KoRZN6A5yer0Pq0VG2cXMTzZnzuhaY0L4tiidYqwf5PXZckuj
....

[arabic, start=2]
. POST to the `/api/login/` endpoint with username, password, and
X-CSRFToken=<token-value>.

....
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--referer https://<controller-host>/api/login/ \
-H 'X-CSRFToken: K580zVVm0rWX8pmNylz5ygTPamgUJxifrdJY0UDtMMoOis5Q1UOxRmV9918BUBIN' \
--data 'username=root&password=reverse' \
--cookie 'csrftoken=K580zVVm0rWX8pmNylz5ygTPamgUJxifrdJY0UDtMMoOis5Q1UOxRmV9918BUBIN' \
https://<controller-host>/api/login/ -k -D - -o /dev/null
....

All of this is done by the when you log in to the UI or API in the
browser, and should only be used when authenticating in the browser. For
programmatic integration with , see `api_oauth2_auth`.

A typical response might look like:

....
Server: nginx
Date: <current date>
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 0
Connection: keep-alive
Location: /accounts/profile/
X-API-Session-Cookie-Name: awx_sessionid
Expires: <date>
Cache-Control: max-age=0, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, private
Vary: Cookie, Accept-Language, Origin
Session-Timeout: 1800
Content-Language: en
X-API-Total-Time: 0.377s
X-API-Request-Id: 700826696425433fb0c8807cd40c00a0
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: X-API-Request-Id
Set-Cookie: userLoggedIn=true; Path=/
Set-Cookie: current_user=<user cookie data>; Path=/
Set-Cookie: csrftoken=<csrftoken>; Path=/; SameSite=Lax
Set-Cookie: awx_sessionid=<your session id>; expires=<date>; HttpOnly; Max-Age=1800; Path=/; SameSite=Lax
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15768000
....

When a user is successfully authenticated with this method, the server
will respond with a header called `X-API-Session-Cookie-Name`,
indicating the configured name of the session cookie. The default value
is `awx_session_id` which you can see later in the `Set-Cookie` headers.

Note

The session expiration time can be changed by specifying it in the
`SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` parameter. Refer to `ag_session_limits` for further
detail.

=== Basic Authentication

Basic Authentication (Basic Auth) is stateless, thus the base64-encoded
`username` and `password` must be sent along with each request via the
Authorization header. This can be used for API calls from curl requests,
python scripts, or individual requests to the API. `api_oauth2_auth` is
recommended for accessing the API when at all possible.

Example with curl:

....
curl -X GET -H 'Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA==’ https://<controller-host>/api/v2/credentials -k -L

# the --user flag adds this Authorization header for us
curl -X GET --user 'user:password' https://<controller-host>/api/v2/credentials -k -L
....

For more information about the Basic HTTP Authentication scheme, see
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7617[RFC 7617].

Note

You can disable the Basic Auth for security purposes from the
Miscellaneous Authentication settings of the controller UI Settings
menu:

[[api_oauth2_auth]]
=== OAuth 2 Token Authentication

OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for token-based
authentication and authorization. OAuth 2 authentication is commonly
used when interacting with the controller API programmatically. Like
Basic Auth, an OAuth 2 token is supplied with each API request via the
Authorization header. Unlike Basic Auth, OAuth 2 tokens have a
configurable timeout and are scopable. Tokens have a configurable
expiration time and can be easily revoked for one user or for the entire
system by an admin if needed. This can be done with the
`ag_manage_utility_revoke_tokens` management command, which is covered
in more detail in or by using the API as explained in
`ag_oauth2_token_revoke`.

Note

By default, external users such as those created by SSO are not allowed
to generate OAuth tokens for security purposes. This can be changed from
the Miscellaneous Authentication settings of the controller UI Settings
menu:

image:../../common/source/images/configure-tower-external-tokens-off.png[image]

The different methods for obtaining OAuth 2 Access Tokens in are:

* Personal access tokens (PAT)
* Application Token: Password grant type
* Application Token: Implicit grant type
* Application Token: Authorization Code grant type

For more information on the above methods, see `ag_oauth2_token_auth` in
the .

First, a user needs to create an OAuth 2 Access Token in the API or in
their User’s *Tokens* tab in the UI. For further detail on creating them
through the UI, see `ug_users_tokens`. For the purposes of this example,
use the PAT method for creating a token in the API. Upon token creation,
the user can set the scope.

Note

The expiration time of the token can be configured system-wide. See
`ag_use_oauth_pat` for more detail.

Token authentication is best used for any programmatic use of the API,
such as Python scripts or tools like curl, as in the example for
creating a PAT (without an associated application) below.

*Curl Example*

....
curl -u user:password -k -X POST https://<controller-host>/api/v2/tokens/
....

This call will return JSON data like:

image:../../common/source/images/api_oauth2_json_returned_token_value.png[image]

The value of the `token` property is what you can now use to perform a
GET request for an resource, e.g., Hosts.

....
curl -k -X POST \
  -H “Content-Type: application/json”
  -H “Authorization: Bearer <oauth2-token-value>” \
  https://<controller-host>/api/v2/hosts/ 
....

Similarly, you can launch a job by making a POST to the job template
that you want to launch.

....
curl -k -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <oauth2-token-value>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"limit" : "ansible"}' \
  https://<controller-host>/api/v2/job_templates/14/launch/ 
....

*Python Example*

https://pypi.org/project/awxkit/[awxkit] is an open source tool that
makes it easy to use HTTP requests to access the API. You can have
awxkit acquire a PAT on your behalf by using the `awxkit login` command.
Refer to the
https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/controllercli/index.html[AWX
Command Line Interface] for more detail.

For more information on how to use OAuth 2 in the in the context of
integrating external applications, see `ag_oauth2_token_auth` in the .

If you need to write custom requests, you can write a Python script
using https://pypi.org/project/requests/[Python library requests], like
in this example:

....
import requests
oauth2_token_value = 'y1Q8ye4hPvT61aQq63Da6N1C25jiA'   # your token value from controller
url = 'https://<controller-host>/api/v2/users/'
payload = {}
headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + oauth2_token_value,}

# makes request to controller user endpoint
response = requests.request('GET', url, headers=headers, data=payload,
allow_redirects=False, verify=False)

# prints json returned from controller with formatting
print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=4, sort_keys=True))        
....

[[api_sso_auth]]
=== SSO Authentication

Single sign-on (SSO) authentication methods are fundamentally different
from other methods because the authentication of the user happens
external to the , like Google SSO, Azure SSO, SAML, or GitHub. For
example, with GitHub SSO, GitHub is the single source of truth, which
verifies your identity based on the username and password you gave the
controller.

You can configure SSO authentication using the inside a large
organization with a central Identity Provider. Once you have configured
an SSO method in the controller, a button for that SSO will be present
on the login screen. If you click that button, it will redirect you to
the Identity Provider, in this case GitHub, where you will present your
credentials. If the Identity Provider verifies you successfully, then
the controller will make a user linked to your GitHub user (if this is
your first time logging in via this SSO method), and log you in.

For the various types of supported SSO authentication methods, see
`ag_social_auth` and `ag_ent_auth` in the .
