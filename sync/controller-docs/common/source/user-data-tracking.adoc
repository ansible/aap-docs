== Usability Analytics and Data Collection

Usability data collection is included with Tower to collect data to
better understand how Tower users specifically interact with Tower, to
help enhance future releases, and to continue streamlining your user
experience.

Only users installing a trial of Tower or a fresh installation of Tower
are opted-in for this data collection.

If you want to change how you participate in this analytics collection,
you can opt out or change your settings in the *User Interface
settings*, by clicking *Settings* from the left navigation bar.

Ansible Tower collects user data automatically to help improve the Tower
product. You can control the way Tower collects data by setting your
participation level in the *User Interface settings* in the Settings
menu.
