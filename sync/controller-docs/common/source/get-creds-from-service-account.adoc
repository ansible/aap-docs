A `ContainerGroup` is simply an `InstanceGroup` that has an associated
Credential that allows for connecting to an OpenShift cluster. To set up
a container group, you must first have the following:

* A namespace you can launch into (there is a "default" namespace but
most likely varied by customer)
* A service account that has the roles that allow it to launch and
manage Pods in this namespace
* If you will be using in a private registry, and have a Container
Registry credential associated to them in the automation controller, the
service account also needs the roles to get, create, and delete secrets
in the namespace. If you do not want to give these roles to the service
account, you can pre-create the `ImagePullSecrets` and specify them on
the pod spec for the ContainerGroup. In this case, the should NOT have a
Container Registry credential associated, or the controller will attempt
to create the secret for you in the namespace.
* A token associated with that service account (OpenShift or Kubernetes
Bearer Token)
* A CA certificate associated with the cluster

Here is an example of how to create a service account and collect the
needed information for configuring :

[arabic]
. Download and use this example,
`containergroup sa <../../common/source/containergroup-sa.yml>`, to
obtain the above credentials.
. Apply the configuration from `containergroup-sa.yml`:
+
....
oc apply -f containergroup-sa.yml
....
. Get the secret name associated with the service account:
+
....
export SA_SECRET=$(oc get sa containergroup-service-account -o json | jq '.secrets[0].name' | tr -d '"')
....
. Get the token from the secret:
+
....
oc get secret $(echo ${SA_SECRET}) -o json | jq '.data.token' | xargs | base64 --decode > containergroup-sa.token
....
. Get the CA cert:
+
....
oc get secret $SA_SECRET -o json | jq '.data["ca.crt"]' | xargs | base64 --decode > containergroup-ca.crt
....
. Use the contents of `containergroup-sa.token` and
`containergroup-ca.crt` to provide the information for the
`ug_credentials_ocp_k8s` required for the container group.
