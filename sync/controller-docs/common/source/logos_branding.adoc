automation controller supports the use of a custom logo. You can add a
custom logo by uploading an image; and supply a custom login message
from the *User Interface settings* of the Settings menu.

For the custom logo to look its best, use a `.png` file with a
transparent background. GIF, PNG, and JPEG formats are supported.

If needed, you can add specific information (such as a legal notice or a
disclaimer) to a text box in the login modal by adding it to the *Custom
Login Info* text field.

For example, if you uploaded a specific logo, and added the following
text:

image:configure-tower-ui-logo-filled.png[image]

The Tower login dialog would look like this:

Selecting `Revert` will result in the appearance of the standard
automation controller logo.
