see https://access.redhat.com/articles/3331481.

[[attach_subscriptions]]
== Attaching Subscriptions

You *must* have valid subscriptions attached before installing the
Ansible Automation Platform. Attaching an Ansible Automation Platform
subscription enables Automation Hub repositories. A valid subscription
needs to be attached to the Automation Hub node only. Other nodes do
not need to have a valid subscription/pool attached, even if the
*[automationhub]* group is blank, given this is done at the `repos_el`
role level and that this role is run on both *[default]* and
*[automationhub]* hosts.

Note

Attaching subscriptions is unnecessary if your Red Hat account enabled
https://access.redhat.com/articles/simple-content-access[Simple Content
Access Mode]. But you still need to register to RHSM or Satellite before
installing the Ansible Automation Platform.

To find out the `pool_id` of your Ansible Automation Platform
subscription:

....
#subscription-manager list --available --all | grep "Ansible Automation Platform" -B 3 -A 6
....

The command returns the following:

....
Subscription Name: Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform, Premium (5000 Managed Nodes)
Provides: Red Hat Ansible Engine
Red Hat Single Sign-On
Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform
SKU: MCT3695
Contract: ********
Pool ID: ********************
Provides Management: No
Available: 4999
Suggested: 1
....

To attach this subscription:

....
#subscription-manager attach --pool=<pool_id>
....

If this is properly done, and all nodes have Red Hat Ansible Automation
Platform attached, then it will find the Automation Hub repositories
correctly.

To check whether the subscription was successfully attached:

....
#subscription-manager list --consumed
....

To remove this subscription:

....
#subscription-manager remove --pool=<pool_id>
....
