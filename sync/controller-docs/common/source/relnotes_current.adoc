*Introduced*

* Graphical visualization of the automation topology to show the types
of nodes, the links between them and their statuses

*Added*

* For VM-based installs, the controller will now automatically mount the
system trust store in when jobs run
* *Log Format For API 4XX Errors* field to the Logging settings form to
allow customization of 4xx error messages that are produced when the API
encounters an issue with a request
* Ability to use labels with inventory
* Ability to flag users as superusers and auditors in SAML integration
* Support for expanding and collapsing plays and tasks in the job output
UI
* Filtering job output UI by multiple event types
* Various default search filters to a number of list views
* Top-level list of instances to now be visible in the UI
* A pop-up message when a user copies a resource
* Job Templates tab to Credentials and Inventories to view all the
templates that use that particular credential or inventory

*Updated*

* Controller to use Python 3.9
* Django's `SESSION_COOKIE_NAME` setting to a non-default value. *Note*,
any external clients that previously used the `sessionid` cookie will
need to change. Refer to `api_session_auth` for more detail.
* Controller to support podman-style volume mount syntax in the *Paths
to expose to isolated jobs* field of the Jobs Settings of the UI
* Isolated path to be exposed in OCP/K8s as HostPath
* Upgraded Django from version 2.2 to 3.2
* Modified usage of `ansible_facts` on Advanced Search to add more
flexibility to the usage of `ansible_facts` when creating a smart
inventory
* The controller node for a job running on an execution node now incurs
a penalty of 1 unit of capacity to account for the system load that
controlling a job incurs. This can be adjusted with the file-based
setting `AWX_CONTROL_NODE_TASK_IMPACT`.
* Project updates to always run in the `controlplane` instance group
* Slack notifications to allow replying to a thread instead of just
channels
* UI performance to improve job output
* Job status icons to be more accessible
* Display of only usable inventories when launching a job
* Browser tab to show more information about which page the user is
currently viewing

*Deprecated*

* The concept of "committed capacity" from Instance Groups due to the
removal of RabbitMQ
* Inventory source option to *Update on project update* - this field
updates the inventory source if its project pulled a new revision. In
the future, when updating an inventory source, the controller shall
automatically run project updates if the project itself is set to
*Update on launch*.

*Removed*

* Case sensitivity around hostcount
