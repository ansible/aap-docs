[[deletion_warning]]
Note

If deleting items that are used by other work items, a message opens
listing the items are affected by the deletion and prompts you to
confirm the deletion. Some screens will contain items that are invalid
or previously deleted, so they will fail to run. Below is an example of
such a message:
