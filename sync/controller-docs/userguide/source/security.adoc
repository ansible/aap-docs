== Security

The following sections will help you gain an understanding of how
automation controller handles and lets you control file system security.

All playbooks are executed via the `awx` file system user. For running
jobs, automation controller offers job isolation via the use of Linux
containers. This projection ensures jobs can only access playbooks,
roles, and data from the Project directory for that job template.

For credential security, users may choose to upload locked SSH keys and
set the unlock password to "ask". You can also choose to have the system
prompt them for SSH credentials or sudo passwords rather than having the
system store them in the database.

=== Playbook Access and Information Sharing

Automation controller's use of automation execution environments and
Linux containers prevents playbooks from reading files outside of their
project directory.

By default, the only data exposed to the ansible-playbook process inside
the container is the current project being used.

You can customize this in the Job Settings and expose additional
directories from the host into the container. Refer the next section,
`ug_isolation` for more information.

=== Role-Based Access Controls

Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC) are built into automation controller
and allow administrators to delegate access to server inventories,
organizations, and more. Administrators can also centralize the
management of various credentials, allowing end users to leverage a
needed secret without ever exposing that secret to the end user. RBAC
controls allow the controller to help you increase security and
streamline management.

RBACs are easiest to think of in terms of Roles which define precisely
who or what can see, change, or delete an "object" for which a specific
capability is being set. RBAC is the practice of granting roles to users
or teams.

There are a few main concepts that you should become familiar with
regarding automation controller's RBAC design--roles, resources, and
users. Users can be members of a role, which gives them certain access
to any resources associated with that role, or any resources associated
with "descendant" roles.

A role is essentially a collection of capabilities. Users are granted
access to these capabilities and the controller's resources through the
roles to which they are assigned or through roles inherited through the
role hierarchy.

Roles associate a group of capabilities with a group of users. All
capabilities are derived from membership within a role. Users receive
capabilities only through the roles to which they are assigned or
through roles they inherit through the role hierarchy. All members of a
role have all capabilities granted to that role. Within an organization,
roles are relatively stable, while users and capabilities are both
numerous and may change rapidly. Users can have many roles.

==== Role Hierarchy and Access Inheritance

Imagine that you have an organization named "SomeCompany" and want to
allow two people, "Josie" and "Carter", access to manage all the
settings associated with that organization. You should make both people
members of the organization's `admin_role`.

image:user-role-relationship.png[user-role-relationship]

Often, you will have many Roles in a system and you will want some roles
to include all of the capabilities of other roles. For example, you may
want a System Administrator to have access to everything that an
Organization Administrator has access to, who has everything that a
Project Administrator has access to, and so on.

This concept is referred to as the 'Role Hierarchy':

* Parent roles get all capabilities bestowed on any child roles
* Members of roles automatically get all capabilities for the role they
are a member of, as well as any child roles.

The Role Hierarchy is represented by allowing Roles to have "Parent
Roles". Any capability that a Role has is implicitly granted to any
parent roles (or parents of those parents, and so on).

image:rbac-role-hierarchy.png[rbac-role-hierarchy]

Often, you will have many Roles in a system and you will want some roles
to include all of the capabilities of other roles. For example, you may
want a System Administrator to have access to everything that an
Organization Administrator has access to, who has everything that a
Project Administrator has access to, and so on. We refer to this concept
as the 'Role Hierarchy' and it is represented by allowing Roles to have
"Parent Roles". Any capability that a Role has is implicitly granted to
any parent roles (or parents of those parents, and so on). Of course
Roles can have more than one parent, and capabilities are implicitly
granted to all parents.

image:rbac-heirarchy-morecomplex.png[rbac-heirarchy-morecomplex]

RBAC controls also give you the capability to explicitly permit User and
Teams of Users to run playbooks against certain sets of hosts. Users and
teams are restricted to just the sets of playbooks and hosts to which
they are granted capabilities. And, with automation controller, you can
create or import as many Users and Teams as you require--create users
and teams manually or import them from LDAP or Active Directory.

RBACs are easiest to think of in terms of who or what can see, change,
or delete an "object" for which a specific capability is being
determined.

==== Applying RBAC

The following sections cover how to apply automation controller's RBAC
system in your environment.

===== Editing Users

When editing a user, a automation controller system administrator may
specify the user as being either a _System Administrator_ (also referred
to as the Superuser) or a _System Auditor_.

* System administrators implicitly inherit all capabilities for all
objects (read/write/execute) within the automation controller
environment.
* System Auditors implicitly inherit the read-only capability for all
objects within the automation controller environment.

===== Editing Organizations

When editing an organization, system administrators may specify the
following roles:

* One or more users as organization administrators
* One or more users as organization auditors
* And one or more users (or teams) as organization members

Users/teams that are members of an organization can view their
organization administrator.

Users who are organization administrators implicitly inherit all
capabilities for all objects within that automation controller
organization.

Users who are organization auditors implicitly inherit the read-only
capability for all objects within that automation controller
organization.

===== Editing Projects in an Organization

When editing a project in an organization for which they are the
administrator, system administrators and organization administrators may
specify:

* One or more users/teams that are project administrators
* One or more users/teams that are project members
* And one or more users/teams that may update the project from SCM, from
among the users/teams that are members of that organization.

Users who are members of a project can view their project
administrators.

Project administrators implicitly inherit the capability to update the
project from SCM.

Administrators can also specify one or more users/teams (from those that
are members of that project) that can use that project in a job
template.

===== Creating Inventories and Credentials within an Organization

All access that is granted to use, read, or write credentials is now
handled through roles. You no longer set the “team” or “user” for a
credential. Instead, you use automation controller's RBAC system to
grant ownership, auditor, or usage roles.

System administrators and organization administrators may create
inventories and credentials within organizations under their
administrative capabilities.

Whether editing an inventory or a credential, System administrators and
organization administrators may specify one or more users/teams (from
those that are members of that organization) to be granted the usage
capability for that inventory or credential.

System administrators and organization administrators may specify one or
more users/teams (from those that are members of that organization) that
have the capabilities to update (dynamic or manually) an inventory.
Administrators can also execute ad hoc commands for an inventory.

===== Editing Job Templates

System administrators, organization administrators, and project
administrators, within a project under their administrative
capabilities, may create and modify new job templates for that project.

When editing a job template, administrators (automation controller,
organization, and project) can select among the inventory and
credentials in the organization for which they have usage capabilities
or they may leave those fields blank so that they will be selected at
runtime.

Additionally, they may specify one or more users/teams (from those that
are members of that project) that have execution capabilities for that
job template. The execution capability is valid regardless of any
explicit capabilities the user/team may have been granted against the
inventory or credential specified in the job template.

===== User View

A user can:

* See any organization or project for which they are a member
* Create their own credential objects which only belong to them
* See and execute any job template for which they have been granted
execution capabilities

If a job template a user has been granted execution capabilities on does
not specify an inventory or credential, the user will be prompted at
run-time to select among the inventory and credentials in the
organization they own or have been granted usage capabilities.

Users that are job template administrators can make changes to job
templates; however, to change to the inventory, project, playbook, or
credentials used in the job template, the user must also have the "Use"
role for the project and inventory currently being used or being set.

[[rbac-ug-roles]]
==== Roles

As stated earlier in this documentation, all access that is granted to
use, read, or write credentials is now handled through roles, and roles
are defined for a resource.

===== Built-in roles

The following table lists the RBAC system roles and a brief description
of the how that role is defined with regard to privileges in automation
controller.

|=======================================================================

A Singleton Role is a special role that grants system-wide permissions.
automation controller currently provides two built-in Singleton Roles
but the ability to create or customize a Singleton Role is not supported
at this time.

===== Common Team Roles - "Personas"

Automation controller support personnel typically works on ensuring that
the controller is available and manages it a way to balance
supportability and ease-of-use for users. Often, automation controller
support will assign “Organization Owner/Admin” to users in order to
allow them to create a new Organization and add members from their team
the respective access needed. This minimizes supporting individuals and
focuses more on maintaining uptime of the service and assisting users
who are using automation controller.

Below are some common roles managed by the automation controller
Organization:

=== Function of roles: editing and creating

A new organization “resource roles” functionality was introduced in
automation controller 3.3 that are specific to a certain resource type -
such as workflows. Being a member of such a role usually provides two
types of permissions, in the case of workflows, where a user is given a
"workflow admin role" for the organization "Default":

* this user can create new workflows in the organization "Default"
* user can edit all workflows in the "Default" organization

One exception is job templates, where having the role is irrelevant of
creation permission (more details on its own section).

==== Independence of resource roles and organization membership roles

Resource-specific organization roles are independent of the organization
roles of admin and member. Having the "workflow admin role" for the
"Default" organization will not allow a user to view all users in the
organization, but having a "member" role in the "Default" organization
will. The two types of roles are delegated independently of each other.

===== Necessary permissions to edit job templates

Users can edit fields not impacting job runs (non-sensitive fields) with
a Job Template admin role alone. However, to edit fields that impact job
runs in a job template, a user needs the following:

* *admin* role to the job template
* *use* role to related project
* *use* role to related inventory

An "organization job template admin" role was introduced, but having
this role isn't sufficient by itself to edit a job template within the
organization if the user does not have use role to the project /
inventory a job template uses.

In order to delegate _full_ job template control (within an
organization) to a user or team, you will need grant the team or user
all 3 organization-level roles:

* job template admin
* project admin
* inventory admin

This will ensure that the user (or all users who are members of the team
with these roles) have full access to modify job templates in the
organization. If a job template uses an inventory or project from
another organization, the user with these organization roles may still
not have permission to modify that job template. For clarity of managing
permissions, it is best-practice to not mix projects / inventories from
different organizations.

===== RBAC permissions

Each role should have a content object, for instance, the org admin role
has a content object of the org. To delegate a role, you need admin
permission to the content object, with some exceptions that would result
in you being able to reset a user's password.

*Parent* is the organization.

*Allow* is what this new permission will explicitly allow.

*Scope* is the parent resource that this new role will be created on.
Example: `Organization.project_create_role`.

An assumption is being made that the creator of the resource should be
given the admin role for that resource. If there are any instances where
resource creation does not also imply resource administration, they will
be explicitly called out.

Here are the rules associated with each admin type:

*Project Admin*

* Allow: Create, read, update, delete any project
* Scope: Organization
* User Interface: _Project Add Screen - Organizations_

*Inventory Admin*

* Parent: Org admin
* Allow: Create, read, update, delete any inventory
* Scope: Organization
* User Interface: _Inventory Add Screen - Organizations_

Note

As it is with the *Use* role, if you give a user Project Admin and
Inventory Admin, it allows them to create Job Templates (not workflows)
for your organization.

*Credential Admin*

* Parent: Org admin
* Allow: Create, read, update, delete shared credentials
* Scope: Organization
* User Interface: _Credential Add Screen - Organizations_

*Notification Admin*

* Parent: Org admin
* Allow: Assignment of notifications
* Scope: Organization

*Workflow Admin*

* Parent: Org admin
* Allow: Create a workflow
* Scope: Organization

*Org Execute*

* Parent: Org admin
* Allow: Executing JTs and WFJTs
* Scope: Organization

The following is a sample scenario showing an organization with its
roles and which resource(s) each have access to:
