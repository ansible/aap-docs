[[ug_credentials]]
== Credentials

Credentials are utilized for authentication when launching Jobs against
machines, synchronizing with inventory sources, and importing project
content from a version control system.

You can grant users and teams the ability to use these credentials,
without actually exposing the credential to the user. If you have a user
move to a different team or leave the organization, you donâ€™t have to
re-key all of your systems just because that credential was available in
the automation controller.

Note

The automation controller encrypts passwords and key information in the
database and never makes secret information visible via the API. See
`Automation Controller Administration Guide <administration:ag_secret_handling>`
for details.

[[how_credentials_work]]
=== Understanding How Credentials Work

The automation controller uses SSH to connect to remote hosts (or the
Windows equivalent). In order to pass the key from the automation
controller to SSH, the key must be decrypted before it can be written a
named pipe. The automation controller then uses that pipe to send the
key to SSH (so that it is never written to disk).

If passwords are used, the automation controller handles those by
responding directly to the password prompt and decrypting the password
before writing it to the prompt.

=== Getting Started with Credentials

Click *Credentials* from the left navigation bar to access the
Credentials page. The Credentials page displays a search-able list of
all available Credentials and can be sorted by *Name*.

image:credentials-demo-edit-details.png[Credentials
- home with example credentials]

Credentials added to a Team are made available to all members of the
Team, whereas credentials added to a User are only available to that
specific User by default.

include::work_items_deletion_warning.adoc[]

To help you get started, a Demo Credential has been created for your
use.

Clicking on the link for the *Demo Credential* takes you to the
*Details* view of this Credential.

image:credentials-home-with-demo-credential-details.png[Credentials
- home with demo credential details]

Clicking the *Access* tab shows you users and teams associated with this
Credential and their granted roles (owner, admin, auditor, etc.)

image:credentials-home-with-permissions-detail.png[Credentials
- home with permissions credential details]

Note

A credential with roles associated will retain them even after the
credential has been reassigned to another organization.

You can click the *Add* button to assign this *Demo Credential* to
additional users. If no users exist, add them from the *Users* menu and
refer to the {ug_users} section for further detail.

[[ug_credentials_add]]
=== Add a New Credential

To create a new credential:

[arabic]
. Click the *Add* button from the *Credentials* screen.

image:credentials-create-credential.png[Create
credential]

[arabic, start=2]
. Enter the name for your new credential in the *Name* field.
. Optionally enter a description and enter or select the name of the
organization with which the credential is associated.

Note

A credential with a set of permissions associated with one organization
will remain even after the credential is reassigned to another
organization.

[arabic, start=4]
. Enter or select the credential type you want to create.

image:credential-types-drop-down-menu.png[image]

[arabic, start=5]
. Enter the appropriate details depending on the type of credential
selected, as described in the next section, xref:ug_credentials_cred_types[].
. Click *Save* when done.

[[ug_credentials_cred_types]]
=== Credential Types

The following credential types are supported with the automation
controller:

The credential types associated with Centrify, CyberArk, HashiCorp
Vault, Microsoft Azure Key Management System (KMS), and Thycotic are
part of the credential plugins capability that allows an external system
to lookup your secrets information. See the xref:ug_credential_plugins[]
section for further detail.

[[ug_credentials_aws]]
==== Amazon Web Services

Selecting this credential type enables synchronization of cloud
inventory with Amazon Web Services.

The automation controller uses the following environment variables for
AWS credentials and are fields prompted in the user interface:

....
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN
....

image:credentials-create-aws-credential.png[Credentials
- create AWS credential]

Traditional Amazon Web Services credentials consist of the AWS *Access
Key* and *Secret Key*.

The automation controller provides support for EC2 STS tokens (sometimes
referred to as IAM STS credentials). Security Token Service (STS) is a
web service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege
credentials for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. To learn
more about the IAM/EC2 STS Token, refer to:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html

Note

If the value of your tags in EC2 contain booleans (yes/no/true/false),
you must remember to quote them.

Warning

To use implicit IAM role credentials, do not attach AWS cloud
credentials in the automation controller when relying on IAM roles to
access the AWS API. While it may seem to make sense to attach your AWS
cloud credential to your job template, doing so will force the use of
your AWS credentials and will not "fall through" to use your IAM role
credentials (this is due to the use of the boto library.)

==== Ansible Galaxy/Automation Hub API Token

Selecting this credential allows the automation controller to access
Galaxy or use a collection published on a local Automation Hub. See
xref:ug_collections_usage[] for detail. Entering the Galaxy server URL is the
only required value on this screen.

==== Centrify Vault Credential Provider Lookup

This is considered part of the secret management capability. See
xref:ug_credentials_centrify[] for more detail.

==== Container Registry

Selecting this credential allows the automation controller to access a
collection of container images. See
https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/what-is-a-container-registry[What
is a container registry?] for more information.

Aside from specifying a name, the *Authentication URL* is the only
required field on this screen, and it is already pre-populated with a
default value. You may change this default by specifying the
authentication endpoint for a different container registry.

image:credentials-create-container-credential.png[Credentials

==== CyberArk AIM Credential Provider Lookup

This is considered part of the secret management capability. See
xref:ug_credentials_cyberarkaim[] for more detail.

==== CyberArk Conjur Secret Lookup

This is considered part of the secret management capability. See
xref:ug_credentials_cyberarkconjur[] for more detail.

[[ug_credentials_github]]
==== GitHub Personal Access Token

Selecting this credential allows you to access GitHub using a Personal
Access Token (PAT), which is obtained through GitHub. See {ug_webhooks}
for detail. Entering the provided token is the only required value in
this screen.

image:credentials-create-webhook-github-credential.png[Credentials
- create GitHub credential]

GitHub PAT credentials require a value in the *Token* field, which is
provided in your GitHub profile settings.

This credential can be used for establishing an API connection to GitHub
for use in webhook listener jobs, to post status updates.

[[ug_credentials_gitlab]]
==== GitLab Personal Access Token

Selecting this credential allows you to access GitLab using a Personal
Access Token (PAT), which is obtained through GitLab. See {ug_webhooks}
for detail. Entering the provided token is the only required value in
this screen.

image:credentials-create-webhook-gitlab-credential.png[Credentials
- create GitLab credential]

GitLab PAT credentials require a value in the *Token* field, which is
provided in your GitLab profile settings.

This credential can be used for establishing an API connection to GitLab
for use in webhook listener jobs, to post status updates.

==== Google Compute Engine

Selecting this credential type enables synchronization of cloud
inventory with Google Compute Engine (GCE).

The automation controller uses the following environment variables for
GCE credentials and are fields prompted in the user interface:

....
GCE_EMAIL
GCE_PROJECT
GCE_CREDENTIALS_FILE_PATH
....

image:credentials-create-gce-credential.png[Credentials
- create GCE credential]

GCE credentials have the following inputs that are required:

* *Service Account Email Address*: The email address assigned to the
Google Compute Engine *service account*.
* *Project*: Optionally provide the GCE assigned identification or the
unique project ID you provided at project creation time.
* *Service Account JSON File*: Optionally upload a GCE service account
file. Use the folder
(image:file-browser-button.png[file-browser])
icon to browse for the file that contains the special account
information that can be used by services and applications running on
your GCE instance to interact with other Google Cloud Platform APIs.
This grants permissions to the service account and virtual machine
instances.
* *RSA Private Key*: The PEM file associated with the service account
email.

==== HashiCorp Vault Secret Lookup

This is considered part of the secret management capability. See
xref:ug_credentials_hashivault[] for more detail.

==== HashiCorp Vault Signed SSH

This is considered part of the secret management capability. See
xref:ug_credentials_hashivaultssh[] for more detail.

==== Insights

Selecting this credential type enables synchronization of cloud
inventory with Red Hat Insights.

image:credentials-create-insights-credential.png[Credentials
- create Insights credential]

Insights credentials consist of the Insights *Username* and *Password*,
which is the userâ€™s Red Hat Customer Portal Account username and
password.

==== Machine

Machine credentials enable the automation controller to invoke Ansible
on hosts under your management. Just like using Ansible on the command
line, you can specify the SSH username, optionally provide a password,
an SSH key, a key password, or even have the automation controller
prompt the user for their password at deployment time. They define ssh
and user-level privilege escalation access for playbooks, and are used
when submitting jobs to run playbooks on a remote host. Network
connections (`httpapi`, `netconf`, and `network_cli`) use *Machine* for
the credential type.

Machine/SSH credentials do not use environment variables. Instead, they
pass the username via the `ansible -u` flag, and interactively write the
SSH password when the underlying SSH client prompts for it.

image:credentials-create-machine-credential.png[Credentials
- create machine credential]

Machine credentials have several attributes that may be configured:

* *Username*: The username to be used for SSH authentication.
* *Password*: The actual password to be used for SSH authentication.
This password will be stored encrypted in the database, if entered.
Alternatively, you can configure the automation controller to ask the
user for the password at launch time by selecting *Prompt on launch*. In
these cases, a dialog opens when the job is launched, promoting the user
to enter the password and password confirmation.
* *SSH Private Key*: Copy or drag-and-drop the SSH private key for the
machine credential.
* *Private Key Passphrase*: If the SSH Private Key used is protected by
a password, you can configure a Key Password for the private key. This
password will be stored encrypted in the database, if entered.
Alternatively, you can configure the automation controller to ask the
user for the password at launch time by selecting *Prompt on launch*. In
these cases, a dialog opens when the job is launched, prompting the user
to enter the password and password confirmation.
* *Privilege Escalation Method*: Specifies the type of escalation
privilege to assign to specific users. This is equivalent to specifying
the `--become-method=BECOME_METHOD` parameter, where `BECOME_METHOD`
could be any of the typical methods described below, or a custom method
you've written. Begin entering the name of the method, and the
appropriate name auto-populates.

image:credentials-create-machine-credential-priv-escalation.png[image]

* empty selection: If a task/play has `become` set to `yes` and is used
with an empty selection, then it will default to `sudo`
* *sudo*: Performs single commands with super user (root user)
privileges
* *su*: Switches to the super user (root user) account (or to other user
accounts)
* *pbrun*: Requests that an application or command be run in a
controlled account and provides for advanced root privilege delegation
and keylogging
* *pfexec*: Executes commands with predefined process attributes, such
as specific user or group IDs
* *dzdo*: An enhanced version of sudo that uses RBAC information in an
Centrify's Active Directory service (see Centrify's
http://community.centrify.com/t5/Centrify-Server-Suite/FAQ-What-is-DirectAuthorize-dzdo-dzwin/td-p/21193[site
on DZDO])
* *pmrun*: Requests that an application is run in a controlled account
(refer to
http://documents.software.dell.com/privilege-manager-for-unix/6.0/administrators-guide/privilege-manager-programs/pmrun[Privilege
Manager for Unix 6.0])
* *runas*: Allows you to run as the current user
* *enable*: Switches to elevated permissions on a network device
* *doas*: Allows your remote/login user to execute commands as another
user via the doas ("Do as user") utility
* *ksu*: Allows your remote/login user to execute commands as another
user via Kerberos access
* *machinectl*: Allows you to manage containers via the systemd machine
manager
* *sesu*: Allows your remote/login user to execute commands as another
user via the CA Privileged Access Manager

Note

Custom `become` plugins are available only starting with Ansible 2.8.
For more detail on this concept, refer to [.title-ref]#Und.adoc[]anding
Privilege Escalation
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/become.html# and the
[.title-ref]#list of become plugins
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/become.html#plugin-list#.

* *Privilege Escalation Username* field is only seen if an option for
privilege escalation is selected. Enter the username to use with
escalation privileges on the remote system.
* *Privilege Escalation Password*: field is only seen if an option for
privilege escalation is selected. Enter the actual password to be used
to authenticate the user via the selected privilege escalation type on
the remote system. This password will be stored encrypted in the
database, if entered. Alternatively, you may configure the automation
controller to ask the user for the password at launch time by selecting
*Prompt on launch*. In these cases, a dialog opens when the job is
launched, promoting the user to enter the password and password
confirmation.

Note

Sudo Password must be used in combination with SSH passwords or SSH
Private Keys, since the automation controller must f.adoc[] establish an
authenticated SSH connection with the host prior to invoking sudo to
change to the sudo user.

Warning

Credentials which are used in _Scheduled Jobs_ must not be configured as
"*Prompt on launch*".

==== Microsoft Azure Key Vault

This is considered part of the secret management capability. See
xref:ug_credentials_azurekeyvault[] for more detail.
