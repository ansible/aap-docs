== Setting up Insights Remediations

Automation controller supports integration with Red Hat Insights. Once a
host is registered with Insights, it will be continually scanned for
vulnerabilities and known configuration conflicts. Each of the found
problems may have an associated fix in the form of an Ansible playbook.
Insights users create a maintenance plan to group the fixes and,
ultimately, create a playbook to mitigate the problems. Automation
controller tracks the maintenance plan playbooks via an Insights
project. Authentication to Insights via Basic Auth is backed by a
special Insights Credential, which must first be established in
automation controller. To ultimately run an Insights Maintenance Plan,
you need an Insights project, and an Insights inventory.

. Click *Save* when done.

All SCM/Project syncs occur automatically the first time you save a new
project. However, if you want them to be updated to what is current in
Insights, manually update the SCM-based project by clicking the
image:update-button.png[update] button under
the project's available Actions.

This process syncs your Insights project with your Insights account
solution. Notice that the status dot beside the name of the project
updates once the sync has run.

=== Create Insights Inventory

The Insights playbook contains a [.title-ref]#hosts:# line where the
value is the hostname that Insights itself knows about, which may be
different than the hostname that Tower knows about. To use an Insights
playbook, you will need an Insights inventory.

To create a new inventory for use with Insights, see
`ug_source_insights`.

=== Remediate Insights Inventory

Remediation of an Insights inventory allows Tower to run Insights
playbooks with a single click. This is done by creating a Job Template
to run the Insights remediation.

[arabic]

Templates page.
. Create a new Job Template, with the appropriate details into the
required fields, at minimum. Note the following fields requiring

menu list.
* *Inventory*: Select the Insights Inventory you previously created.
* *Project*: Select the Insights project you previously created.

want to run from the drop-down menu list.
* *Credential*: Enter the credential to use for this project or click
the image:search-button.png[search] button
and select it from the pop-up window. The credential does not have to be

from the drop-down menu list.
