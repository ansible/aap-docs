== Secret Management System

Users and admins upload machine and cloud credentials so that automation
can access machines and external services on their behalf. By default,
sensitive credential values (such as SSH passwords, SSH private keys,
API tokens for cloud services) are stored in the database after being
encrypted. With external credentials backed by credential plugins, you
can map credential fields (like a password or an SSH Private key) to
values stored in a `secret management system` instead of providing them
to the controller directly. automation controller provides a secret
management system that include integrations for:

* Centrify Vault Credential Provider Lookup
* CyberArk Application Identity Manager (AIM)
* CyberArk Conjur
* HashiCorp Vault Key-Value Store (KV)
* HashiCorp Vault SSH Secrets Engine
* Microsoft Azure Key Management System (KMS)
* Thycotic DevOps Secrets Vault
* Thycotic Secret Server

These external secret values will be fetched prior to running a playbook
that needs them. For more information on specifying these credentials in
the User Interface, see `ug_credentials`.

=== Configure and link secret lookups

When configuring automation controller to pull a secret from a 3rd-party
system, it is in essence linking credential fields to external systems.
To link a credential field to a value stored in an external system,
select the external credential corresponding to that system and provide
`metadata` to look up the desired value. The metadata input fields are
part of the `external credential type` definition of the
`source credential`.

Automation controller provides a `credential plugin` interface for
developers, integrators, admins, and power-users with the ability to add
new external credential types to extend it to support other secret
management systems. For more detail, see the
https://github.com/ansible/awx/blob/devel/docs/credentials/credential_plugins.md[development
docs for credential plugins].

Use the automation controller User Interface to configure and use each
of the supported 3-party secret management systems.

. First, create an external credential for authenticating with the
secret management system. At minimum, provide a name for the external
credential and select one of the following for the *Credential Type*:

[arabic, start=2]
. Navigate to the credential form of the target credential and link one
or more input fields to the external credential along with metadata for
locating the secret in the external system. In this example, the _Demo
Credential_ is the target credential.

[arabic, start=3]
. For any of the fields below the *Type Details* area that you want to
link to the external credential, click the
image:key-mgmt-button.png[key] button of the
input field. You are prompted to set the input source to use to retrieve
your secret information.

[arabic, start=4]
. Select the credential you want to link to, and click *Next*. This
takes you to the *Metadata* tab of the input source. This example shows
the Metadata prompt for HashiVault Secret Lookup. Metadata is specific
to the input source you select. See the _Metadata for credential input
sources_ table for details.

[arabic, start=5]
. Click *Test* to verify connection to the secret management system. If
the lookup is unsuccessful, an error message like this one displays:

image:credentials-link-metadata-test-error.png[image]

[arabic, start=6]
. When done, click *OK*. This closes the prompt window and returns you
to the Details screen of your target credential. *Repeat these steps*,
starting with `step 3 above <ag_credential_plugins_link_step>` to
complete the remaining input fields for the target credential. By
linking the information in this manner, automation controller retrieves
sensitive information, such as username, password, keys, certificates,
and tokens from the 3rd-party management systems and populates that data
into the remaining fields of the target credential form.
. If necessary, supply any information manually for those fields that do
not use linking as a way of retrieving sensitive information. Refer to
the appropriate `ug_credentials_cred_types` for more detail about each
of the fields.
. Click *Save* when done.
