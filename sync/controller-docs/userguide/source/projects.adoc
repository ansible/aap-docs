[[ug_projects]]
== Projects

A `Project` is a logical collection of Ansible playbooks.

You can manage playbooks and playbook directories by either placing them
manually under the Project Base Path on your server, or by placing your
playbooks into a source code management (SCM) system supported by
automation controller, including Git, Subversion, and Red Hat Insights.
To create a Red Hat Insights project, refer to `insights`.

Note

By default, the Project Base Path is `/var/lib/awx/projects`, but this
may have been modified by the administrator. It is configured in
`/etc/tower/conf.d/custom.py`. Use caution when editing this file, as
incorrect settings can disable your installation.

The Projects page displays the list of the projects that are currently
available. The default view is collapsed (*Compact*) with project name
and its status, but you can use the arrow next to each entry to expand
for more information.

image:projects-list-all.png[Projects - home
with example project]

image:projects-list-all-expanded.png[image]

For each project listed, you can get the latest SCM revision
(image:refresh-gray.png[refresh]), edit the
project (image:edit-button.png[edit]), or
copy the project attributes
(image:copy-button.png[copy]), using the
respective icons next to each project. Projects are allowed to be
updated while a related job is running. In cases where you have a big
project (around 10 GB), disk space on `/tmp` may be an issue.

*Status* indicates the state of the project and may be one of the
following (note that you can also filter your view by specific status
types):

* *Pending* - The source control update has been created, but not queued
or started yet. Any job (not just source control updates) will stay in
pending until it's actually ready to be run by the system. Reasons for
it not being ready because it has dependencies that are currently
running so it has to wait until they are done, or there is not enough
capacity to run in the locations it is configured to.
* *Waiting* - The source control update is in the queue waiting to be
executed.
* *Running* - The source control update is currently in progress.
* *Successful* - The last source control update for this project
succeeded.
* *Failed* - The last source control update for this project failed.
* *Error* - The last source control update job failed to run at all. (To
be deprecated.)
* *Canceled* - The last source control update for the project was
canceled.
* *Never updated* - The project is configured for source control, but
has never been updated.
* *OK* - The project is not configured for source control, and is
correctly in place. (To be deprecated.)
* *Missing* - Projects are absent from the project base path of
`/var/lib/awx/projects` (applicable for manual or source control managed
projects).

Note

Projects of credential type Manual cannot update or schedule source
control-based actions without being reconfigured as an SCM type
credential.

=== Add a new project

To create a new project:

[arabic]
. Click the *Add* button, which launches the *Create Project* window.

image:projects-create-new-project.png[Projects
- create new project]

[arabic, start=2]
. Enter the appropriate details into the following required fields:

* *Name*
* *Description* (optional)
* *Organization* - A project must have at least one organization. Pick
one organization now to create the project, and then after the project
is created you can add additional organizations.
* *Default Execution Environment* (optional) - Enter the name of the
execution environment or search from a list of existing ones to run this
project. See `upgrade_venv` in the Ansible Automation Platform Upgrade
and Migration Guide for more information.
* *Source Control Credential Type* - Select from the drop-down menu list
an SCM type associated with this project. The options in the subsequent
section become available depend on the type you choose. Refer to
xref:ug_manual` or {ug_projects_scm_types} in the subsequent sections for
more detail.

Note

If adding a manual project, each project path inside of the project root
folder can only be assigned to one project. If you receive the following
message, ensure that you have not already assigned the project path to
an existing project:

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
`All of the project paths have been assigned to existing projects, or there are no directories found in the base path.`
`You will need to add a project path before creating a new project.`
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

[arabic, start=3]
. Click *Save* when done.

[[ug_manual]]
==== Manage playbooks manually

* Create one or more directories to store playbooks under the Project
Base Path (for example, /var/lib/awx/projects/)
* Create or copy playbook files into the playbook directory.
* Ensure that the playbook directory and files are owned by the same
UNIX user and group that the automation controller service runs as.
* Ensure that the permissions are appropriate for the playbook
directories and files.

If you have trouble adding a project path, check the permissions and
SELinux context settings for the project directory and files.

Warning

If you have not added any Ansible playbook directories to the base
project path, you will receive the following message:

Correct this issue by creating the appropriate playbook directories and
checking out playbooks from your SCM or otherwise copying playbooks into
the appropriate playbook directories.

[[ug_projects_scm_types]]
==== Manage playbooks using source control

===== SCM Types - Git and Subversion

To configure playbooks to use source control, in the Project *Details*
tab:

[arabic]
. Select the appropriate option (Git or Subversion) from the *SCM Type*
drop-down menu list.

[arabic, start=2]
. Enter the appropriate details into the following fields:

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
* *SCM URL* - See an example in the tooltip .

* *SCM Branch/Tag/Commit* - Optionally enter the SCM branch, tags,
commit hashes, arbitrary refs, or revision number (if applicable) from
the source control (Git or Subversion) to checkout. Some commit hashes
and refs may not be available unless you also provide a custom refspec
in the next field. If left blank, the default is HEAD which is the last
checked out Branch/Tag/Commit for this project.
* *SCM Refspec* - This field is an option specific to git source control
and only advanced users familiar and comfortable with git should specify
which references to download from the remote repository. For more
detail, see `job branch overriding <ug_job_branching>`.
* *SCM Credential* - If authentication is required, select the
appropriate SCM credential
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

[arabic, start=3]
. In the *SCM Update Options*, optionally select the launch behavior, if
applicable.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
--
* *Clean* - Removes any local modifications prior to performing an
update.
* *Delete on Update* - Deletes the local repository in its entirety
prior to performing an update. Depending on the size of the repository
this may significantly increase the amount of time required to complete
an update.
* *Update Revision on Launch* - Updates the revision of the project to
the current revision in the remote source control, as well as cache the
roles directory from `Galaxy <ug_galaxy>` or
`Collections <ug_collections>`. Automation controller ensures that the
local revision matches and that the roles and collections are up-to-date
with the last update. Also, to avoid job overflows if jobs are spawned
faster than the project can sync, selecting this allows you to configure
a Cache Timeout to cache prior project syncs for a certain number of
seconds.
* *Allow Branch Override* - Allows a job template that uses this project
to launch with a specified SCM branch or revision other than that of the
project's. For more detail, see
`job branch overriding <ug_job_branching>`.

Tip

Using a GitHub link offers an easy way to use a playbook. To help get
you started, use the `helloworld.yml` file available at:
https://github.com/ansible/tower-example.git

This link offers a very similar playbook to the one created manually in
the instructions found in the
`Automation Controller Quick Setup Guide <qs_start>`. Using it will not
alter or harm your system in anyway.

===== SCM Type - Red Hat Insights

To configure playbooks to use Red Hat Insights, in the Project *Details*
tab:

[arabic]
. Select *Red Hat Insights* from the *SCM Type* drop-down menu list.
. Red Hat Insights requires a credential for authentication. Select from
the *Credential* field the appropriate credential for use with Insights.
. In the *SCM Update Options*, optionally select the launch behavior, if
applicable.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
* *Clean* - Removes any local modifications prior to performing an
update.
* *Delete on Update* - Deletes the local repository in its entirety
prior to performing an update. Depending on the size of the repository
this may significantly increase the amount of time required to complete
an update.
* *Update Revision on Launch* - Updates the revision of the project to
the current revision in the remote source control, as well as cache the
roles directory from `Galaxy <ug_galaxy>` or
`Collections <ug_collections>`. Automation controller ensures that the
local revision matches and that the roles and collections are up-to-date
with the last update. Also, to avoid job overflows if jobs are spawned

. Click *Save* to save your project.

===== SCM Type - Remote Archive

Playbooks using a remote archive allow projects to be provided based on
a build process that produces a versioned artifact, or release,
containing all the requirements for that project in a single archive.

To configure playbooks to use a remote archive, in the Project *Details*
tab:

[arabic]
. Select *Remote Archive* from the *SCM Type* drop-down menu list.
. Enter the appropriate details into the following fields:

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
* *SCM URL* - requires a URL to a remote archive, such as a _GitHub
Release_ or a build artifact stored in _Artifactory_ and unpacks it into
the project path for use
* *SCM Credential* - If authentication is required, select the
appropriate SCM credential
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

[arabic, start=3]
. In the *SCM Update Options*, optionally select the launch behavior, if
applicable.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
* *Clean* - Removes any local modifications prior to performing an
update.
* *Delete on Update* - Deletes the local repository in its entirety
prior to performing an update. Depending on the size of the repository
this may significantly increase the amount of time required to complete
an update.
* *Update Revision on Launch* - Not recommended, as this option updates
the revision of the project to the current revision in the remote source
control, as well as cache the roles directory from `Galaxy <ug_galaxy>`
or `Collections <ug_collections>`.
* *Allow Branch Override* - Not recommended, as this option allows a job
template that uses this project to launch with a specified SCM branch or
revision other than that of the project's.

Note

Since this SCM type is intended to support the concept of unchanging
artifacts, it is advisable to disable Galaxy integration (for roles, at
minimum).

=== Updating projects from source control

[arabic]
. Update an existing SCM-based project by selecting the project and
clicking the image:refresh-gray.png[refresh]
button.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Note

Please note that immediately after adding a project setup to use source
control, a "Sync" starts that fetches the project details from the
configured source control.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

=== Work with Permissions

The set of permissions assigned to this project (role-based access
controls) that provide the ability to read, modify, and administer
projects, inventories, job templates, and other automation controller
elements are Privileges.

You can access the project permissions via the *Access* tab next to the
*Details* tab. This screen displays a list of users that currently have
permissions to this project. The list may be sorted and searched by
*Username*, *F.adoc[] Name*, or *Last Name*.

schedule preferences.
* If schedules have not been set up, refer to {ug_scheduling} for more
information.

[[ug_galaxy]]
=== Ansible Galaxy Support

At the end of a Project update, automation controller searches for a
file called `requirements.yml` in the `roles` directory, located at
`<project-top-level-directory>/roles/requirements.yml`. If this file is
found, the following command automatically runs:

....
ansible-galaxy role install -r roles/requirements.yml -p <project-specific cache location>/requirements_roles -vvv
....

This file allows you to reference Galaxy roles or roles within other
repositories which can be checked out in conjunction with your own
project. The addition of this Ansible Galaxy support eliminates the need
to create git submodules for achieving this result. Given that SCM
projects (along with roles/collections) are pulled into and executed
from a private job environment, a <private job directory> specific to
the project within `/tmp` is created by default. However, you can
specify another *Job Execution Path* based on your environment in the
Jobs Settings tab of the Settings window:

image:configure-tower-jobs-execution-path.png[image]

The cache directory is a subdirectory inside the global projects folder.
The content may be copied from the cache location to
`<job private directory>/requirements_roles` location.

By default, automation controller has a system-wide setting that allows
roles to be dynamically downloaded from the `roles/requirements.yml`
file for SCM projects. You may turn off this setting in the *Jobs
settings* screen of the Settings menu by switching the *Enable Role
Download* toggle button to *OFF*.

image:configure-tower-jobs-download-roles.png[image]

Whenever a project sync runs, automation controller determines if the
project source and any roles from Galaxy and/or Collections are out of
date with the project. Project updates will download the roles inside
the update.

If jobs need to pick up a change made to an upstream role, updating the
project will ensure this happens. A change to the role means that a new
commit was pushed to the _provision-role_ source control. To make this
change take effect in a job, you do not need to push a new commit to the
_playbooks_ repo, but you *do need* to update the project, which
downloads roles to a local cache. For instance, say you have two git
repositories in source control. The f.adoc[] one is _playbooks_ and the
project in automation controller points to this URL. The second one is
_provision-role_ and it is referenced by the `roles/requirements.yml`
file inside of the _playbooks_ git repo.

In short, jobs would download the most recent roles before every job
run. Roles and collections are locally cached for performance reasons,
and you will need to select *Update Revision on Launch* in the project
SCM Update Options to ensure that the upstream role is re-downloaded
before each job run:

image:projects-scm-update-options-update-on-launch-checked.png[update-on-launch]

The update happens much earlier in the process than the sync, so this
surfaces errors and details faster and in a more logic place.

For more information and examples on the syntax of the
`requirements.yml` file, refer to the
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/galaxy/user_guide.html#installing-multiple-roles-from-a-file[role
requirements section] in the Ansible documentation.

If there are any directories that should specifically be exposed, you
can specify those in the Jobs section of the Settings screen in the
*Paths to Expose to Isolated Jobs* or by updating the following entry in
the settings file:

`AWX_ISOLATION_SHOW_PATHS = ['/list/of/', '/paths']

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Note

The primary file you may want to add to `AWX_ISOLATION_SHOW_PATHS` is
`/var/lib/awx/.ssh`, if your playbooks need to use keys or settings
defined there.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

If you made changes in the settings file, be sure to restart services
with the `automation-controller-service restart` command after your
changes have been saved.

In the User Interface, you can configure these settings in the Jobs
settings window.

image:configure-tower-jobs-path-to-expose.png[image]

Note

The *Primary Galaxy Server Username* and *Primary Galaxy Server
Password* fields are no longer configurable in automation controller
3.8. We recommend using tokens to access Galaxy or Automation Hub
instead.

[[ug_collections]]
=== Collections Support

Automation controller supports project-specific
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html[Ansible
collections] in job runs. If you specify a collections requirements file
in the SCM at `collections/requirements.yml`, automation controller will
install collections in that file in the implicit project sync before a
job run.

By default, automation controller has a system-wide setting that allows
collections to be dynamically downloaded from the
`collections/requirements.yml` file for SCM projects. You may turn off
this setting in the *Jobs settings* tab of the Settings menu by
switching the *Enable Collections Download* toggle button to *OFF*.

_____________________________________________________________________________________
image:configure-tower-jobs-download-collections.png[image]
_____________________________________________________________________________________

Roles and collections are locally cached for performance reasons, and
you will need to select *Update Revision on Launch* in the project SCM
Update Options to ensure this:

image:projects-scm-update-options-update-on-launch-checked.png[update-on-launch]

[[ug_collections_usage]]
==== Using Collections via Hub

Before automation controller can use Automation Hub as the default
source for collections content, you need to create an API token in the
Automation Hub UI so that it could be specified in automation
controller. You may connect to a private Automation Hub or a public
Automation Hub collection, the only difference is which URL you specify.

[arabic]
. Navigate to https://cloud.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/token and
click *Load token*.
. Click the copy icon to copy the API token to the clipboard.

image:projects-ah-loaded-token-shown.png[image]

[arabic, start=3]
. To use the public Automation Hub, create an Automation Hub credential
using the copied token and pointing to the URLs shown in the *Server
URL* and *SSO URL* fields of the token page:

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________
* *Galaxy Server URL* = `https://cloud.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/`
* *AUTH SEVER URL* =
`https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token`
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________

[arabic, start=4]
. To use a private Automation Hub, create an Automation Hub credential
using a token retrieved from the Repo Management dashboard of your local
Automation Hub and pointing to the published repo URL as shown:

image:projects-ah-repo-mgmt-get-token.png[image]

image:projects-ah-repo-mgmt-repos-published.png[image]

You can create different repos with different namespaces/collections in
them. But for each repo in Automation Hub you need to create a different
Automation Hub credential. Copy the *Ansible CLI URL* from the
Automation Hub UI in the format of
`https://$<hub_url>/api/galaxy/content/<repo you want to pull from>`
into the *Galaxy Server URL* field of the _Create Credential_ form:

image:projects-create-ah-credential.png[image]

Refer to
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/1.2/html/managing_red_hat_certified_and_ansible_galaxy_collections_in_automation_hub/index[Managing
Red Hat Certified and Ansible Galaxy Collections in Ansible Hub] for
Automation Hub UI-specific instructions.

[arabic, start=5]
. Navigate to the organization for which you want to be able to sync
content from Automation Hub and add the new Automation Hub credential to
the organization. This step allows you to associate each organization
with the Automation Hub credential (i.e. repo) that you want to be able
to use content from.

image:projects-organizations-add-ah-credential.png[image]

Note

Suppose you have two repos:

* _Prod_: `Namespace 1` and `Namespace 2`, each with collection `A` and
`B` so: `namespace1.collectionA:v2.0.0` and
`namespace2.collectionB:v2.0.0`
* _Stage_: `Namespace 1` with only collection `A` so:
`namespace1.collectionA:v1.5.0` on Automation Hub, you will have a repo
URL for _Prod_ and _Stage_.

You can create an Automation Hub credential for each one. Then you can
assign different levels of access to different organizations. For
example, you can create a Developers organization has access to both
repos, while an Operations organization just has access to the
Automation Hub *Prod* repo only.

Refer to
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/1.0/html/managing_user_access_in_automation_hub/index[Managing
User Access in Ansible Hub] for Automation Hub UI-specific instructions.

[arabic, start=6]
. If the Automation Hub has self-signed certificates, click the toggle
to enable the setting *Ignore Ansible Galaxy SSL Certificate
Verification*. For *public Automation Hub*, which uses a signed
certificate, click the toggle to disable it instead. Note this is a
global setting:

image:settings-jobs-ignore-galaxy-certs.png[image]

[arabic, start=7]
. Create a project, where the source repository specifies the necessary
collections in a requirements file located in the
`collections/requirements.yml` file. Refer to the syntax described in
the Ansible documentation:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html#install-multiple-collections-with-a-requirements-file.

image:projects-add-ah-source-repo.png[image]

[arabic, start=8]
. In the Projects list view, click
image:refresh-gray.png[update] to run an
update against this project. Automation controller fetches the Galaxy
collections from the `collections/requirements.yml` file and report it
as changed; and the collections will now be installed for any job
template using this project.

Note

If updates are needed from Galaxy or Collections, a sync is performed
that downloads the required roles, consuming that much more space in
your /tmp file. In cases where you have a big project (around 10 GB),
disk space on `/tmp` may be an issue.

For more information on collections, refer to
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html[Using
Collections]. For more information on how Red Hat itself publishes one
of these official collections, which can be used to automate your
automation controller install directly, refer to the
https://cloud.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/ansible/tower/docs[AWX
Ansible Collection] documentation. This page is accessible with your Red
Hat customer credentials as part of your Red Hat Ansible Automation
Platform subscription.
