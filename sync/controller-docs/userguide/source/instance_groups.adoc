== Instance Groups

An `Instance Group` provides the ability to group instances in a
clustered environment. Additionally, policies dictate how instance
groups behave and how jobs are executed. The following view displays the
capacity levels based on policy algorithms:

Group policy example]

For more information about the policy or rules associated with instance
groups, see the `ag_instance_groups` section of the Automation
Controller Administration Guide.

If you want to connect your instance group to a container, refer to
`ag_container_groups` for further detail.

For an in-depth discussion on these concepts, refer to the _Feature
Spotlight: Instance Groups and Isolated Nodes_

=== Create an instance group

To create a new instance group:

[arabic]
. Click *Instance Groups* from the left navigation menu to open the
Instance Groups configuration window.
. Click the *Add* button and select *Create Instance Group*.

[arabic, start=3]
. Enter the appropriate details into the following fields:

* *Name*. Names must be unique and must not be named _controller_.
* *Policy Instance Minimum*. Enter the minimum number of instances to
automatically assign to this group when new instances come online.
* *Policy Instance Percentage*. Use the slider to select a minimum
percentage of instances to automatically assign to this group when new
instances come online.

Note

Policy Instance fields are not required to create a new instance group.
If you do not specify values, then the Policy Instance Minimum and
Policy Instance Percentage default to 0.

[arabic, start=4]
. Click *Save*.

Once the instance group is successfully created, the *Details* tab of
the newly created instance group remains, which allows you to review and
edit your instance group information. This is the same menu that is
opened if the Edit
(image:edit-button.png[edit-button]) button
is clicked from the *Instance Group* link. You can also edit *Instances*
and review *Jobs* associated with this instance group.

This view also allows you to edit some key attributes associated with

==== View jobs associated with an instance group

To view the jobs associated with the instance group, click the *Jobs*
tab of the Instance Group window and then click *Expanded* to expand the
view to show details about each job.

instances jobs]

Each job displays the job status, ID, and name; type of job, time
started and completed, who started the job; and which template,
inventory, project, and credential were used.

The instances are run in accordance with instance group policies. Refer
to `Instance Group Policies <administration:ag_instance_group_policies>`
in the Automation Controller Administration Guide.
