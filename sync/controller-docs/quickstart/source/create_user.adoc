- default admin user]

A default [.title-ref]#admin# user with the role of System Administrator
has been automatically created and is available to all users of
automation controller. It can be used as is or edited later as needed.
You may add other users to an organization, but you must create the
user(s) first. Refer to the `Users <userguide:ug_users_create>` section
in the Automation Controller User Guide for detail.

For the purpose of this Quick Start Guide, leave the default user as is.
