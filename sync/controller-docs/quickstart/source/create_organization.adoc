== Review the Organization

An organization is a logical collection of users, teams, projects, and
inventories. It is the highest level object in the controller object
hierarchy.

From the left navigation bar, click *Organizations*.

Note

The automation controller creates a default organization automatically.
Users of Tower with a Self-support level license only have the default
organization available and should *not* delete it.

A default organization has been automatically created and is available
to all users of the automation controller. It can be used as is or
edited later as needed.

For the purpose of this Quick Start Guide, leave the default
organization as is.

Note

If you are using the controller with a Basic subscription, you must use
the default organization. Only Enterprise or Premium licenses have the
ability to add new organizations beyond the default.

To edit the default organization later, expand its properties by
clicking the Edit
(image:edit-button.png[edit]) button and
entering the appropriate details, then save your changes.

Enterprise and Premium license users who want to add a new organization
should refer to the `Organizations <userguide:ug_organizations>` section
in the Automation Controller User Guide.
