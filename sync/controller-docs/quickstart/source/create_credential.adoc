== Create a Credential

single: credentials; create

Credentials authenticate the controller user to launch Ansible
playbooks, which can include passwords and SSH keys, against inventory
hosts. You can also require the controller user to enter a password or
key phrase when a playbook launches using the credentials feature of the
controller.

Access the list of credentials by clicking *Credentials* from the left
navigation bar.
