For the purpose of this Quick Start Guide, leave the default demo job
template as is. But to edit the default template later - from the
Details tab, click *Edit*, or from the Templates list view, click the
Edit (image:../../common/source/images/edit-button.png[edit]) button
next to the template name to edit the appropriate details, then save
your changes.

Click *Cancel* (if no changes were made) or use the breadcrumb
navigational links at the top of the browser to return to the Templates
list view. Clicking *Save* does not exit the Details dialog.
