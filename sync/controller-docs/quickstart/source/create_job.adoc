A job template combines an Ansible playbook from a project and the
settings required to launch it. Review existing job templates by
clicking *Templates* from the left navigation bar.

For the purpose of this Quick Start Guide, leave the default demo job
template as is. But to edit the default template later - from the
Details tab, click *Edit*, or from the Templates list view, click the
Edit (image:edit-button.png[edit]) button
next to the template name to edit the appropriate details, then save
your changes.

Click *Cancel* (if no changes were made) or use the breadcrumb
navigational links at the top of the automation controller browser to
return to the Templates list view. Clicking *Save* does not exit the
Details dialog.
