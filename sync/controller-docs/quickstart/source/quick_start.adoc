== Quick Start

Welcome to the Automation Controller Quick Start Guide. At the end of
the Quick Start, you will have a functioning controller application that
you can use to launch more sophisticated playbooks. You can expect the
Quick Start process to take less than thirty minutes.

To begin, you must install Ansible Automation Platform and you must
choose a target system where an initial playbook can be deployed
(provided by automation controller). Refer to
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.1/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_installation_guide/planning-installation[Red
Hat Ansible Automation Platform Installation Guide] for further
instructions.

This first playbook executes simple Ansible tasks, while teaching you
how to use the controller, as well as ensuring its proper setup. This
can be any sort of system manageable by Ansible, as described in the
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/basic_concepts.html#managed-nodes[Managed
nodes] section of the Ansible documentation.

Note

Ansible Automation Platform is offered on a subscription basis. These
subscriptions vary in price and support-levels. For more information
about subscriptions and features, see `subscription-types`.
