== Changing the Default Timeout for Authentication

The default length of time, in seconds, that your supplied token is
valid can be changed in the System Settings screen of the controller
user interface:

[arabic]
. From the Settings
(image:settings.png[settings]) Menu screen,
click *System*.
. Select the *Misc. System* tab, if not already the default view.
. Enter the timeout period in seconds in the *Idle Time Force Log Out*
text field.

[arabic, start=4]
. Click *Save* to apply your changes.

Note

If you are accessing the controller directly and are having trouble
getting your authentication to stay, in that you have to keep logging in
over and over, try clearing your web browser's cache. In situations like
this, it is often found that the authentication token has been cached in
the browser session and must be cleared.
