== Setting up LDAP Authentication

Note

If the LDAP server you want to connect to has a certificate that is
self-signed or signed by a corporate internal certificate authority
(CA), the CA certificate must be added to the system's trusted CAs.
Otherwise, connection to the LDAP server will result in an error that
the certificate issuer is not recognized.

Administrators use LDAP as a source for account authentication
information for the controller users. User authentication is provided,
but not the synchronization of user permissions and credentials.
Organization membership (as well as the organization admin) and team
memberships can be synchronized.

When so configured, a user who logs in with an LDAP username and
password automatically gets a controller account created for them and
they can be automatically placed into organizations as either regular
users or organization administrators.

Users created via an LDAP login cannot change their username, first
name, last name, or set a local password for themselves. This is also
tunable to restrict editing of other field names.

To configure LDAP integration for the controller:

[arabic]
. First, create a user in LDAP that has access to read the entire LDAP
structure.
. Test if you can make successful queries to the LDAP server, use the
`ldapsearch` command, which is a command line tool that can be installed
on the controller system's command line as well as on other Linux and
OSX systems. Use the following command to query the ldap server, where
_josie_ and _Josie4Cloud_ are replaced by attributes that work for your
setup:

....
ldapsearch -x  -H ldap://win -D "CN=josie,CN=Users,DC=website,DC=com" -b "dc=website,dc=com" -w Josie4Cloud
....

Here `CN=josie,CN=users,DC=website,DC=com` is the Distinguished Name of
the connecting user.

Note

The `ldapsearch` utility is not automatically pre-installed with
automation controller, however, you can install it from the
`openldap-clients` package.

[arabic, start=3]
. In the automation controller User Interface, click *Settings* from the
left navigation and click to select *LDAP settings* from the list of
Authentication options.

Note

You can configure multiple LDAP servers by specifying the server to
configure (otherwise, leave the server at *Default*):

image:configure-tower-auth-ldap-servers.png[image]

[verse]
--

--

The equivalent API endpoints will show `AUTH_LDAP_*` repeated:
`AUTH_LDAP_1_*`, `AUTH_LDAP_2_*`, ..., `AUTH_LDAP_5_*` to denote server
designations.

[arabic, start=4]
. Click *Edit* and enter the LDAP server address to connect to in the
*LDAP Server URI* field using the same format as the one shown in the
text field. Below is an example:

image:configure-tower-auth-ldap-server-uri.png[image]

[arabic, start=5]
. Enter the Distinguished Name in the *LDAP Bind DN* text field to
specify the user that the controller uses to connect (Bind) to the LDAP
server. Below uses the example, `CN=josie,CN=users,DC=website,DC=com`:

image:configure-tower-auth-ldap-bind-dn.png[image]

[arabic, start=6]
. Enter the password to use for the Binding user in the *LDAP Bind
Password* text field. In this example, the password is 'passme':

image:configure-tower-auth-ldap-bind-pwd.png[image]

[arabic, start=7]
. If that name is stored in key `sAMAccountName`, the *LDAP User DN
Template* populates with `(sAMAccountName=%(user)s)`. Active Directory
stores the username to `sAMAccountName`. Similarly, for OpenLDAP, the
key is `uid`--hence the line becomes `(uid=%(user)s)`.
. Click to select a group type from the *LDAP Group Type* drop-down menu
list.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
LDAP Group Types include:

* `PosixGroupType`
* `GroupOfNamesType`
* `GroupOfUniqueNamesType`
* `ActiveDirectoryGroupType`
* `OrganizationalRoleGroupType`
* `MemberDNGroupType`
* `NISGroupType`
* `NestedGroupOfNamesType`
* `NestedGroupOfUniqueNamesType`
* `NestedActiveDirectoryGroupType`
* `NestedOrganizationalRoleGroupType`
* `NestedMemberDNGroupType`
* `PosixUIDGroupType`

The LDAP Group Types that are supported by the controller leverage the
underlying link:[django-auth-ldap library].

Each *LDAP Group Type* can potentially take different parameters. The
controller exposes `LDAP_GROUP_TYPE_PARAMS` to account for this.
`LDAP_GROUP_TYPE_PARAMS` is a dictionary, which will be converted by the
controller to kwargs and passed to the LDAP Group Type class selected.
There are two common parameters used by any of the LDAP Group Type;
`name_attr` and `member_attr`. Where `name_attr` defaults to `cn` and
`member_attr` defaults to `member`:

....
{"name_attr": "cn", "member_attr": "member"}
....

To determine what parameters a specific LDAP Group Type expects. refer
to the link:[django_auth_ldap] documentation around the classes `init`
parameters.

[arabic, start=9]
. Enter the group distinguish name to allow users within that group to
access the controller in the *LDAP Require Group* field, using the same
format as the one shown in the text field. In this example, use:
`CN=controller Users,OU=Users,DC=website,DC=com`

image:configure-tower-auth-ldap-req-group.png[image]

[arabic, start=10]
. Enter the group distinguish name to prevent users within that group to
access the controller in the *LDAP Deny Group* field, using the same
format as the one shown in the text field. In this example, leave the
field blank.
. The *LDAP Start TLS* is disabled by default. To enable TLS when the
LDAP connection is not using SSL, click the toggle to *ON*.

image:configure-tower-auth-ldap-start-tls.png[image]

[arabic, start=12]
. Enter where to search for users while authenticating in the *LDAP USER
SEARCH* field using the same format as the one shown in the text field.
In this example, use:

....
[
"OU=Users,DC=website,DC=com",
"SCOPE_SUBTREE",
"(cn=%(user)s)"
]
....

The first line specifies where to search for users in the LDAP tree. In
the above example, the users are searched recursively starting from
`DC=website,DC=com`.

The second line specifies the scope where the users should be searched:

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
* SCOPE_BASE: This value is used to indicate searching only the entry at
the base DN, resulting in only that entry being returned
* SCOPE_ONELEVEL: This value is used to indicate searching all entries
one level under the base DN - but not including the base DN and not
including any entries under that one level under the base DN.
* SCOPE_SUBTREE: This value is used to indicate searching of all entries
at all levels under and including the specified base DN.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The third line specifies the key name where the user name is stored.

image:configure-tower-authen-ldap-user-search.png[image]

Note

For multiple search queries, the proper syntax is: :

....
[
  [
  "OU=Users,DC=northamerica,DC=acme,DC=com",
  "SCOPE_SUBTREE",
  "(sAMAccountName=%(user)s)"
  ],
  [
  "OU=Users,DC=apac,DC=corp,DC=com",
  "SCOPE_SUBTREE",
  "(sAMAccountName=%(user)s)"
  ],
  [
  "OU=Users,DC=emea,DC=corp,DC=com",
  "SCOPE_SUBTREE",
  "(sAMAccountName=%(user)s)"
  ]
]
....

[arabic, start=13]
. In the *LDAP Group Search* text field, specify which groups should be
searched and how to search them. In this example, use:

....
[
....

_____________________________________________________________
"dc=example,dc=com", "SCOPE_SUBTREE", "(objectClass=group)" ]
_____________________________________________________________

* The first line specifies the BASE DN where the groups should be
searched.
* The second lines specifies the scope and is the same as that for the
user directive.
* The third line specifies what the `objectclass` of a group object is
in the LDAP you are using.

image:configure-tower-authen-ldap-group-search.png[image]

[arabic, start=14]
. Enter the user attributes in the *LDAP User Attribute Map* the text
field. In this example, use:

....
{
"first_name": "givenName",
"last_name": "sn",
"email": "mail"
}
....

The above example retrieves users by last name from the key `sn`. You
can use the same LDAP query for the user to figure out what keys they
are stored under.

image:configure-tower-auth-ldap-user-attrb-map.png[image]

[arabic, start=15]
. Enter the user profile flags in the *LDAP User Flags by Group* the
text field. In this example, use the following syntax to set LDAP users
as "Superusers" and "Auditors":

....
{
"is_superuser": "cn=superusers,ou=groups,dc=website,dc=com",
"is_system_auditor": "cn=auditors,ou=groups,dc=website,dc=com"
}
....

The above example retrieves users who are flagged as superusers or as
auditor in their profile.

image:configure-tower-auth-ldap-user-flags.png[image]

[arabic, start=16]
. For details on completing the mapping fields, see
`ag_ldap_org_team_maps`.
. Click *Save* when done.

With these values entered on this form, you can now make a successful
authentication with LDAP.

Note

The controller does not actively sync users, but they are created during
their initial login. To improve performance associated with LDAP
authentication, see `ug_ldap_auth_perf_tips` in the Automation
Controller User Guide.

=== Referrals

Active Directory uses "referrals" in case the queried object is not
available in its database. It has been noted that this does not work
properly with the django LDAP client and, most of the time, it helps to
disable referrals. Disable LDAP referrals by adding the following lines
to your `/etc/tower/conf.d/custom.py` file:

....
AUTH_LDAP_GLOBAL_OPTIONS = {
    ldap.OPT_REFERRALS: False,
}
....

Note

"Referrals" are disabled by default in automation controller version
2.4.3 and above. If you are running an earlier version of the
controller, you should consider adding this parameter to your
configuration file.

For details on completing the mapping fields, see
`ag_ldap_org_team_maps`.

=== Enabling Logging for LDAP

To enable logging for LDAP, you must set the level to `DEBUG` in the
Settings configuration window:

[arabic]
. Click *Settings* from the left navigation pane and click to select
*Logging settings* from the System list of options.
. Click *Edit*.
. Set the *Logging Aggregator Level Threshold* field to *Debug*.

image:settings-system-logging-debug.png[image]

[arabic, start=4]
. Click *Save* to save your changes.

[[ag_ldap_org_team_maps]]
=== LDAP Organization and Team Mapping

Next, you will need to control which users are placed into which
controller organizations based on LDAP attributes (mapping out between
your organization admins/users and LDAP groups).

Keys are organization names. Organizations will be created if not
present. Values are dictionaries defining the options for each
organization's membership. For each organization, it is possible to
specify what groups are automatically users of the organization and also
what groups can administer the organization.

*admins*: None, True/False, string or list/tuple of strings.::
  * If *None*, organization admins will not be updated based on LDAP
  values.
  * If *True*, all users in LDAP will automatically be added as admins
  of the organization.
  * If *False*, no LDAP users will be automatically added as admins of
  the organiation.
  * If a string or list of strings, specifies the group DN(s) that will
  be added of the organization if they match any of the specified
  groups.
*remove_admins*: True/False. Defaults to *False*.::
  * When *True*, a user who is not an member of the given groups will be
  removed from the organization's administrative list.

*users*: None, True/False, string or list/tuple of strings. Same rules
apply as for *admins*.

*remove_users*: True/False. Defaults to *False*. Same rules apply as
*remove_admins*.

....
{
"LDAP Organization": {
  "admins": "cn=engineering_admins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com",
  "remove_admins": false,
  "users": [
    "cn=engineering,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com",
    "cn=sales,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com",
    "cn=it,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com"
  ],
  "remove_users": false
},
"LDAP Organization 2": {
  "admins": [
    "cn=Administrators,cn=Builtin,dc=example,dc=com"
  ],
  "remove_admins": false,
  "users": true,
  "remove_users": false
}
}
....

Mapping between team members (users) and LDAP groups. Keys are team
names (will be created if not present). Values are dictionaries of
options for each team's membership, where each can contain the following
parameters:

*organization*: string. The name of the organization to which the team::
  belongs. The team will be created if the combination of organization
  and team name does not exist. The organization will first be created
  if it does not exist.

*users*: None, True/False, string or list/tuple of strings.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
* If *None*, team members will not be updated.
* If *True/False*, all LDAP users will be added/removed as team members.
* If a string or list of strings, specifies the group DN(s). User will
be added as a team member if the user is a member of ANY of these
groups.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*remove*: True/False. Defaults to *False*. When *True*, a user who is
not a member of the given groups will be removed from the team.
