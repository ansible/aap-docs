[[upgrade_venv]]
== Upgrading to

single: execution environment pair: Ansible; executing in a execution
environment pair: migrate to execution environments; virtual
environments pair: build; execution environments

If upgrading from older versions of to 4.0 or later, the controller has
the ability to detect previous versions of virtual environments
associated with Organizations, Inventory, and Job Templates; and inform
you that you will need to migrate to the new model. A brand new
installation of creates two virtualenvs during installation--one is used
to run the controller itself, while the other is used to run Ansible.
Like legacy virtual environments, allow the controller to run in a
stable environment, while allowing you to add or update modules to your
as necessary to run your playbooks. For more information, see
`ug_execution_environments` in the .

Important

When upgrading, it is highly recommended to always rebuild on top of the
base that corresponds to the platform version you are using. See
`ug_build_ees` for more information.

[[migrate_new_venv]]
=== Migrate legacy venvs to

You can have the exact same setup in an that you had in a prior custom
virtual environment by migrating them to the new . Use the `awx-manage`
commands in this section to:

* list of all the current custom virtual environments and their paths
(`list_custom_venvs`)
* view the resources that rely a particular custom virtual environment
(`custom_venv_associations`)
* export a particular custom virtual environment to a format that can be
used to migrate to an (`export_custom_venv`)

. Before you migrate, it is recommended that you view all the custom
virtual environments you currently have running by using the
`awx-manage list` command:

....
$ awx-manage list_custom_venvs
....

Below is an example output when running this command:

image:../../common/source/images/venv-awx-manage-list-custom-venvs.png[image]

The above output shows three custom virtual environments and their
paths. If you have a custom virtual environment that is not located
within the default `/var/lib/awx/venv/` directory path, it will not be
included here.

[arabic, start=2]
. Use the `_associations` command to view what organizations, jobs, and
inventory sources a custom virtual environment is associated with in
order to determine which resources rely on them:

....
$ awx-manage custom_venv_associations /this/is/the/path/
....

Below is an example output when running this command:

image:../../common/source/images/venv-awx-manage-custom-venv-associations.png[image]

[arabic, start=3]
. Select a path for the virtual environment that you want to migrate and
specify it in the `awx-manage export` command:

....
$ awx-manage export_custom_venv /this/is/the/path/
....

The resulting output is essentially the results of executing a
`pip freeze` command. The example shows the contents of the selected
custom virtual environment:

Note

All of these commands can be run with a `-q` option, which removes the
instructional content provided on each output.

Now that you have the output from this `pip freeze` data, you can paste
it into a definition file that can be used to spin up your new using .
Anyone (both normal users and admins) can use to create an . See
`ug_build_ees` in the for further detail.

[[migrate_iso_to_exe]]
=== Migrate isolated instances to execution nodes

The move from isolated instance groups to execution nodes enables
inbound or outbound connections. Contrast this with versions 3.8 and
older where only outbound connections were allowed from controller nodes
to isolated nodes.

Migrating legacy isolated instance groups to execution nodes in order to
function properly in the mesh architecture in 4.1, is a preflight
function of the installer that essentially creates an inventory file
based on your old file. Even though both .ini and .yml files are still
accepted formats, the generated file output is only an .ini file at this
time.

The preflight check leverages Ansible; and Ansible flattens the concept
of children, this means that not every single inventory file can be
replicated exactly, but it is very close. It will be functionally the
same to Ansible, but may look different to you. The automated preflight
processing does its best to create child relationships based on
heuristics, but be aware that the tool lacks the nuance and judgment
that human users have. Therefore, once the file is created, do *NOT* use
it as-is. Check the file over and use it as a template to ensure that
they work well for both you and the Ansible engine.

Here is an example of a before and after preflight check, demonstrating
how Ansible flattens an inventory file and how the installer
reconstructs a new inventory file. To Ansible, both of these files are
essentially the same.

[[mesh_topology_ee]]
=== View mesh topology

single: mesh pair: mesh; graph pair: execution environments; mesh

If you configured a `mesh` topology, the installer can graphically
validate your mesh configuration through a generated graph rendering
tool. The graph is generated by reading the contents of the inventory
file. See the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.1/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_automation_mesh_guide/index[Red
Hat Ansible Automation Platform automation mesh guide] for further
detail.

image:../../common/source/images/mesh-topology-rendering.png[image]

Any given inventory file must include some sort of execution capacity
that is governed by at least one control `node`. That is, it is
unacceptable to produce an inventory file that only
contains control-only nodes, execution-only nodes or hop-only nodes.
There is a tightly coupled relationship
between control and execution nodes that must be respected at all times.
The installer will fail if the inventory files aren't properly defined.
The only exception to this rule would be a single hybrid node, as it
will satisfy the control and execution constraints.

In order to run jobs on an execution node, either the installer needs to
pre-register the node, or user needs to make a PATCH request
to `/api/v2/instances/N/` to change the enabled field to true.

If you have already deployed a mesh topology and want to view node type,
node health, and specific details about each node, see
`ag_topology_viewer` in the .
