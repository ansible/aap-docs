You can send metrics to the {GCP} monitoring system to be visualized in the {GCP} UI.
{AAPonGCP} metrics and logging are disabled by default as there is a cost to send these metrics to GCP.
Refer to link:https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/pricing#monitoring-costs[Cloud Monitoring] and link:https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/pricing[Cloud Logging] respectively for more information.

You can set up GCP monitoring and logging either:

* At deployment time, read xref:con-gcp-setup-at-deployment-time[Setting up monitoring and logging at deployment time], or
* After the deployment
