= Backup and Restore

:context: gcp-backup-restore

[IMPORTANT]
=====
* You must restore with the same operational image version as the backup.

* To backup and restore your {PlatformNameShort} deployment, it is vital to have your existing {PlatformNameShort} administration secret name and value recorded somewhere safe.

* It is also important to take regular manual backups of the Cloud SQL database instance and filestore backups, to ensure a deployment can be restored as close as possible to its previous working state.
=====

The playbooks backup and restore provides backup and restore support for the {AAPonGCP} foundation deployment. 

[NOTE]
====
The restore process deploys a new {PlatformNameShort} with the filestore and SQL database instance being restored to the specified backup.
