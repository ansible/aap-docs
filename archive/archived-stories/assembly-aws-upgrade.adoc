= Upgrading

You can upgrade your existing {PlatformNameShort} deployment to the newer version. 
The upgrade process covers upgrading the {HubName}, {ControllerName}, and extension nodes.
The upgrade process takes roughly the same amount of time as a {PlatformNameShort} deployment install. 
You are required to create a backup before running the upgrade.

[NOTE]
=====
{AAPonAWS} supports sequential upgrades. 
All upgrades should be no more than one major version behind the version you are currently upgrading to. 
For example, to upgrade {PlatformNameShort} to {ImageRef}, you must be on version 2.3.20230221.
=====

.Prerequisites
* Docker must be installed to run the upgrade playbook.
* A Linux or macOS system, where the `ansible-on-clouds-ops` container image will run.
* The upgrade process requires several volumes to be mounted. Prepare a fresh directory to be used for this process.

The following procedures form the upgrade process:

. Backup your {PlatformNameShort} 2.3 stack
* Follow the link:{BaseURL}/ansible_on_clouds/2.3/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_from_aws_marketplace_guide/assembly-aws-backup-and-restore#con-aws-backup-process[Ansible on Clouds 2.3 backup instructions]

. Upgrade {PlatformNameShort}
.. Pull the ansible-on-clouds-ops 2.4 container image
.. Ensure minimum required permissions are met
.. Generate the data file
.. Update the data file
.. Begin upgrading {PlatformNameShort} by running the operational container

. (Optional) Restore the stack from a backup. 
* Follow the link:{BaseURL}/ansible_on_clouds/2.3/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_from_aws_marketplace_guide/assembly-aws-backup-and-restore#con-aws-restore-process[Ansible on Clouds 2.3 restore instructions].
