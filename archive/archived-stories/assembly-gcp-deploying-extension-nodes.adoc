= Deploying extension nodes

:context: gcp-extension-nodes

The foundation deployment is deployed with two {ControllerName} nodes and one {HubName} node by default. 
You can add execution nodes to scale out {AAPonGCP}. 
Extension node offers can be mixed and matched together to scale up and out the {PlatformNameShort} deployment.

You must create a backup of the {PlatformNameShort} deployment before deploying new extension nodes.

The procedure contains the following steps:

. Decide the offer type for the extension nodes.
. Ensure the minimum permissions are met to manage extension nodes.
. Pull the `ansible-on-clouds-ops` container image.
. Generate data files by running the `ansible-on-clouds-ops` container.
. Populate the data file.
. Run the `ansible-on-clouds-ops` container to deploy extension nodes.

.Prerequisite
* A Linux or macOS system (where the ansible-on-clouds-ops container image will run).
* Docker
