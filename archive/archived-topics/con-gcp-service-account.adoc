= Create a service account

You must have a service account to set up {AAPonGCP}.  
This account is used to install and configure the application and remains associated with the {PlatformNameShort} virtual machines. 
You can use an existing service account with the required roles, or the {PlatformNameShort} deployment can create one with the required roles on your behalf. 
If you use an existing account, or link:https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating[create a service account] in advance, it must have the following roles:

* Editor
* Logs Writer
* Cloud SQL Client
* Cloud SQL Instance User
* Secret Manager Secret Accessor
* Compute Network Admin

See link:https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access#single-role[Grant a single role] for steps to add the required roles to your existing service account.

The Compute Network Administrator role is only required at the time of deployment to configure the application properly. 
When installation and configuration are complete, this role can be removed from the service account, which remains configured on the {PlatformNameShort} Virtual Machines.
