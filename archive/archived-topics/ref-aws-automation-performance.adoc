Automating outside of the boundaries of these criteria is not supported, but can still function depending on your automation.

[NOTE]
====
{AAPonAWS} is driven using three m5.large instances, two of which run {PlatformNameShort} and {ControllerName} and one which runs {HubName}. 
The {ControllerName} instances collectively support a standard workload of 100 managed active nodes. 
This operating criteria also supports up to 10 forks for each node. 
The operating criteria was set and tested using output-intensive, chatty workloads that produce 2 messages 7 seconds apart on both {ControllerName} nodes. 
Workloads that are more I/O intensive might not work inside the boundaries of these conditions and can require the use of extension nodes to scale the deployment to support such automation.
