Automating against the managed node allotment in the offer is provided with the following operational expectations. 
Automating outside of the boundaries of these criteria is not supported, but can still function depending on your automation.

| Concurrent Jobs | 10
| Forks per job | 10

[NOTE]
====
{AAPonAWS} is driven using three m5.large instances, two of which run {PlatformNameShort} and {ControllerName} and one which runs {HubName}. 
The {ControllerName} instances collectively support a standard workload of 100 managed active nodes. 
This operating criteria also supports up to 10 forks for each node. 
The operating criteria was set and tested using output-intensive, chatty workloads that produce 2 messages 7 seconds apart on both {ControllerName} nodes. 
Workloads that are more I/O intensive might not work inside the boundaries of these conditions and can require the use of extension nodes to scale the deployment to support such automation.
