== Deprecated and removed features

Some features available in previous releases have been deprecated or removed. Deprecated functionality is still included in {PlatformNameShort} and continues to be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release of this product and is not recommended for new deployments.
The following is a list of major functionality deprecated and removed within {PlatformNameShort} 2.4:

* On-premise component Automation Services Catalog is now removed from {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 onwards.
* With the {PlatformNameShort} 2.4 release, the Execution Environment container image for Ansible 2.9 (ee-29-rhel-8) is no longer loaded into the {ControllerName} configuration by default.
* The process of deploying the application using a new VPC has been deprecated, and the functionality will be removed from {AAPonGCP} in a future release.
