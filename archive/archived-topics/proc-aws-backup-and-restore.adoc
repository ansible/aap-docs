== Backup Process

.Procedure
. Gather the following input variables to create an `extra_vars.yaml` file like below
+
[source, yaml]
----
aws_foundation_stack_name: "my-foundation-stack"
aws_region: us-east-1
aws_backup_vault_name: "Default"
aws_backup_iam_role_arn: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/AWSBackupDefaultServiceRole"
----
.. aws_foundation_stack_name: The name of your existing deployment.
.. aws_region: The region the stack was deployed in.
.. aws_backup_vault_name: The name of the backup vault to store the EFS backup.
.. aws_backup_iam_role_arn: Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS IAM Role that has permissions to perform backup operations.
+
[NOTE]
====
Can use the AWS Backup Default Service Role for this which has the format `arn:aws:iam::<Your AWS Account Number>:role/service-role/AWSBackupDefaultServiceRole` 
====

. Pull the `ansible-on-clouds-ops` container image having the tag with the same version as the foundation deployment
+
[source,bash]
----
$ export IMAGE=registry.redhat.io/ansible-on-clouds/ansible-on-clouds-ops-rhel8:2.2.20230215
$ docker pull $IMAGE
----
for EMEA regions (Europe, Middle East, Africa) run the command below instead
+
[source, bash]
----
$ export IMAGE=registry.redhat.io/ansible-on-clouds/ansible-on-clouds-ops-emea-rhel8:2.2.20230215
$ docker pull $IMAGE
----
+

[NOTE]
=====  
The `ansible-on-clouds-ops` image tag should match the version of your foundation deployment. For example, if your foundation deployment version is 2.2.20230215-00, pull the `ansible-on-clouds-ops` image with tag 2.2.20230215.
=====
. Run the backup playbook as a container

.. Use the following command to run the playbook.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ docker run --rm --env PLATFORM=AWS \
-v <absolute path of extra vars dir>:/extra_vars:ro \
-e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<Your AWS Access Key ID>
-e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<Your AWS Secret Access Key>
$IMAGE \
redhat.ansible_on_clouds.aws_backup_stack \
-e @/extra_vars/extra_vars.yaml
----

.. Replace `<absolute path of extra vars dir>` with the path to your directory where your `extra_vars.yaml` file exists which you have created in step 1 of the backup process and replace `<Your AWS Access Key ID>` and `<Your AWS Secret Access Key>` with the values for the AWS account you want to run the backup with. For more information on finding your AWS account credentials see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-about[Accessing AWS using your AWS credentials].

.. Note the output of the playbook.
+
The playbook will return something like this
+
[source, bash]
----

        {
            "CreationDate": "2023-02-28T21:54:07.515000+00:00",

}
----
+
The playbook will have successfully created an EFS backup and RDS snapshot of your deployment listing the most recent EFS restore point and RDS snapshot information. Make a note of the `rds_db_snapshot_arn` and the latest `RecoveryPointArn`. These will be needed for the restore playbook.

----
.. aws_foundation_stack_name: The name of your existing deployment.

+
[NOTE]
====
If you have a specific RDS snapshot you want to use, you will have to manually find its ARN in the AWS console. You must also ensure the RDS snapshot is a from a AoC deployment with a version matching the version of the `ansible-on-clouds-ops` container you are using to run the restore operation.
==== 
.. aws_backup_restore_point_arn: The ARN of the recovery point you want to use for restore, which can be found from the backup playbook output as `RecoveryPointArn`.
+ 
[NOTE]
==== 
If you have automatic backups set up and you have a specific EFS recovery point you want to use, you will have to manually find its ARN in the AWS console. You must also ensure the EFS recovery point is a from a AoC deployment with a version matching the version of the `ansible-on-clouds-ops` container you are using the run the restore operation.
====
.. aws_backup_iam_role_arn: AWS IAM Role that has permissions to perform backup operations.

[NOTE]
====
Can use the AWS Backup Default Service Role for this which has the format `arn:aws:iam::<Your AWS Account Number>:role/service-role/AWSBackupDefaultServiceRole` 
====
.. aws_s3_bucket: The name of an S3 bucket that the playbook can access to upload a CloudFormation Template.

[source,bash]
----
$ docker run --rm --env PLATFORM=AWS \

.. Replace `<absolute path of extra vars dir>` with the path to your directory where your `extra_vars.yaml` file exists which you have created in step 1 of the restore process and replace `<Your AWS Access Key ID>` and `<Your AWS Secret Access Key>` with the values for the AWS account you want to run the restore with. For more information on finding your AWS account credentials see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-about[Accessing AWS using your AWS credentials].

After successfully running the playbook, you should see a new restored deployment in AWS CloudFormation matching the name provided for it in the `extra_vars.yaml` file.

[NOTE]
====
Access to the restored deployment needs to be configured through a bastion host or VPN. When a connection method is configured, you can log in to {PlatformName} {ControllerName} and {HubName} using your old deployment credentials. 
In addition, all job history, uploaded collections and other records should be in the same state as the restored deployment.
