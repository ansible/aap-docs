= Transit gateways

Transit Gateways provide a more advanced hub-and-spoke peering model than direct VPC peering provides. 
When {AAPonAWS} is peered to this type of model, the hub has an additional peering with the CIDR range deployed for the {PlatformNameShort} from {Market} VPC.
The {AAPonAWS} VPC can be peered to a transit gateway to participate in the peering model that this AWS service provides.
