| Package Name | Description
| `google-osconfig-agent` | The Google OS Configuration Agent uses the management service to deploy, query, and maintain consistent configurations, that is, the desired state and software for your VM instance.
| `google-cloud-ops-agent` | The Ops Agent is the primary agent for collecting telemetry from your Compute Engine instances. 
Combining logging and metrics into a single agent, the Ops Agent uses Fluent Bit for logs, which supports high-throughput logging, and the OpenTelemetry Collector for metrics.

| `gcloud CLI` | The gcloud command line interface is used to configure the {PlatformNameShort} installation.
