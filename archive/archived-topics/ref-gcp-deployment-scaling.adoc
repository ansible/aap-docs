= Deployment scaling

If you want to scale your deployment beyond the initial number of supported managed nodes, {AAPonGCP} can be manually scaled using separately sold extension nodes. 

Extension nodes are additional compute instances that can be deployed to scale-up or scale-out depending on the immediate scaling requirements. 
If your requirements are for higher parallel automation operations you can select compute shapes that scale-up, while if you have a requirement to automate more nodes over time you can select compute shapes that scale out.

Extension nodes are the supported way of extending the capabilities of {AAPonGCP}.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat does not support environments that are extended through customer design and implementation.
