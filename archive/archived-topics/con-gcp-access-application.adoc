When Ansible Automation Platform on GCP is deployed, it is deployed into an isolated VPC and cannot be accessed. The following instructions describe how to connect the VPC used by Ansible Automation Platform on GCP to your existing GCP network.  When connected, you must determine how your users connect to Ansible Automation Platform.  

There are many ways to enable this connectivity such as VPNs, Google Cloud Interconnect, or bastion servers for private network access.  You can also expose the platform with public internet access using GCP services like a Load Balancer.  How your organization configures application access on GCP is outside the scope of Red Hatâ€™s guidelines and support for Ansible Automation Platform on GCP; Red Hat recommends contacting GCP for guidelines on these products and topics.
