= Using an external load balancer

It is possible to expose Ansible {ControllerName} and Ansible {PrivateHubName} to the public internet if you want users to have access to the platform from any internet connected machine. 

This is not recommended as a best practice for security reasons. 

However this implementation can be secured with different GCP tools. 
This section describes how to connect a load balancer that faces the public internet, but it does not include steps to harden access through Google’s security products. 
Only use this approach if you intend to protect the public endpoints with link:https://cloud.google.com/armor/[Google Cloud Armor] or similar product(s).

[NOTE]
====
{AAPonGCP} is deployed with two _internal_ application load balancers. 
These load balancers direct traffic within local VPCs and must remain part of the deployment even if you configure public load balancers.

.Procedure
. Select the main menu from the top left.
. Select *Network Services*. 
If you do not see *Network Services*, then select *View All Products*.
. Select *Load Balancing*. 
. In the top menu, select *CREATE LOAD BALANCER*.
. Select the *Application Load Balancer (HTTP/S)* tile and click btn:[START CONFIGURATION].
. Select *From Internet to my VMs or serverless services* and *Global external Application Load Balancer*.
. Click btn:[CONTINUE].
. Give your load balancer a name, for example, `<DeploymentName>-aap-<cntrlr/hub>-ext-lb`
. Ensure that *Frontend* configuration is selected at the left of the screen.
. On the *Frontend* configuration page, complete the following fields:
* *Protocol*: HTTPS.
* *Port*: 443.
* *IP Address*: Select an existing IP address or create a new one.
* *Certificate*: You can use your own SSL Certificate or use a Google managed certificate.
* *SSL Policy*: GCP default, or another configured policy.

. Click btn:[DONE].
. Select *Backend configuration* from the menu on the left.
. Click the *Backend services & backend buckets* drop-down.
. Click btn:[CREATE A BACKEND SERVICE].
.. Give your backend service a name, for example, `<DeploymentName>-aap-<cntrlr/hub>-ext-lb-bknd-svc`
.. Set *Backend type* to *Instance group*.
.. Set *Protocol* to `HTTPS` and *Named Port* to `https`.
.. Change *Timeout* to `86400`.
.. Scroll down to the *Backends* section and in the *New backend* field, select the *Instance group* drop-down. 
Select the correct instance group.
+
For the {Controllername} load balancer, the correct instance group has the suffix `-aap-cntrlr-igm`.
+
For the {HubName} load balancer, the correct instance group has the suffix `-aap-hub-igm`.
.. In the resulting dialog box, select *USE EXISTING PORT NAME*.
.. Set *Balancing mode* to *Rate*.
.. Set *Maximum RPS* to 300.
.. Scroll down until you see *Cloud CDN*. Unselect the checkbox for *Cloud CDN*.
.. Scroll down until you see a text box showing *Health check*. 
.. Select the drop-down menu and click btn:[CREATE A HEALTH CHECK].
.. Enter a name for your health check, for example, `<DeploymentName>-aap-<cntrlr/hub>-ext-lb-hc`
.. For {Controllername}, use the following health check settings
* In the *Health Check* dialog box, set *Protocol* to `HTTPS`, and *Port* to `8052`.
* Set *Request* to `/api/v2/ping/`.
.. For {HubName}, use the following health check settings
* In the *Health Check* dialog box, set *Protocol* to `HTTPS`, and *Port* to `8080`.
* Set *Request* to `/api/galaxy/pulp/api/v3/status/`.
.. Scroll down to *Health criteria* section.
.. In the *Check interval* field, enter the value 15.
.. In the *Timeout* field, enter the value 10.
.. In the *Healthy threshold* field, enter the value 2.
.. In the *Unhealthy threshold* field, enter the value 10.
.. Click btn:[SAVE].
+
This returns you to the *Backend services & backend buckets* window.
.. Click btn:[CREATE].
+
This returns you to *Backend configuration* section.
.. Click btn:[OK].
.. Click btn:[CREATE] to create the load balancer for the {ControllerName} or {HubName} UI.  
This will take a few minutes to complete. 
. A load balancer has now been created. 
. Configure the DNS record for the domain that you used in your SSL certificate to point to the IP address of the load balancer.  

At this point you should have accesss to the {PlatformNameShort} {Controllername} UI.  
You can log in after you retrieve the administration password.

Repeat the same process for {PrivateHubName}.
The process is identical except for selecting the instance group `-aap-hub-igm` during backend configuration.
