= Restoring the {PlatformNameShort} deployment

Use the following procedures to ensure a smooth restore process.

[NOTE]
====
A restored deployment contains the same VPC networking setup as the original backed up deployment. If a backed up deployment was deployed within an existing VPC, its restored deployment is also deployed into that VPC. If a backed up deployment was deployed with a new VPC, its restored deployment is also deployed with a new VPC.
