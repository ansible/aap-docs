= Transit gateway

Transit Gateways provide a more advanced hub-and-spoke peering model than direct VPC peering provides. 
When {PlatformNameShort} on GCP is peered to this type of model, the hub has an additional peering with the CIDR range deployed for the {PlatformNameShort} on GCP VPC.
The {PlatformNameShort} on GCP VPC can be peered to a Transit Gateway to participate in the peering model that this GCP service provides. 
Follow [TBD] for configuring a transit gateway.
