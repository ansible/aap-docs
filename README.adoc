== Generating HTML previews

Merging a commit to the repository automatically generates HTML previews.
If necessary, you can build HTML previews locally as follows:

[source,bash]
----
$ asciidoctor titles/aap-on-azure/aap-on-azure.asciidoc
$ firefox titles/aap-on-azure/aap-on-azure.html
----

=== Undoing local HTML previews

Generating HTML previews locally can result in merge conflicts with `*.html` files.
This happens when `*.html` files are automatically generated and added to the repository after merge.
The merge adds a new commit with changes to an `*.html` file that conflict changes in your locally built preview.

Before you commit changes and send a PR, you should checkout the latest preview.
Doing this overrides your local HTML with the generated one.
However, when your commit is merged, the preview will generate HTML with your changes.

[source,bash]
----
# Make sure your remotes are up to date.
$ git fetch
# For example, check out the Azure html to reset changes from a local build.
$ git checkout titles/aap-on-azure/aap-on-azure.html
