= {SaaSonAWS} PULL and PUSH models

// You can configure communication between control nodes and execution nodes using one of the following models:
// 
// * The PULL connectivity model (recommended)
// * The PUSH connectivity model 

//[gmurray] this module seems to duplicate the introduction so commenting out for now while I confirm it's not needed
// [ariordan] Added it back in per PR review coments - removed duplicated section from 1st chapter.
