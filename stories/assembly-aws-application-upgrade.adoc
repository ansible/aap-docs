= {AAPonAWS} Upgrade Process

:context: aws-application-upgrade

You can upgrade your existing {AAPonAWS} deployment to the newer version. 
The upgrade process covers upgrading of {HubName} and {ControllerName}. 
The upgrade process takes roughly the same amount of time as a {AAPonAWS} deployment install. 
The upgrade process also backs up {PlatformNameShort}.

[NOTE]
=====
{AAPonAWS} supports sequential upgrades. 
All upgrades should be no more than one major version behind the version you are currently upgrading to.
