{AAPonGCP} is a self-managed deployment. 
When the application is deployed into your GCP infrastructure, customers are responsible for the maintenance of the GCP infrastructure, OS patching, and {PlatformNameShort} patching. 
However, Red Hat does not support any changes to the infrastructure resources deployed as part of the solution unless there is documentation by Red Hat to do so, such as in route table configuration for networking or documented upgrade processes. 
Adding additional compute resources outside of extension nodes voids Red Hat support for the {AAPonGCP} deployment.
