When {AAPonGCP} is deployed, it is installed into an isolated VPC and cannot be accessed. 
The following instructions describe how to connect the VPC used by {AAPonGCP} to your existing GCP network. 
When connected, you must determine how your users connect to {PlatformNameShort}.  

There are many ways to enable this connectivity such as VPNs, Google Cloud Interconnect, or bastion servers for private network access. 
You can also expose the platform with public internet access using GCP services such as a Load Balancer. 

How your organization configures application access on GCP is outside the scope of Red Hatâ€™s guidelines and support for {AAPonGCP}.
