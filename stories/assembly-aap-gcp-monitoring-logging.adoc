You can send metrics to the {GCP} monitoring system to be visualized in the {GCP} UI.
{PlatformNameShort} from {AAPonGCP} metrics and logging are disabled by default as there is a cost to send these metrics to GCP.
Refer to link:https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/pricing#monitoring-costs[Cloud Monitoring] and link:https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/pricing[Cloud Logging] respectively for more information.

Metrics are provided by link:https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/administration/metrics.html[Ansible], link:https://github.com/containers/prometheus-podman-exporter[Podman] and link:https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/solutions/agents/ops-agent[Google Ops Agent].
Ansible metrics is only installed on {HubName}, the Google Ops Agent and Podman are also installed on {ControllerName}s.

A configurable process (collector) runs on each {ControllerName} and {HubName} to export the collected Ansible and Podman metrics to {GCP} Monitoring.
As the Google Ops Agent is part of the Google Cloud solution, it has its own configuration file.

The Google Ops Agent is also responsible for the logging configuration.

The service APIs `monitoring.googleapis.com` and `logging.googleapis.com` must be respectively enabled for the monitoring and logging capabilities.

.Configuration

Configuration files are located on a disk shared by each {ControllerName} and {HubName}.
Modify the file `/aap/bootstrap/config_file_templates/<controller|hub>/monitoring.yaml` to configure all exporters and agents.
