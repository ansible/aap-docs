= Execution plane
The ability to run jobs on the default or controller execution planes is limited to test and cleanup jobs. 
You must configure all automation to happen on your execution plane.
You are provided with 10 Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) entitlements for running the execution plane as part of the {SaaSonAWSShort} subscription.  Additional RHEL or OpenShift licenses can be purchased separately.
