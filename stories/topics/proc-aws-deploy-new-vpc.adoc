[NOTE]
====
The following procedure assumes that you have a marketplace offer. 
The instructions are a continuation from xref:proc-aws-marketplace[{Market}].
Complete the procedure in that section before continuing with this section.
====

This procedure creates a new VPC network and deploys the application in the created VPC.

It is crucial to ensure the CIDR ranges provided for your subnets are within your VPC CIDR range and do not overlap with each other to avoid CIDR collisions.
 
You can look at the default subnet CIDR ranges as a point of reference.
