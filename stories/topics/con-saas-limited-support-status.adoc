= Limited support status

When a deployment transitions to a "Limited Support" status, Red{nbsp}Hat no longer troubleshoots issues related to the execution plane. 
The SLA is no longer applicable and credits requested against the SLA are denied. 
It does not mean that you no longer have product support. 
A deployment can return to a fully-supported status if you remediate the violating factors (see examples below). 

A deployment might move to a Limited Support status for many reasons, including the following scenarios:

If you do not implement an execution plane:: A customer execution plane is required for automation to be performed. 
If you have not yet configured an execution plane, or have an execution plane in a degraded state, you must correct issues with the execution plane prior to support for automation being provided.
If you do not maintain the execution plane with supported dependencies:: 
Both Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and OpenShift-based execution planes require maintenance and upgrades to ensure that those resources maintain the minimum supported versions for {PlatformNameShort} dependencies.
You can Upgrade these resources through different models. For example, you can use Ansible for patching, Red Hat Satellite, and DNF automatic.
Ensuring that the OS, cluster, and receptor resources are up-to-date with supported {PlatformNameShort} versions reduces a support dependency impact.
