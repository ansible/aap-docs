= Limited support status

When a deployment transitions to a "Limited Support" status, Red{nbsp}Hat no longer troubleshoots issues related to the execution plane. 
The SLA is no longer applicable and credits requested against the SLA are denied. 
It does not mean that you no longer have product support. 
A deployment can return to a fully-supported status if you remediate the violating factors (see examples below). 

A deployment might move to a Limited Support status for many reasons, including the following scenarios:

If you do not implement an execution plane:: A customer execution plane is required for automation to be performed. 
If you have not yet configured an execution plane, or that have an execution plane in a degraded state, you will be asked to correct issues with the execution plane prior to support for automation being provided.
If you do not maintain the execution plane with supported dependencies:: 
Both Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and OpenShift-based execution planes will require maintenance and upgrades to ensure that those resources maintain the minimum supported versions for {PlatformNameShort} dependencies. Upgrading these resources can be achieved through different models; Ansible may be used for patching, Red Hat Satellite, and DNF automatic are a few examples.
Ensuring that the OS, cluster, and receptor resources are up-to-date with supported {PlatformNameShort} versions will reduce a support dependency impact.
