= DNS

Execution nodes use the DNS configuration of the host machine for DNS queries. Configure DNS using standard RHEL network practices to ensure proper lookups during automation execution.

To request a custom DNS for your control plane, you can submit a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/#/case/new/get-support?caseCreate=true[customer support request] with the vanity URL and SSL certificate information. The Red Hat support team will then use this information to enable the custom URL on the instances.
