//Included this paragraph from the 5.3.4. DNS section in the 5.3 Execution plane section. Asking reviewers to approve or advise if this should be removed.

To request a custom DNS for your control plane, you can submit a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/#/case/new/get-support?caseCreate=true[customer support request] with the vanity URL and SSL certificate information.
