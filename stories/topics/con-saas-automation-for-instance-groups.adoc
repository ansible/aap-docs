= Configure automation to use instance groups

[role="_abstract"]
{SaaSonAWS} requires that customers implement their own automation execution plane.

Job templates must use a customer-configured instance or container group to run.
If omitted, job runs can seem non-functional and eventually time out due to automation execution failure.
Each job template must be assigned to a customer-configured instance group to function.
