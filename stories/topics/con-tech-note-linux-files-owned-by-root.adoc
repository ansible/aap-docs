= Command generator - Linux files owned by root

On Linux, any file or directory created by the command generator is owned by `root:root` by default. To change the ownership of the files and directories, you can run the `sudo chmod` command after the files are created:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
# Change the owner of the command_generator_data directory recursively
$ sudo chown -R $USER:$USER command_generator_data/

# Check the permissions
$ ls -la command_generator_data/
----

The command generator currently expects the usage of the Docker CLI in the link:https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/[daemon mode]. The default Docker installation link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/userns-remap/#enable-userns-remap-on-the-daemon[do not have User namespace mapping] for Discretionary access control (DAC).

You can learn more about the Linux namespaces, including the User namespace at the article link:https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/7-linux-namespaces[The 7 most used Linux namespaces].
