= Configuring direct network peering

You can configure network peering between your Azure network and your VNet in the *Virtual Networks* page of the Azure Portal. 

Within the Azure console, the Azure virtual network is known as _this virtual network_, and the VNet that you want to peer with is known as _remote virtual network_.

In the *Virtual Networks* page in the Azure portal, use the following settings to configure the Azure network and the VNet that you want to peer with the {AAPonAzureNameShort} app:

* Under *Remote virtual network*, select the settings for the virtual network that you want to peer with Azure:
** *Summary*:
*** *Peering link name*: _<aap_to_hub_peering_link_name>_
*** *Subscription*: Select the subscription where you deployed the {AAPonAzureNameShort}.
*** *Virtual network*: Select the {AAPonAzureNameShort} virtual network: vnet-<aap_identifier>-<region>
** *Peering settings*:
*** *Traffic to remote virtual network*: _Allow_
*** *Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network*: _Allow_
*** *Virtual network gateway or Route Server*: _Use the remote virtual networkâ€™s gateway or Route server_
* Under *Local virtual network*, select the settings the {AAPonAzureNameShort} virtual network:
** *Summary*:
*** *Peering link name*: _<hub_to_aap_peering_link_name>_
*** *Traffic to remote virtual network*: _Allow_
*** *Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network*: _Allow_
*** *Enable this virtual network to use peered vnet's remote gateway or Route Sever*: _Enabled_

After you have configured direct network peering, traffic routes between {AAPonAzureNameShort} and private hosts and IPs on your Vnet.
