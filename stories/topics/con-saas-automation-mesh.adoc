= Automation mesh

{SaaSonAWSShort} has “mesh-ingress” hop nodes available by default. 
These are the hosted hop nodes that enable execution nodes to poll for automation work through egress from a customer’s private network, as opposed to opening an inbound firewall port. 
Mesh ingress hop nodes use port 443 for inbound traffic.

The following is an example of an execution node in a private address space with egress-only internet access connected to {SaaSonAWSShort} through this model.

It is also possible to configure automation mesh with outbound connectivity from the control plane to your execution plane. 
In this model, you can configure the ports that are used by the automation mesh.
