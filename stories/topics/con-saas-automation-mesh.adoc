= Automation mesh

{SaaSonAWSShort} provides default “mesh-ingress” hop nodes.
These hosted hop nodes allow execution nodes to poll for automation work through egress from a customer’s private network, eliminating the need to open inbound firewall ports.
Mesh ingress hop nodes use port 443 for inbound traffic.

The following is an example of an execution node in a private address space with egress-only internet access connected to {SaaSonAWSShort} through this model.

You can also configure the automation mesh with outbound connectivity from the control plane to your execution plane, allowing you to specify the ports used by the automation mesh.
