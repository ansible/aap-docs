= Transit gateway

Transit Gateways provide a more advanced hub-and-spoke peering model than direct VPC peering provides. 
When {PlatformnameShort} on AWS is peered to this type of model, the hub has an additional peering with the CIDR range deployed for {PlatformNameShort} on AWS VPC.
{PlatformNameShort} on AWS VPC can be peered to a Transit Gateway to participate in the peering model that this AWS service provides. 
Follow link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-getting-started.html[instructions from AWS] for configuring a transit gateway.
