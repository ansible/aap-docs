= Routing to {AAPonAzureNameShort}

use the *Route Tables* page in the Azure portal to route traffic to {PlatformNameShort}.

.Procedure 

. Navigate to *Route Tables* in the Azure portal.
. As part of your hub-and-spoke configuration, you created one or more route tables to define the routes between the networks. Click on one of these route tables.
. From the route table menu bar, click *Routes* > *Add*.
. Configure routes from your existing networks to send traffic to {PlatformNameShort}. You must configure routes for any network requesting {PlatformNameShort} user interfaces and for any network that will have automation performed against its resources.
For each route that you add, enter the following information:
** *Route name*: Enter a route name for the {PlatformNameShort} managed application network
** *Address Prefix*: The CIDR block of the managed application kubernetes cluster
** *Next Hop Type*: _Virtual network gateway_
. Click *OK* to save the new route to the route list.
. Repeat this procedure for all other route tables where you want to route traffic to {PlatformNameShort}.
