= Accessing the application

When {AAPonAWS} is deployed, it is deployed into an isolated VPC and cannot be accessed. 
The following sections describe how to connect the VPC used by {AAPonAWS} to your existing AWS network. 

When connected, you must determine how your users connect to {PlatformNameShort}. 

There are many ways to enable this connectivity such as VPNs, Direct Connect, or bastion servers for private network access. 
You can also expose the platform with public internet access using AWS services such as a Load Balancer. 
How your organization configures application access on AWS is outside the scope of Red Hatâ€™s guidelines and support for {AAPonAWS}. 
Red Hat recommends contacting link:https://aws.amazon.com/[{AWS}] for guidelines on these products and topics.
