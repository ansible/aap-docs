= Automation using the {SaaSonAWS} control plane 

The control plane {ControllerName} is the command center to run automation. 
However, before automation can begin, the control plane must be configured to reach the execution nodes.
The nature of the hosted control plane and remote execution plane requires traffic over networks to be set up securely. 
{SaaSonAWSShort} implements a service architecture based on industry standard communication protocols and modern encryption algorithms to ensure that traffic between the control plane is secure.

There are two ways to configure the communication between control nodes and execution nodes:

* Mesh ingress
* Self-managed hop nodes (egress model)
