= Automation using the {SaaSonAWS} control plane 

The control plane is the command center to run automation. 
Before automation can begin, the control plane must be configured to reach the execution nodes.
Secure network traffic is essential for the hosted control plane and remote execution plane. 
{SaaSonAWSShort} uses industry-standard communication protocols and modern encryption to keep this traffic secure.

There are two ways to configure the communication between control nodes and execution nodes:

* The mesh egress model, also known as PULL connectivity (recommended)
* The mesh ingress model, also known as PUSH connectivity
