= Automation using the {SaaSonAWS} control plane 

[role="_abstract"]
The {SaaSonAWS} offers a deployment of {PlatformNameShort} deployment purchased through AWS Marketplace. Red{nbsp}Hat configures and provisions an {PlatformNameShort}. The Red{nbsp}Hat team handles the setup and maintenance of the {PlatformNameShort}, ensuring reliability and security.

While Red{nbsp}Hat manages the control plane, the execution plane is implemented in your network using automation mesh hop nodes and execution nodes.
For help with configuring execution nodes see
_link:{LinkOperatorMesh}_.

There are two ways to configure the communication between control nodes and execution nodes:

* The PULL connectivity model (recommended)
* The PUSH connectivity model
