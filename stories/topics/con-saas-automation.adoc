= Automation using the {SaaSonAWS} control plane 

The {SaaSonAWS} offers a deployment of {PlatformNameShort} deployment purchased through AWS Marketplace. Red{nbsp}Hat configures and provisions an {PlatformNameShort}. The Red{nbsp}Hat team handles the setup and maintenance of the {PlatformNameShort}, ensuring reliability and security.

While Red{nbsp}Hat manages the control plane, the execution plane is spread across your domains using automation mesh hop nodes and execution nodes. For help with configuring execution nodes see link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/automation_mesh_for_managed_cloud_or_operator_environments/index[Automation mesh for managed cloud or operator environments].

There are two ways to configure the communication between control nodes and execution nodes:

* The mesh egress model, also known as PULL connectivity (recommended)
* The mesh ingress model, also known as PUSH connectivity
