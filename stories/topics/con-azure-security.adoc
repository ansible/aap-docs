{AAPonAzureNameShort} follows security best practices from both Red Hat and Microsoft.
The following resources describe the security posture of the application and the infrastructure.

* Data encryption in flight and at rest
** link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-atrest#azure-storage[All Azure Storage Services enable server-side encryption by default using service-managed keys]
** link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-atrest#conclusion[All Azure hosted services are committed to providing Encryption at Rest options]
** link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-overview[Azure encryption overview]
** All communications between services within Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) (for example, {PlatformNameShort}, Postgres, storage accounts) use Transport Layer Security (TLS) v1.2 or higher.
** link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/azure-kubernetes-service-aks-security-baseline[Azure security baseline for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)]
* Password storage
** The customer-supplied {PlatformNameShort} admin password is encrypted in transit.
It is accessible to site reliability engineers (SREs) from the Kubernetes API and can be reset by the SREs upon customer request.
* Keys generated with industry standards
** link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-overview#azure-storage-service-encryption[Data in Azure Storage is encrypted and decrypted transparently using 256-bit AES encryption, one of the strongest block ciphers available, and is FIPS 140-2 compliant]
* Key installation, rotation
** link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-models#key-access[Microsoft manages key rotation, backup, and redundancy]
* SSL/TLS traffic encryption
** All communications between services within AKS (for example, {PlatformNameShort}, Postgres, storage accounts) use TLS v1.2 or higher.
** All communications to {PlatformNameShort} UIs, either via the application gateway for public deployments or the nginx ingress for private deployments, use TLS v1.2 or higher.
* API security
** Any parts of the {PlatformNameShort} APIs that could leak any sensitive information are only accessible via authenticating as a known {PlatformNameShort} user and require that user to have the right level of authorization to use those APIs.
In a private deployment, access to the {PlatformNameShort} APIs is only accessible to the customer via the route they choose to connect to the private deployment.
** The Kubernetes API is private and only accessible from a private endpoint
** Workload identity is enabled and it allows Kubernetes applications to access Azure cloud resources securely with {MSEntraID}.
* Updates and patching
** The Red Hat SREs regularly update the Kubernetes version, underlying node OS, and {PlatformNameShort} version to the latest available stable versions to get the latest features, bug fixes, and security fixes.
