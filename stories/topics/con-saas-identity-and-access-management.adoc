= Identity and access management

{PlatformNameShort} has a built-in user model that may be used to configure users and RBAC permissions that define user access.
Red{nbsp}Hat encourages you to configure and use an enterprise identity provider with {PlatformNameShort} to implement multi-factor authentication for users.
See the link:{BaseURL}/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/automation_controller_administration_guide/controller-set-up-enterprise-authentication[Setting up enterprise authentication] section of {PlatformNameShort} documentation for a configuration guide.
[NOTE]
====
Red{nbsp}Hat recommends that at least one local administrator account be retailed with a long and complex password in the event of a break-glass authentication requirement.
