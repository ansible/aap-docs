= Routing to your VPCs

You must configure route tables to your existing networks to send traffic from {PlatformNameShort} VPC CIDR to any network that has automation performed against resources in those networks.

.Procedure
. In the GCP console, navigate to menu:VPC[].
. Click btn:[Route Tables] in the left menu.
. Select the route table associated with {PlatformNameShort} from the GCP Marketplace VPC.
. Click btn:[Edit Routes].
. Click btn:[Add Route].
. In the *Destination* field, enter the CIDR block of the VPC that you peered to the {PlatformNameShort} VPC.
. In the *Target field*, select Peering Connection.  
A list of peering connections from this VPC is displayed. 
Select the ID for the peering connection with your existing VPC from the list. 
At this stage, you should only have one VPC peered with the {PlatformNameShort} on GCP VPC, so only one option should appear.
. Click btn:[Save changes].

When you have configured the routing rules then traffic should successfully route traffic to and from {PlatformNameShort} on GCP though your hub network.
