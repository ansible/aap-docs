= Upgrading your deployment

You can upgrade your existing {AAPonGCP} deployment to the newer version. 
The upgrade process covers upgrading of {HubName} and {ControllerName}. 
The upgrade process takes roughly the same amount of time as a {AAPonGCP} deployment install. 

Use the following procedure to ensure a smooth upgrade process.

[NOTE]
=====
{AAPonGCP} supports sequential upgrades. 
All upgrades should be no more than one major version behind the version you are currently upgrading to. 
For example, to upgrade to {AAPonGCP} to 2.2.20230215, you must be on the first version of {AAPonGCP}.
=====

.Prerequisites
* Docker must be installed to run the upgrade playbook.
* The upgrade process requires several volumes to be mounted. 
Prepare a fresh directory to be used for this process.

.Procedure
. Create the directories used to configure the upgrade process using the following commands:
+
[source,bash]
----
# Secrets directory. Store the GCP credentials file.
$ mkdir secrets
# Extra vars directory. All the configuration variables for the upgrade process.
$ mkdir extra_vars
----
+
. Store your service account credential json file in the secrets directory. 
+
[NOTE]
=====
To create the GCP credentials file, see, 
link:https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials[Create credentials] and 
link:https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete[Create and delete service account keys]
=====
+
. Gather the following input variables to create an `extra_vars.yaml` file within `extra_vars` dir.
* *gcp_service_account_credentials_json_path*:  Service account crendential json file path for the google cloud account.  This is the path within an `ansible-on-clouds-ops` container where the credentials json file is mounted to the `/secrets` directory. The path should be `/secrets/<service-account-creds-json-filename>`. 
+
Replace `<service-account-creds-json-filename>` with your google service account credential filename.

* *gcp_deployment_name*: Deployment name that you want to upgrade.
* *gcp_compute_region*: GCP region that you provided when deploying foundation deployment. 
If you have not provided a region when deploying the foundation, use the default region `us-east1` here.
* *gcp_compute_zone*: GCP zone that you provided when deploying foundation deployment. 
If you have not provided a zone when deploying the foundation, use the default `us-east1-b` here.
+
[NOTE]
=====
You can find the region and zone from the filestore instance deployed with the foundation deployment. 
Look for the filestore with the name `<deployment-name>-filestore`.

* Make note of the location field that is your `gcp_compute_zone`. 
For example, the filestore instance location might be `us-east1-d`

* Remove the last two bits from the location that is your `gcp_compute_region`. 
For example, if your `gcp_compute_zone` location is `us-east1-d`, your region is `us-east1`.
=====

[source,bash]
----
gcp_service_account_credentials_json_path: "/secrets/<service-account-creds-json-filename>"
gcp_deployment_name: "" 
gcp_compute_region: ""
gcp_compute_zone: ""
----
+
. The final result should look similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ tree
tree

│   └── extra_vars.yaml
└── secrets
    └── gc-ansible-cloud-123434.json

= Running the upgrade playbook

The following instructions describe how to run the upgrade playbook.

.Procedure
. Pull the docker image for the `ansible-on-clouds-ops` container with a tag the same as the version of the foundation deployment.
+
[NOTE]
=====
The `ansible-on-clouds-ops` container image tag must match the version of your foundation deployment. 
For example, if your foundation deployment version is 2.2.1, pull the `ansible-on-clouds-ops` image with tag 2.2.1.
=====
+
[source,bash]
----
$ docker pull $IMAGE
$ export IMAGE=quay.io/ansible-on-clouds/ansible-on-clouds-ops:2.2.1
----

== Running the upgrade playbook as a container

.Procedure
. Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` variable to the google cloud credential json file path.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<path to the google credential json file>
----
+
. Replace `<absolute path to secrets dir>` with the path to the service account credential json file for google cloud.
. Replace `<absolute path of extra vars dir>` with the path to the directory where your `extra_vars.yaml` file exists.
. Replace `<google-cloud-project-id>` with the project id for your google account.
. Replace `<deployment-name>` with your foundation deployment name.
. Use the following command to run the playbook.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ docker run --rm \
  --env PLATFORM=GCP \
  --env CLOUDSDK_CORE_PROJECT=<google-cloud-project-id> \
  --env GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS \
  --env GENERATE_INVENTORY=true \
  --env DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<deployment-name> \
  -v <absolute path to secrets dir>:/secrets:ro \
  -v <absolute path of extra vars dir>:/extra_vars:ro \
  $IMAGE \
  redhat.ansible_on_clouds.gcp_upgrade \
  -e @/extra_vars/extra_vars.yaml
----
+
. After successfully running the playbook, the playbook returns something similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
TASK [redhat.ansible_on_clouds.standalone_gcp_upgrade : [upgrade] Show GCP current version] ***
ok: [localhost] => {
    "msg": "AAP on GCP upgrade succeeded to version: 2.2.20230215-00"
}
----

. Your {AAPonGCP} deployment is now upgraded to newer version and you can now successfully log in to {PlatformName} {ControllerName} and {HubName} using your deployment credentials.
