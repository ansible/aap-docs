= DNS

Execution nodes use the Domain Name System (DNS) configuration of the host machine for DNS queries. 
Configure DNS using standard RHEL network practices to ensure proper lookups during automation execution.

You can request a custom DNS for your control plane instances by submitting a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/#/case/new/get-support?caseCreate=true[Customer support request] with the vanity URL and SSL certificate information. 
The Red Hat support team will take the information and enable custom URL on the instances.
