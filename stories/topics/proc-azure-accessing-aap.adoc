= Accessing {AAPonAzureName}

[role="_abstract"]
When you initiate the deployment of the {PlatformName} managed app from Azure marketplace, a form displays in the *Create Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure* window.
Complete the form to provision {PlatformNameShort} infrastructure and resources into your Azure tenant.

.Procedure

. In a web browser, navigate to the *Managed Applications* section in the Azure console.
. Select the instance of {AAPonAzureNameShort} that you deployed.
. Select *Parameters and Outputs* in the *Settings* section in the left navigation menu.
* If this is your first time accessing your {PlatformNameShort} through the Azure portal, you must select and copy the deploymentEngineUrl under the *output* section to continue setting up your deployment.
+
====
NOTE: After you set up your instance through the deploymentEngineUrl, it is removed from the outputs section because it is no longer needed. Trying to reuse the URL results in a `404 Not Found` error.
====
+
* If you have already set up your {PlatformNameShort} deployment, you can go directly to it by copying the platformUrl output. 
. Paste the selected URL into your browser search bar and hit enter. This brings you to your {PlatformNameShort} deployment.
. The first time you log in to {PlatformNameShort} with the URL, you must configure the subscription. For help see the _Logging in for the first time_ section of the link:{URLGettingStarted}[{TitleGettingStarted}] guide.


====
NOTE: When upgrading your {AAPonAzureNameShort} version from 2.4 to 2.5, your previous {ControllerName} and {HubName} URLs continue to display under the outputs section.
Selecting these URLs redirects you to the {PlatformNameShort}. 

These redirects will eventually be deprecated, Red{nbsp}Hat recommends using the {PlatformNameShort} URL to access the platform.
