= Updating the backup data file

You must populate the data file before triggering the backup. 
The following variables are parameters listed in the data file.

* `cloud_credentials_path` is the path to your AWS credentials file.
* `deployment_name` is the name of the foundation deployment. This is the same name you used when you deployed the foundation.
* `aws_backup_iam_role_arn` is the _Amazon Resource Name_ (ARN) of the AWS IAM Role that has permissions to perform backup operations.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can use the AWS Backup Default Service Role for this which has the format `arn:aws:iam::<Your AWS Account Number>:role/service-role/AWSBackupDefaultServiceRole`. 
====
+
* `aws_backup_vault_name` is the name of the backup vault that will hold the EFS recovery points.
+
[NOTE]
====
Please ensure the referenced backup vault exists and the AWS Backup IAM role provided above has the required permissions to create an EFS recovery point inside the vault. 
====
+
* `aws_region` is the region the stack was deployed in.
* `aws_s3_bucket` is the name of the S3 bucket where the backup files are stored. 
This creates a new bucket if one does not already exist. 
Only the most recent backup is stored in the bucket. 
Every subsequent backup to the same bucket overwrites the backup files with the latest backup.
For guidance on bucket naming, see link:https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1682584492105680&usg=AOvVaw0WgUwkieoKwP4tRrvSpFBC[Bucket naming rules]

When you have populated the data file, it should resemble the following. 
The values in this file are provided as examples:

[source,bash]
