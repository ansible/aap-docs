= Azure resource providers

Microsoft uses Azure resource providers as a set of REST operations that enable functionality for a specific Azure service in an Azure subscription. For example, the Key Vault service consists of a resource provider named Microsoft.KeyVault. The resource provider defines REST operations for managing vaults, secrets, keys, and certificates.

The resource provider defines the Azure resources you can deploy in your Azure subscription.
