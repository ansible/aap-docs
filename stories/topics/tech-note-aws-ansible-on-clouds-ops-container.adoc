= Ansible on Clouds Ops Container

Having a deployment with the same name in multiple regions will break the functionality of the add extension node, remove extension node and backup stack playbooks found in the Ansible on Clouds Ops Container. To ensure these playbooks function as expected, please ensure that {AAPonAWS} deployments are uniquely named across all regions.
