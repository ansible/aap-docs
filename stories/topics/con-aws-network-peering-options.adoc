= Network peering options

Many networking configurations are possible, but the following configurations have been validated to work with {PlatformNameShort} from {Market} by Red Hat.

Private deployments omit access from the public internet. 
This is the default deployment model based on the AWS architecture used by {AAPonAWS}.

If you use this approach you must configure VPC peering, a transit network gateway, or similar AWS networking connectivity to access {AAPonAWS}.  

When VPC peering and routing are configured, you can access {PlatformNameShort} through a VM on a connected VPC subnet, or directly if your organization has a transit routing setup between AWS and your local networks.

Network peering is required for {PlatformNameShort} to access resources that reside on private VPCs or where transit routing between AWS and your on-premises networks exists. 

{PlatformNameShort} requires peering and routing for outbound communication to perform automations against devices on your AWS networks and connected on-premise or multi-cloud networks.

AWS offers different ways to peer private networks together. 
This document focuses on basic network peering and routing models:

[cols="10%,40%",options="header"]
|====
| Peering type | Description
| link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/peering-configurations-full-access.html[VPC Peering] | VPCs are individually connected to one another with no other routing hops between them. 
This is a simple peering model and is useful when connecting a few networks. 
Complex peering can be configured, but routing can become more complex over time.
| link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/what-is-transit-gateway.html[Transit Gateway] | A transit gateway is a network transit hub that you can use to interconnect your virtual private clouds (VPCs) and on-premises networks. 
As your cloud infrastructure expands globally, inter-Region peering connects transit gateways together using the AWS Global Infrastructure. 
Your data is automatically encrypted and never travels over the public internet.

There are also ways that AWS directs organizations not to attempt to peer networks in their link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/invalid-peering-configurations.html[Invalid network peering] document.
