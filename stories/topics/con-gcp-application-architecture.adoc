= Application architecture

{PlatformName} from {GCPMarket} is installed into infrastructure resources running within your GCP account.

There are four virtual machines included in this product listing.  
Three n2-standard-2 virtual machines make up the permanent compute components of the solution.  
Additionally, a single ephemeral e2-medium instance is used to run {PlatformName} and Google Cloud deployment workloads. 
This virtual machine is only used during deployment and then is permanently removed from the solution.  
The infrastructure cost for the ephemeral VM is charged at the hourly rate during the period that the VM exists, usually less than an hour.

== GCP infrastructure

== Architecture Description

{AAPonGCP} was designed to be private, with no public ingress enabled by default.
This requires customers to connect existing GCP infrastructure to {PlatformNameShort} infrastructure manually. 
{PlatformNameShort} components that are deployed are isolated into their own VPC. 
Applications then run on instances managed by an instance group, which run on RHEL-based Google Compute machine images. 
These machine images are preloaded with required container images to run {PlatformNameShort} including {Hubname}, {ControllerName}, and {ReceptorRpm} components. 
A shared Google Filestore volume is mounted into each instance deployed by the instance group manager.

All GCP Compute instances have private IP addresses by default. 
The {PlatformNameShort} applications are run in containers managed through podman on the instances. 
This podman configuration is itself managed by systemd. 
SELinux is enabled on GCP Compute instances and is supported down to the container level. 
Each {ControllerName} instance is configured as an {PlatformNameShort} hybrid node by default to simplify the scale up and out procedures.

You cannot restart virtual machines, instead virtual machines must be replaced. You cannot  configure on virtual machines, because any configuration is lost when virtual machines are replaced. This always happens on upgrade.
