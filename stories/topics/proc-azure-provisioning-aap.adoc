= Provisioning {AAPonAzureName}

[role="_abstract"]
When you initiate the deployment of the {PlatformName} managed app from Azure marketplace, a form is displayed in the *Create Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure* window.

Before you fill in the form, decide whether you want to create a public or private deployment of {AAPonAzureNameShort}:

* Public deployments allow ingress to the {AAPonAzureNameShort} user interfaces over the public internet. No configuration is required to access the application URLs.
* Private deployments are created in an isolated Azure VNet that blocks access from the public internet. To access {AAPonAzureNameShort} user interfaces, you must configure network peering and routing.

You create the network configuration for the {AAPonAzureNameShort} VNet when you initiate the deployment.
Refer to your network configuration plan before deploying the managed application.
For information about planning your network configuration, see
xref:con-azure-network_azure-install[Network].

Complete the form to provision {PlatformName} infrastructure and resources into your Azure tenant.

. Click the *Basics* tab and enter values for your deployment in the following fields in the form:
  * *Subscription*: Select *Ansible on Clouds*.
  * *Resource Group*: Create or select a resource group where you want to deploy the managed application.
  * *Region*: The Azure region where the application will be deployed.
  * *Application Name*: A unique name for the managed application.
  * *Administrator Password*: Create an adminstrator password for your deployment.

The _Administrator Password_ must contain at least 8 characters, and must include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers.
  * *Confirm Administrator Password*: Confirm the _Administrator Password_.
  * *Access*: Choose whether your deployment will be public or private.
  * *Managed Resource Group*: A resource group for the managed application infrastructure.
+
Keep this resource group isolated from other resource groups, including the _Resource Group_ where you will deploy the managed application.
. Store the information that you entered in the form in a secure place. You will need to provide the _Administrator password_ to access {ControllerName} and private {HubName}.

. Click btn:[Create] to begin the provisioning process for the application.

The application will begin provisioning.

You can use the deployment engine to view the progress of your deployment a few minutes after the Azure console displays "Your deployment is complete".
See xref:azure-monitor-deployment-engine_azure-install[Monitoring deployments on the {PlatformNameShort} Deployment Engine] for more information.

It may take 30 minutes or longer for the infrastructure and software to fully provision.

Once provisioning is complete, you can access and login to your new {PlatformNameShort} instance and launch {ControllerName} and {HubName}.
