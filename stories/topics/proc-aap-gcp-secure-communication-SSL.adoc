= Securing internal communication with SSL

{AAPonGCP} is deployed with two internal application load balancers, one each in front of the hub and controller instances. 
These external load balancers must be configured with SSL certificates after deployment completes.

[NOTE]
====
Securing traffic through these internal load balancers is different than securing traffic through external load balancers in previous steps. 
This process ensures HTTP traffic is encrypted even when the traffic is localized to private GCP VPCs.
