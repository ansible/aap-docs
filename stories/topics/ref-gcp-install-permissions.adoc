= Policies and permissions

Your GCP account must have the following _Identity and Access Management_ (IAM) permissions to successfully create and manage {PlatformNameShort} deployments as well as the resources described in xref:con-gcp-application-architecture[Application architecture].

Your GCP account must also be licensed to deploy {AAPonGCP}.

The application can fail to deploy if your IAM policies restrict deployment and management of these resources. 

The application has two deployment options:

* Create a deployment with a new VPC.
* Create a deployment using an existing VPC.

Both options require the same minimum permissions
