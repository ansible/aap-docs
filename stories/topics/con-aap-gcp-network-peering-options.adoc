= Network peering options

Many networking configurations are possible, but the following configurations have been validated to work with {PlatformNameShort} on GCP by Red Hat.

Private deployments omit access from the public internet. 
This is the default deployment model based on the GCP architecture used by {PlatformNameShort} on GCP.

If you use this approach you must configure VPC peering, a transit network gateway, or similar GCP networking connectivity to access {PlatformNameShort} on GCP.  

When VPC peering and routing are configured, you can access {PlatformNameShort} through a VM on a connected VPC subnet, or directly if your organization has a transit routing setup between GCP and your local networks.

{PlatformNameShort} requires peering and routing for outbound communication to perform automations against devices on your AWS networks and connected on-prem or multi-cloud networks.

[NOTE]
====
VPC peering is required for {PlatformNameShort} to access resources that reside on private VPCs or where transit routing between {GCP} and your on-premises network(s) exist.

While every effort has been made to align with {GCP}â€™s documentation for this content, there may be a drift in accuracy over time. 
Use link:https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc-peering[GCP documentation] as the source of information regarding networking topics for GCP.

| Peering type | Description
| link:https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc-peering[VPC Peering] | VPCs are individually connected to one another with no other routing hops between them. 
This is a simple peering model and is useful when connecting a few networks. 
Complex peering can be configured, but routing can become more complex over time.
