= Network peering options

VPC deployments omit access from the public internet by default. 
This is also the deployment model for the GCP architecture used by {AAPonGCP}. 
Many networking configurations to access the platform are possible, but the following configurations have been validated to work with {AAPonGCP}.

When VPC peering and routing are configured, you can access {PlatformNameShort} through a VM on a connected VPC subnet, or directly if your organization has a transit routing setup between GCP and your local networks.

[NOTE]
====
VPC peering is required for {PlatformNameShort} to access resources that reside on private VPCs or where transit routing between {GCP} and your on-premises network(s) exist.

While every effort has been made to align with {GCP}â€™s documentation for this content, there may be a drift in accuracy over time. 
Use link:https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc-peering[GCP documentation] as the source of information regarding networking topics for GCP.
