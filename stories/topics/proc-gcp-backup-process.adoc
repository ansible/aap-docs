To backup and restore your {PlatformNameShort} deployment, it is vital to have your existing {PlatformNameShort} administration secret name and value recorded somewhere safe. In addition, it is also extremely important to take regular manual backups of the Cloud SQL database instance and filestore backups, to ensure a deployment can be restored as close as possible to its previous working state. The playbooks backup and restore provides backup and restore support for the {AAPonGCP} foundation deployment. 

[NOTE]
====
The restore process deploys a new {PlatformNameShort} with the filestore and SQL database instance being restored to the specified backup.

The backup process involves taking a backup of the Cloud SQL database and filestore instances at a given point in time.
The backup playbook require an active {AAPonGCP} foundation deployment to be running.

The following instructions describe how to run the backup playbook.

.Procedure
. Gather the following input variables to create an `extra_vars.yaml` file.
* *gcp_service_account_credentials_json_path*: Service account crendential JSON file path for the Google cloud account. This is the path within an `ansible-on-clouds-ops` container where the credentials JSON file is mounted to the `/secrets` directory. The path should be `/secrets/<service-account-creds-json-filename>`. 
+
Replace `<service-account-creds-json-filename>` with your Google service account credential filename.
+
[NOTE]
=====
To create the GCP credentials file, see, 
link:https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials[Create credentials] and 
link:https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete[Create and delete service account keys]
=====

* *gcp_deployment_name*: Deployment name which you want to backup.
* *gcp_compute_region*: GCP region where the foundation deployment is deployed.
* *gcp_compute_zone*: GCP zone where the foundation deployment is deployed.
+
[NOTE]
=====
You can find the region and zone from the filestore instance deployed with the foundation deployment. 
Look for the filestore with the name `<deployment-name>-filestore`.

* Make note of the location field that is your `gcp_compute_zone`. 
For example, the filestore instance location might be `us-east1-d`

* Remove the last two characters from the location that is your `gcp_compute_region`. 
For example, if your `gcp_compute_zone` location is `us-east1-d`, your region is `us-east1`.

----
+
. Pull the docker image for the `ansible-on-clouds-ops` container with a tag the same as the version of the foundation deployment.
+
[NOTE]
=====  
The `ansible-on-clouds-ops` container image tag must match the version of your foundation deployment. 
For example, if your foundation deployment version is 2.2.1, pull the `ansible-on-clouds-ops` image with tag 2.2.1.

== Running the backup playbook as a container

.Procedure
. Replace `<absolute path to Google application credentials dir>` with the path to the service account credential json file for the Google cloud.
. Replace `<absolute path of extra vars dir>` with the path to the directory where the `extra_vars.yaml` file you created in step 1 of the backup process. 
+
. Use the following command to run the playbook:
+
[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ docker run --rm \
-v <absolute path to google application credentials dir>:/secrets:ro \
-v <absolute path of extra vars dir>:/extra_vars:ro \
$IMAGE \
redhat.ansible_on_clouds.gcp_backup_deployment \
-e @/extra_vars/extra_vars.yaml
----
+
. Note the output of the playbook.
+
The playbook output resembles the following:
+
[source, bash]
----
TASK [redhat.ansible_on_clouds.standalone_gcp_backup : [backup_deployment] Print vars required for restore process] ***
ok: [localhost] => {
    "msg": [
        "AAP on GCP Backup successful. Please note below vars which are required for restore process.",
        "{ gcp_sql_backup_id: 1677552759614 , gcp_sql_backup_db_name: test-bnr-aap-db ,gcp_filestore_backup_name: test-bnr-filestore-iygs }"
    ]
}
----
+
Make a note of the SQL database backup ID, SQL batabase backup name and the filestore backup name. You will require these for the restore playbook.
