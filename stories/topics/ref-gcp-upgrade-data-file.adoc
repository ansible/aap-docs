= Updating the data file

You must populate the data file before triggering the upgrade. 
The following variables are parameters listed in the data file.

* `ansible_config_path`: (Optional) Only use if overriding with a custom ansible_config.
* `cloud_credentials_path` is the path to your AWS credentials file.
* `deployment_name` is the name of the foundation deployment. 
This is the same name you used when you deployed the foundation.
* `gcp_backup_taken`: Verification that a manual backup of the current deployment was recently created prior to running this upgrade.
Use `true` here to verify a recent backup was created.
* `gcp_compute_region`: GCP region that you provided when deploying foundation deployment. 
If you have not provided a region when deploying the foundation, use the default region `us-east1`` here.
* `gcp_compute_zone`: GCP zone that you provided when deploying foundation deployment. If you have not provided a zone when deploying the foundation, use the default us-east1-b here.


After populating the data file, it should resemble the following. 

The following values are provided as examples:
