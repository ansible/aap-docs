= Planning for your custom domain

[role="_abstract"]
Complete the following procedure to configure a custom domain for your {PlatformNameShort} deployment.

.Prerequisites
* Ensure that you have management privileges over the domain or subdomain you intend to use so that you can add multiple records.
* Ensure the DNS servers that you use to resolve records are accessible wherever you intend to use the domain.
* You must use the same format and domain for all URLs in the deployment (for example, `aap._example_.com`). 


.Procedure

. Identify the domain or subdomain that you intend to use.
. Create the TLS certificate. 
+
[NOTE]
====
Ensure that all subdomains are located in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) parameter so that the certificate can be valid for them.
====
+
As an alternative, you can also generate a wildcard certificate for subdomains of your primary custom domain.
+
[NOTE]
====
The RedHat SRE team requires an expiration date of at least one year or longer for current certificate rotation models supported by the service.
====
  
. Open a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/#/case/new/get-support?caseCreate=true[support ticket] with Red Hat requesting a custom URL configuration to your deployment supplying the following information:
* Company Name
* Deployment information (for example, `cus-xxxx`)
* Custom domain (for example, `aap._example_.com``)
* Certificate and private key (must be uploaded as separate files)
+ 
[NOTE]
====
Avoid providing password-protected files since that mmight prevent Red Hat SRE teamâ€™s ability to deploy them through service management automation.
====

. Wait for the SRE team to apply the configuration to your deployment and verify its functionality before proceeding to your next steps.
. After your configuration is complete, perform the following actions:
.. Log in to the {PlatformNameShort} Dashboard.
.. From the navigation panel, select menu:Settings[Automation Execution][System].
.. Apply the custom domain to your deployment. 
+
The {MenuTopAE} section will no longer display your original mesh-ingresses as peers. Instead, new ones will be generated, utilizing the custom domain. 
.. Reconfigure your execution nodes if you configured them previously with the old domain.
