= Planning for your custom domain

[role="_abstract"]
The following steps are required as preparatory activities to set up the custom URL.

.Prerequisites
* Ensure that you have management over the domain or subdomain you intend to use in order to add multiple records.
* Ensure the DNS servers that you use to resolve the record must be accessible wherever you intend to use the domain.
* Ensure that you use the same domain for all URLs in the deployment (for example, use `exampledomain.com` for custom URLs). 


.Procedure

. Identify the domain or subdomain that you intend to use.
. Create the TLS certificate. 
.. To ensure the validity of a TLS certificate for a custom domain, you must confirm that the certificate is generated for the platform record and all mesh-ingress records are included in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) parameter. Alternatively, you can opt to generate a wildcard certificate to cover the subdomains of your primary custom domain.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Red Hat SRE team requires an expiration date of at least one year or longer for current certificate rotation models supported by the service.
====
 
. Open a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/#/case/new/get-support?caseCreate=true[support ticket] with Red Hat requesting a custom URL configuration to your deployment and supply the following information:
* Company Name
* Deployment information (for example, `cus-xxxx`)
* Custom domain (for example, `_exampledomain_.com`)

. Allow the SRE team to apply the configuration to your deployment, verify the functionality, and collaborate with you on follow-up steps via the support ticket.
. After your configuration is complete, apply the custom domain to your deployment.
+
[NOTE]
====
Your original mesh-ingresses will not be available; new ones using the custom domain are created instead. 
====
+
. Reconfigure your execution nodes if you configured them previously with the old domain.
