== Architecture Description

{AAPonAWS} is designed to be private, with no public access or public egress installed by default. This requires customers to expose their infrastructure manually. 
Components deployed are isolated into their own _Virtual Private Cloud_ (VPC). 
Applications run on instances backed by an autoscale group, which run on RHEL-based _Amazon Machine Images_ (AMIs) as their basis. 
These AMIs are preloaded with all the required container images to run the {PlatformNameShort}, {HubName}, {ControllerName}, and {ReceptorRPM} components. 
A shared EFS volume is mounted into each instance stood up by the autoscale groups.

All internal instances have private IP addresses by default and internal traffic is encrypted by default through {AWS}. 
The {PlatformNameShort} application is run in containers managed through podman on the instances provisioned by the autoscale groups. 
This podman configuration is itself managed by systemd. 
SELinux is enabled on our instances and is supported down to the container level. 
Each {ControllerName} instance is configured as an {PlatformNameShort} hybrid node by default to simplify the scale up and out procedures.

You cannot restart virtual machines, instead virtual machines must be replaced. You cannot  configure on virtual machines, because any configuration is lost when virtual machines are replaced. This always happens on upgrade.
