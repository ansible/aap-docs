= Application deployment

Now that you have launched the public or private offer, you can begin configuration before deploying the application.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A temporary yet necessary constraint has been placed on the length of deployment names.
This is due to GCP's naming scheme for internal components that make up an {PlatformNameShort} deployment.
Component names based on this naming scheme can get too long and often break naming constraints imposed by other services, creating deployment errors.

The length of the name of your deployment, plus the length of your GCP project name must be less than 35 characters and the length of the deployment name must be less than 30 characters.

The calculation below will help you find the maximum length of the name of an {PlatformNameShort} deployment in your project.

length of deployment name < = (minimum between 30 and 35) - length(gcp project name)

There are two methods for deploying the application:
