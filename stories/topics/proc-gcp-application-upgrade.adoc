= Upgrading your deployment

You can upgrade your existing {AAPonGCP} deployment to the newer version. 
The upgrade process covers upgrading of {HubName} and {ControllerName}. 
The upgrade process takes roughly the same amount of time as a {AAPonGCP} deployment install. 

Use the following procedure to ensure a smooth upgrade process.

[NOTE]
====
{AAPonGCP} supports sequential upgrades. 
All upgrades should be no more than one major version behind the version you are currently upgrading to. 
<<<<<<< HEAD
For example, to upgrade {AAPonGCP} to 2.2.20230215, you must be on the first version of {AAPonGCP}.
====
=======
For example, to upgrade to {PlatformNameShort} from {GCPMarket} to 2.3.20230221, you must be on version 2.2.20230215.

.Prerequisites
* Docker must be installed to run the upgrade playbook.
* The upgrade process requires several volumes to be mounted. 
Prepare a fresh directory to be used for this process.

The following procedures form the upgrade process:

. Backup your {PlatformNameShort} 2.2 stack.
.. Pull the `ansible-on-clouds-ops` 2.2 container image
.. Prepare the environment
.. Run the `ansible-on-clouds-ops 2.2 container to backup the stack

. Upgrade {PlatformNameShort}.
.. Pull the `ansible-on-clouds-ops` 2.3 container image
.. Generate data files by running the `ansible-on-clouds-ops` container
.. Update the data file
.. Run the `ansible-on-clouds-ops` 2.3 container to upgrade your {PlatformNameShort} from {GCP Marketplace} deployment.

. (Optional) Restore the stack from backup.
.. Pull the ansible-on-clouds-ops 2.2 container image
.. Prepare the environment
.. Run the `ansible-on-clouds-ops` 2.2 container to restore the stack

= Backing up your {PlatformNameShort} stack

.Procedure

. Create the directories used to configure the upgrade process using the following commands:
+
[source,bash]
----
# Secrets directory. Store the GCP credentials file.
$ mkdir secrets
# Extra vars directory. All the configuration variables for the upgrade process.
$ mkdir extra_vars
----
+
. Store your service account credential JSON file in the secrets directory. 
+
[NOTE]
====
To create the GCP credentials file, see, 
link:https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials[Create credentials] and 
link:https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete[Create and delete service account keys]
====
+
. Gather the following input variables to create an `extra_vars.yaml` file within `extra_vars` dir.
* *gcp_service_account_credentials_json_path*:  Service account credential json file path for the Google cloud account.  This is the path within an `ansible-on-clouds-ops` container where the credentials JSON file is mounted to the `/secrets` directory. The path should be `/secrets/<service-account-creds-json-filename>`. 
+
Replace `<service-account-creds-json-filename>` with your Google service account credential filename.

* *gcp_deployment_name*: Deployment name that you want to upgrade.
* *gcp_compute_region*: GCP region that you provided when deploying foundation deployment. 
If you have not provided a region when deploying the foundation, use the default region `us-east1` here.
* *gcp_compute_zone*: GCP zone that you provided when deploying foundation deployment. 
If you have not provided a zone when deploying the foundation, use the default `us-east1-b` here.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can find the region and zone from the filestore instance deployed with the foundation deployment. 
Look for the filestore with the name `<deployment-name>-filestore`.

* Make note of the location field that is your `gcp_compute_zone`. 
For example, the filestore instance location might be `us-east1-d`

* Remove the last two characters from the location that is your `gcp_compute_region`. 
For example, if your `gcp_compute_zone` location is `us-east1-d`, your region is `us-east1`.
====
+
[source,bash]
----
gcp_service_account_credentials_json_path: "/secrets/<service-account-creds-json-filename>"
gcp_deployment_name: "" 
gcp_compute_region: ""
gcp_compute_zone: ""
----
+
. The final result should look similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----

= Running the upgrade playbook

The following instructions describe how to run the upgrade playbook.

.Procedure
. Pull the docker image for the `ansible-on-clouds-ops` container with a tag the same as the version of the foundation deployment.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `ansible-on-clouds-ops` container image tag must match the version of your foundation deployment. 
For example, if your foundation deployment version is 2.2.1, pull the `ansible-on-clouds-ops` image with tag 2.2.1.
====
=======
>>>>>>> 3cdc412e (Update the GCP Upgrade information)
+
. Pull the `ansible-on-clouds-ops 2.2` container image with the same tag version as the foundation deployment.

[source,bash]
----
$ export IMAGE=quay.io/ansible-on-clouds/ansible-on-clouds-ops:2.2.20230215-00
$ docker pull $IMAGE"
----
For EMEA regions (Europe, Middle East, Africa), run the following command instead:

[source, bash]
----
$ export IMAGE=quay.io/ansible-on-clouds/ansible-on-clouds-ops:2.2.20230215-00-limited
$ docker pull $IMAGE
