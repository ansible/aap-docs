= Service uptime

[role="_abstract"]
Uptime for {SaaSonAWS} is measured by user access and function of the {PlatformNameShort} control plane.
This is measured through the uptime of the product web user interface and REST APIs.

Measurements are calculated through successful HTTP response codes (200) to entry points of the UI and API.
If either of these return an unsuccessful response code, or are unavailable and time out entirely, then the service will be considered to be in an outage state.
Uptime of the execution plane, which is managed by customers, is not included as part of the uptime of the service.
Customers are responsible for ensuring that the execution plane is redundant, scalable, and available in order to meet customer uptime objectives.
