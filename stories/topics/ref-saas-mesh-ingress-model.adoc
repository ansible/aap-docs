= PUSH connectivity

You can design their {AutomationMesh} architecture using the push model and configure the communication ports. 
The default port is 27199. If you choose a different port ensure it does not conflict with an existing service, such as HTTPS. 
{SaaSonAWSShort} supports current {AutomationMesh} features that push communication to both hop nodes and execution nodes.
