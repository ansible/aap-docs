Customers have the flexibility to design their automation mesh architecture using the mesh ingress model including the ability to configure the ports on which automation mesh communicates. 
These ports must not conflict with existing traffic, like HTTPS.
{SaaSonAWSShort} supports current automation mesh capabilities that push communication about automation to automation mesh nodes; both hop nodes and execution nodes.
