= Google cloud ops agent configuration

The configuration file details can be found here.

The configuration file is located in `/etc/google-cloud-ops-agent.yaml` 
This is a symbolic link to the shared disk `/app/bootstrap/config_file_templates/controller/gcp-ops-agent-config.yaml` or `/app/bootstrap/config_file_templates/hub/gcp-ops-agent-config.yaml`  depending on the component type. 

As logging and monitoring is not enabled by default, the configuration contains the default configuration. 
If you want to add the logging or metrics, you can concatenate the files named `gcp-ops-agent-config-metric.yaml` and `gcp-ops-agent-config-logging.yaml` located in the same directory into the `gcp-ops-agent-config.yaml`.

A crontab job restarts the agent if `gcp-ops-agent-config.yaml` changed in the last 10 minutes and thus the agent rereads its configuration.

To have different configurations per {ControllerName} and {HubName}, the following procedure must be applied for each {ControllerName} or {HubName} for which you want a different configuration.
