= Configuring network peering with the {PlatformNameShort} subnet

Within the Azure console, the Azure virtual network (VNet) is known as _this virtual network_, and the VNet that you want to peer with is known as _remote virtual network_.

In the *Virtual Networks* page in the Azure portal, use the following settings to configure peering between the Azure VNet and the VNet that you want to peer with the {AAPonAzureNameShort} app:

* Under *Remote virtual network*, select the settings for the virtual network that you want to peer with Azure:
** *Summary*:
*** *Peering link name*: _<aap_to_hub_peering_link_name>_
** *Peering settings*:
*** *Traffic to remote virtual network*: _Allow_
*** *Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network*: _Allow_
* Under *Local virtual network*, select *Settings* the {AAPonAzureNameShort} virtual network:
** *Summary*:
*** *Peering link name*: _<hub_to_aap_peering_link_name>_
** *Peering settings*:
*** *Traffic to remote virtual network*: _Allow_
*** *Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network*: _Allow_
*** *Enable this virtual network to use peered VNet's remote gateway or Route Sever*: _Enabled_
