= Deployment scaling

Extension nodes will become available after the initial release of {AAPonAWS}. 
This documentation will be updated to describe how to purchase and connect extension nodes at that time.

If you want to scale your deployment beyond the initial number of supported managed nodes, {AAPonAWS} can be manually scaled using separately sold extension nodes. 
Extension nodes are additional compute instances that can be deployed to scale-up or scale-out depending on the immediate scaling requirements. 
If your requirements are for higher parallel automation operations you can select compute shapes that scale-up, while if you have a requirement to automate more nodes over time you can select compute shapes that scale out.

Extension nodes are the supported way of extending the capabilities of {AAPonAWS}.  

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat does not support environments that are extended through customer design and implementation.
