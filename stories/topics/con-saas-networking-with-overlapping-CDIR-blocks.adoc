= Networking with overlapping CDIR blocks

Automation mesh enables connectivity between the control plane and multiple networks that use the same Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block (that is, the same class A address space repeated across different clouds or data centers). 
Execution nodes treat the network in which they are deployed as the local network. 
You need at least one execution node instance paired with an instance group to target automation in each of the networks.
