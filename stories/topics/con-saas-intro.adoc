= Introduction 
{SaaSonAWS} links your {AWS} (AWS) offering to your Red{nbsp}Hat account which enables access to {PlatformNameShort}. 
When you subscribe to {SaaSonAWSShort}, Red{nbsp}Hat deploys and configures an  {PlatformNameShort} environment for you. 

From here you can access the control plane which allows you to run and manage your automation. You can run automation through mesh ingress or self-managed hop nodes. 
You can connect execution nodes through an egress model from your environment using mesh ingress.
Alternatively, mesh ingress sets up hop nodes on the controller and then you can peer execution nodes to them.
