Red{nbsp}Hat maintains daily database and file system snapshots in a separate region from each deployment.  

|===
| Component   | Snapshot Frequency | Retention Policy
| Database    | Daily              | 7 days
| File System | Daily              | 7 days

This recovery data is used if an AWS regional outage cannot be resolved in a reasonable time.

Customer data is replicated to a predefined secondary region based on the deployment region. The currently paired regions are:

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
| Primary Region          | Business Continuity Region

| ap-south-1              | ap-southeast-2
| ap-east-1               | ap-south-1
| ap-southeast-2          | ap-south-1
| ca-central-1            | us-east-2
| eu-central-1            | eu-central-2
| eu-west-1               | eu-north-1
| eu-west-2               | eu-west-1
| us-east-1               | us-west-2
| us-east-2               | us-west-2

To recover an {PlatformNameShort} deployment in a different AWS region, a customer must submit a request specifying their preferred deployment region from the available options.
Red{nbsp}Hat evaluates the request and begins building an instance in that region.
Data from the previous instance is recovered from the customerâ€™s business continuity region.
The customer is responsible for any necessary post-deployment network configuration to integrate the new instance into their environment.


[NOTE]
====
Backup data is not directly accessible to customers. 
The data is only used in the event of infrastructure failure, not customer configuration errors. 
Red{nbsp}Hat encourages using configuration-as-code practices to maintain a customer-hosted backup of your configuration.
