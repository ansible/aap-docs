= Add and Remove Tags

{AAPonAWS} supports stack-level tagging during stack deployment time. A stack-level tag is applied to the stack itself and all tag supported components that make up the stack.

Using the add or remove tags playbooks will only update the tags for the individual components of stack and not the tag applied to the stack itself. The stack-level tags will never be modified after deploying {AAPonAWS}.
