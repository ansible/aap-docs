= Add and Remove Tags

Tags are custom fields that you assign to an AWS resource to help organize and identify your instances. {AAPonAWS} supports stack-level tagging during stack deployment time. A stack-level tag, when applied to the stack itself, is also applied to all tag supported components that make up the stack.

Using the add or remove tags playbooksnonly update the tags for the individual components of stack and not the tag applied to the stack itself. Stack-level tags are never modified after deployment.
