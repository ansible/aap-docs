= Key benefits of private link connectivity 

[role="_abstract"]
To ensure maximum network isolation and security, PrivateLink connectivity establishes a private connection for the {SaaSonAWSShort}, which is essential because:

* It enables the {SaaSonAWSShort} control plane to connect to project and execution environment repositories hosted on private networks that are inaccessible from the public internet.
* It keeps automation mesh data within a private network rather than traversing the public internet.  

[NOTE]
====
Automation mesh uses industry standard TLS encryption regardless of how automation mesh nodes are connected.
Consider this traffic secured in the same manner as all TLS traffic.
