= Maintain your service principals

Service principal credentials have a limited lifetime that is set in your {MSEntraID} configuration.
Track the lifespan of the service principal if you intend to automate against Azure for an extended period of time.
You can create a new one when needed.

To view records of updated or deleted service principles, run the following Azure CLI command:

-----
az ad sp list -o table | grep ansible
-----

This command does not display the secrets for your service principals. Delete the service principal and create a new one if the secret is lost.

When you create a new service principal to replace an expired or deleted one, you must update the credential that uses the service principal that you are replacing. 
If the credential is not updated, automations that use that credential will fail.
