This is a Techical Preview feature. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service-level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them for production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
====

The restore process deploys a new deployment, and restores the filestore and SQL database instance to the specified backup.

[NOTE]
=====
The restored filestore instance uses CIDR network range `192.168.244.0/29`, which is different from the default network filestore network range of the backup deployment.
=====

The following instructions describe how to run the restore playbook.

.Procedure
. Gather the following input variables to create an `extra_vars.yaml` file.
* *gcp_service_account_credentials_json_path*: Service account crendential JSON file path for the Google cloud account. This is the path within an `ansible-on-clouds-ops` container where the credentials JSON file is mounted to the `/secrets` directory. The path should be `/secrets/<service-account-creds-json-filename>`.
+
Replace `<service-account-creds-json-filename>` with your Google service account credential filename.
+
[NOTE]
=====
To create the GCP credentials file, see, 
link:https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials[Create credentials] and 
link:https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete[Create and delete service account keys]
=====
+
* *gcp_deployment_name*: Deployment name which you backed up.
* *gcp_restored_deployment_name*: Deployment name of restored AAP foundation created by playbook.
* *gcp_compute_region*: GCP region where the foundation deployment is deployed.
* *gcp_compute_zone*: GCP zone where the foundation deployment is deployed.
+
[NOTE]
=====
You can find the region and zone from the filestore instance deployed with the foundation deployment. 
Look for the filestore with the name `<deployment-name>-filestore`.

* Make note of the location field that is your `gcp_compute_zone`. 
For example, the filestore instance location might be `us-east1-d`

* Remove the last two characters from the location that is your `gcp_compute_region`. 
For example, if your `gcp_compute_zone` location is `us-east1-d`, your region is `us-east1`.
=====
+
* *gcp_filestore_backup_name*: The backup name where the filestore instance backup is stored. 
You receive this after executing the backup playbook.
* *gcp_sql_backup_id*: Backup ID of the Cloud SQL database instance to use when restoring the deployment. 
You receive this after executing the backup playbook.
* *gcp_sql_backup_db_name*: GCP foundation SQL database name. 
You receive this after executing backup the playbook.

. Pull the docker image for the `ansible-on-clouds-ops` container with a tag the same as the version of the foundation deployment.
+
[NOTE]
=====
The `ansible-on-clouds-ops` container image tag must match the version of your foundation deployment. 
For example, if your foundation deployment version is 2.2.1, pull the `ansible-on-clouds-ops` image with tag 2.2.1.

== Running the restore playbook as a container

.Procedure
. Replace `<absolute path to Google application credentials dir>` with the path to the service account credential JSON file for the Google cloud.
. Replace `<absolute path of extra vars dir>` with the path to the directory where the `extra_vars.yaml` file you created in step one of the backup process. 
+
. Use the following command to run the playbook.
+
[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ docker run --rm \
-v <absolute path to Google application credentials dir>:/secrets:ro \
-v <absolute path of extra vars dir>:/extra_vars:ro \
$IMAGE \
redhat.ansible_on_clouds.gcp_restore_deployment \
-e @/extra_vars/extra_vars.yaml
----
+
. When you have run the playbook, a new restored deployment is visible in GCP deployment. 
It can take a few minutes for the deployment to finish and for all the containers to run.
+
[NOTE]
=====
Access to the restored deployment must be configured through either an external load balancer or VPN. 
When a connection method is configured you can log in to {PlatformName} {ControllerName} and {HubName} using your old deployment credentials. 
In addition, all job history, uploaded collections and other records must be in the same state as the restored deployment.
