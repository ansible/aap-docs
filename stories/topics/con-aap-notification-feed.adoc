= Product Notification Feed 

[role="_abstract"]

Effective July 2025, the {PlatformNameShort} RSS notification feed will be available. 
This feed serves as a method for communicating various product updates and changes to customers. 

Customers can subscribe to the notifications by visiting link:announcements.ansiblecloud.redhat.com/feed.atom[announcements.ansiblecloud.redhat.com/feed.atom]. 
Using an RSS feed reader, customers will be updated with events such as {PlatformNameShort} upgrades and system maintenance.

All {PlatformNameShort} customers can subscribe to this content. Messages include categorization tags to specify deployment types: managed, self-managed (on-prem), or a combination. Red Hat is developing a future enhancement to integrate this feature directly into the UI.
