== Architecture Description

{AAPonGCP} was designed to be private, with no public ingress enabled by default.
This requires customers to connect existing GCP infrastructure to {PlatformNameShort} infrastructure manually. 
{PlatformNameShort} components that are deployed are isolated into their own VPC. 
Applications then run on instances managed by an instance group, which run on RHEL-based Google Compute machine images. 
These machine images are preloaded with required container images to run {PlatformNameShort} including {Hubname}, {ControllerName}, and {ReceptorRpm} components. 
A shared Google Filestore volume is mounted into each instance deployed by the instance group manager.

All GCP Compute instances have private IP addresses by default. 
The {PlatformNameShort} applications are run in containers managed through podman on the instances. 
This podman configuration is itself managed by systemd. 
SELinux is enabled on GCP Compute instances and is supported down to the container level. 
Each {ControllerName} instance is configured as an {PlatformNameShort} hybrid node by default to simplify the scale up and out procedures.
