= Connectivity

In general, the execution plane should be able to communicate to the control plane when the following conditions are met:

* Polling (mesh-ingress): Execution nodes must be able to route stateful egress traffic to the domain of the {PlatformNameShort} deployment over port 443.
* Push: A configurable firewall port must be opened within a customerâ€™s remote networks to allow for {PlatformNameShort} to push information to execution nodes.

You can configure automation mesh nodes behind firewalls, proxy servers, and similar services. 
These services route or proxy traffic originating from {PlatformNameShort} without altering headers, payload, or other information that would affect functionality of the automation mesh.
