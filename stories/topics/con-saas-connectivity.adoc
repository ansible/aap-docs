= Connectivity

The execution plane can communicate with the control plane under the following conditions:

* Polling (mesh-ingress): Execution nodes must route stateful egress traffic to the {PlatformNameShort} deployment domain over port 443.
* Push: A configurable firewall port must be open in the customerâ€™s remote networks to allow {PlatformNameShort} to push information to execution nodes.

You can configure automation mesh nodes behind firewalls, proxy servers, and similar services. 
These services route or proxy traffic originating from {PlatformNameShort} without altering headers, payload, or other information that would affect functionality of the automation mesh.
