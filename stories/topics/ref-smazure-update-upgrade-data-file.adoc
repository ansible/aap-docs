You must populate the data file before triggering the upgrade. Each parameter is required unless it is noted as optional. If the parameter is noted as optional, both its key and value can be removed from the data file.

* `ansible_config_path` (Optional) Only use if overriding with a custom `ansible_config`.
* `cloud_credentials_path` is the path to your GCP credentials file.
* `deployment_name` is the name of the foundation deployment. 
* ....

After populating the data file, it should resemble the following. 

The following values are provided as examples:
