= Ansible Automation Platform Controller API

API endpoints for Controller must contain a trailing slash in order for requests to go through. Automatic trailing slash redirects are not supported in this current offering of {AAPonGCP}. For example a request such as `<controller_base_url>/api/v2/metrics` times out while `<controller_base_url>/api/v2/metrics/` goes through.
