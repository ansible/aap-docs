= Updating the data file

If you do not require a parameter, remove that parameter from the configuration file.

.Procedure
* Edit the `/tmp/logging-monitoring.yml` file and set the following parameters:

* `ansible_config_path` is used by default as the standard configuration for the `ansible-on-cloud offering` but if you have extra requirements in your environment you can specify your own. 
* `cloud_credentials_path` is the absolute path toward your credentials. 
This must be an absolute path.
* `deployment_name` is the name of the deployment.
* `components` is an array containing the type of component where you want to do the setup. 
The default is [ “controller”, “hub” ] which means that the logging monitoring will be enabled on both {controllerName} and {HubName}.
* `monitoring_enabled` is set to `true` to enable the monitoring, `false` otherwise. Default = `false`.
* `logging_enabled` is set to `true` to enable the logging, `false` otherwise. Default = `false`.
* `default_collector_interval` is the periodicity at which the monitoring data must be send to the Google Cloud. 
Default = 59s.

[NOTE]
==== 
The Google cost of this service depends on that periodicity and so the higher the value of the collector interval, the less it will cost.
====
+ 
Do not set values less than 59 seconds.

[NOTE]
====
If monitoring and logging is disabled, the value of 'default_collector_interval' is automatically set to `0`.
