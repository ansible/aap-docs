= Custom domain

{PlatformNameShort} control plane is accessible through its user interfaces, APIs, and mesh ingresses. While each service instance has an auto-generated Red Hat URL, you can set up a custom domain. This customization process varies based on whether you plan to use {AWSPrivateLink}. 

Custom domains require you to configure three DNS records. Implementation of these DNS records depends on your connectivity model, and the convention for each of the DNS records is as follows:

* `platform.<optional_subdomain.exampledomain.com>`
* `mesh-ingress-0.<optional_subdomain.exampledomain.com>`
* `mesh-ingress-1.<optional_subdomain.exampledomain.com>`

You can create custom subdomains under the domain you own.
