= Secrets Update

When you update any secrets in the GCP secret manager, ensure that the latest secret version is enabled. For example, if you have two secret versions for a `<deployment-name>-aap-admin` secret, secret version 2 must be enabled, where `<deployment-name>` is the name of your foundation deployment.
