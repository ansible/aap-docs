After accessing your {PlatformNameShort} instance, you can confirm that there is only a control node, and mesh ingress hop nodes on the *Instances* page or *Topology* page. 
Before you can start automation jobs you must add remote execution nodes to the cluster, or connect an OpenShift cluster as a container group. 
For help with configuring execution nodes see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.4/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_automation_mesh_for_operator-based_installations/index[Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Automation Mesh for operator-based installations]
