= Restore Process

The restore process deploys a new deployment, and restores the filestore and SQL database instance to the specified backup.

[NOTE]
=====
* You must restore with the same operational image version as the backup.

* You can restore using either a new VPC network or an existing one. 
You require additional parameters to restore on an existing VPC network.
