[role="_abstract"]
You can self-service deployments including, but not limited to, the following operations:

* Buy and deploy an {PlatformNameShort} on AWS environment.
* Cancel an {PlatformNameShort} on AWS environment subscription.

When you cancel or do not renew a subscription in the AWS Marketplace, the service begins the deprovisioning process 72 hours after the cancellation. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
The system keeps an encrypted backup for a limited time after unsubscription to prevent data loss from accidental unsubscription.

You may request a complete purge of the backup data after unsubscription, with the understanding that there is permanent data loss.
====

If you initiate a cancellation, your deployment will begin to shut down.
If you initiated the cancellation in error you have 72 hours from the initial cancellation to submit a link:https://access.redhat.com/support[Support ticket] and the Red Hat team will assist you in recovering the cancelled deployment.
