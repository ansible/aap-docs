= SRE access and management

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) access is specific to the infrastructure and services running {PlatformNameShort}. 
Red Hat does not access the {PlatformNameShort} interfaces or APIs except for extenuating circumstances, such as a support engagement that requires it. 
In such cases, access is provided by the customer to the SRE team for troubleshooting those issues.

SRE access to control plane resources is limited to operations that must be performed by a person and cannot be automated. 
In such cases, any access to a particular control plane follows a request-and-approval process, and the access is audited, to ensure that only permitted personnel have access to perform these operations.

The following describes the process that SREs use to access resources and the audit data that is captured whenever an operation against resources is performed.
