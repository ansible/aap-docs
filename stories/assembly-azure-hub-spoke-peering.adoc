= Hub-and-spoke peering (Transit routes)

:context: azure-hub-spoke-peering

[role="_abstract"]
The Hub-and-spoke peering model establishes a centralized hub VNet for managing private network communication and transit routing between your existing spoke networks and the dedicated {PlatformNameShort} VNet. 

[NOTE]
====
Updating route tables incorrectly can break your network. Only execute the steps in these procedures if you are confident that you can reverse any unexpected network behavior.
