:context: azure-support

{AAPonAzureName} is a managed application, supported and maintained by Red Hat.
Due to the architecture of the application and the deployment strategy in Azure, there are a few situations where customizing and changing some aspects of the configuration could lead to a change in the responsibilities of some components.

.Azure Virtual Appliance Routing with {AAPonAzureNameShort}

As an {AAPonAzureNameShort} user, you can configure the {PlatformNameShort} network to peer your own network.
By doing so, you can grant access from the {PlatformNameShort} instance to all the assets associated with your own network that you want to manage.
Also, you can route all the {PlatformNameShort} traffic to your own Virtual Network Appliances to control, audit, or block traffic from the {PlatformNameShort} instance to the internet.
To do this, you must consider the URLs that need to be allowlisted for {PlatformNameShort} to work properly.

.Private DNS Zones

{AAPonAzureNameShort} uses Azure's managed DNS services when deployed.

To use private DNS records that cannot be resolved publicly, you can either use Azure Private DNS Zones that are peered to the managed application VNET, or you can make a submit request to Red Hat to submit DNS zones that should be forwarded to a customer-managed private DNS server.

A limitation of Private DNS Zones is that only one instance of a given zone may be linked to a Virtual Network.
Attempting to link zones that match the names of Private DNS Zones in the managed resource group will cause conflicts.
Microsoft recommends consolidating DNS records into a single zone to work around this limitation.

You can replicate the records from the zones in the managed resource group into your own instance of the Private DNS Zone.
You can then unlink Private DNS Zones in the managed resource group from the Virtual Network and replace it with your own instance of the Private DNS Zone.

Failure to properly maintain the records in the Private DNS Zone can prevent the managed application from operating.

For more information about working with Private DNS Zones, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6983525[Private DNS with Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure] article on the Red Hat customer portal.

.Microsoft Azure Policy

Azure Policy is a tool that enforces compliance of Azure resources to defined standards.
Use cases for Azure Policy are the enforcement of naming schemes, deployment regions, and the consistent application of tags.

In some situations, using Azure Policy to enforce, for example, tagging rules and conventions, can adversely affect the Resource Group where the components of {AAPonAzureNameShort} reside.
The enforcement of Azure Policy could prevent changes, impact operations, or block deployment of new components in the Resource Group.
These situations are identified by Red Hat during maintenance or daily operations.
You must exclude the enforcement of Azure Policy, for example by using exceptions, on resources associated with the managed application.
