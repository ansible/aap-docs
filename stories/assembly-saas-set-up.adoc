= Setting up {SaaSonAWS}

{SaaSonAWS} users have access to {PlatformNameShort} (AAP) without the need to manage the infrastructure. 
{SaaSonAWSShort} deploys and configures a Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) cluster for you. 
SaaS deploys on top of your ROSA cluster, which enables you to run it on the {OCPShort} (OCP).

To set up {SaaSonAWS} you must link your AWS and Red Hat accounts through the AWS marketplace.
When you link your accounts you can configure your cluster through the *Provision environment* page on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console.
